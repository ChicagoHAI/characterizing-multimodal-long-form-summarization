We help our clients build leadership teams by facilitating the recruitment, management and development of senior executives. We believe focusing on top-level services offers us several advantages that include access to and influence with key decision makers, increased potential for recurring search consulting engagements, higher fees per search, enhanced brand visibility and a leveraged global footprint, which create added barriers to entry for potential competitors. Working at the top of client organizations also allows us to attract and retain high-caliber consultants.\nIn addition to executive search, we provide consulting services including executive leadership assessment, leadership, team and board development, succession planning, talent strategy, people performance, inter-team collaboration, culture shaping and organizational transformation.\nWe provide our services to a broad range of clients through the expertise of over 400 consultants located in major cities around the world. Our executive search services are provided on a retained basis. Revenue before reimbursements of out-of-pocket expenses ( net revenue\u201d) consists of retainers and indirect expenses billed to clients. Typically, we are paid a retainer for our executive search services equal to approximately one-third of the estimated first-year compensation for the position to be filled. In addition, if the actual compensation of a placed candidate exceeds the estimated compensation, we often are authorized to bill the client for one-third of the excess. Indirect expenses are calculated as a percentage of the retainer with certain dollar limits per search.\nKey Performance Indicators\nWe manage and assess our performance through various means, with primary financial and operational measures including net revenue, operating income, operating margin, Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) and Adjusted EBITDA margin (non-GAAP).\nExecutive Search and Heidrick Consulting performance is also measured using consultant headcount. Specific to Executive Search, confirmation trends, consultant productivity and average revenue per search are used to measure performance.\nRevenue is driven by market conditions and a combination of the number of executive search engagements and leadership consulting and culture shaping projects and the average revenue per search or project. With the exception of compensation expense, incremental increases in revenue do not necessarily result in proportionate increases in costs, particularly operating and administrative expenses, thus creating the potential to improve operating margins.\nThe number of consultants, confirmation trends, number of searches or projects completed, productivity levels and the average revenue per search or project will vary from quarter to quarter, affecting net revenue and operating margin.\nOur Compensation Model\nAt the Executive Search consultant level, there are fixed and variable components of compensation. Individuals are rewarded for their performance based on a system that directly ties a portion of their compensation to the amount of net revenue for which they are responsible. A portion of the reward may be based upon individual performance against a series of non-financial measures. Credit towards the variable portion of an executive search consultant's compensation is earned by generating net revenue for winning and executing work. Each quarter, we review and update the expected annual performance of all Executive Search consultants and accrue variable compensation accordingly. The amount of variable compensation that is accrued for each Executive Search consultant is based on a tiered payout model. Overall Company performance determines the amount available for total variable compensation. The more net revenue that is generated by the consultant, the higher the percentage credited towards the consultant's variable compensation and thus accrued by our Company as expense.\nAt the Heidrick Consulting consultant level, there are also fixed and variable components of compensation. Overall compensation is determined based on the total economic contribution of the Heidrick Consulting segment to the business as a whole. Individual consultant compensation can vary, and is derived from credits earned for delivering client work plus credits earned for contributions of intellectual and human capital, client relationship development and consulting practice development. Each quarter, we review and update the expected annual performance of all Heidrick Consulting consultants and accrue variable compensation accordingly.\nThe mix of individual consultants who generate revenue in Executive Search and economic contributions in Heidrick Consulting can significantly affect the total amount of compensation expense recorded, which directly impacts operating margin. As a result, the variable portion of the compensation expense may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. The total variable compensation is discretionary, and is based on Company-wide financial targets approved by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.\nA portion of our Executive Search consultants' and management cash bonuses is deferred and paid over a three-year vesting period. The compensation expense related to the amounts being deferred is recognized on a graded vesting attribution method over the requisite service period. This service period begins on January 1 of the respective fiscal year and continues through the deferral date, which coincides with our bonus payments in the first quarter of the following year, and for an additional three year vesting period. The deferrals are recorded in Accrued salaries and employee benefits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n2018 Overview\nConsolidated net revenue was $716.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $94.6 million, or 15.2%, compared to 2017. Executive Search net revenue was $652.9 million in 2018, an increase of $100.8 million compared to 2017. The increase in Executive Search net revenue was the result of growth in the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. Our acquisition of Amrop A/S (\"Amrop\") in January 2018 also contributed to the growth in Executive Search net revenue. The net impact of the new revenue recognition standard increased Executive Search net revenue by approximately $8.0 million. The number of Executive Search consultants was 353 as of December 31, 2018, compared to 346 as of December 31, 2017. Executive Search productivity, as measured by annualized net Executive Search revenue per consultant, was $1.9 million and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The number of confirmed searches increased 11.8%, compared to 2017. The average revenue per executive search increased to $127,300 in 2018, compared to $120,300 in 2017. Heidrick Consulting net revenue decreased $6.2 million, or 9.0%, to $63.1 million in 2018, from $69.4 million in 2017. Heidrick Consulting net revenue declined by approximately $3.8 million due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard and its impact on revenue associated with enterprise agreements. The number of Heidrick Consulting consultants was 66 as of December 31, 2018, compared to 64 as of December 31, 2017.\nOperating income as a percentage of net revenue was 9.6% in 2018, compared to an operating loss margin of 4.3% in 2017. The change in operating income was primarily due to an increase in net revenue of $94.6 million and the impact of impairment\ncharges and restructuring charges of $50.7 and $15.6 million, respectively, in 2017, partially offset by an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense of $72.1 million. Salaries and employee benefits expense as a percentage of net revenue was 70.7% in 2018 and 69.9% in 2017. General and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue was 19.7% in 2018 and 23.7% in 2017.\nWe ended the year with combined cash and cash equivalents of $279.9 million, an increase of $72.3 million compared to $207.5 million at December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to the strong cash inflows from operations partially offset by acquisition spend, restructuring payments and larger bonus payments year over year. We pay the majority of bonuses in the first quarter following the year in which they were earned. Employee bonuses are accrued throughout the year and are based on the Company's performance and the performance of the individual employee. We expect to pay approximately $202.0 million in bonuses related to 2018 performance in March and April 2019. In January 2019, we paid approximately $14.0 million in cash bonuses deferred in prior years.\n2019 Outlook\nWe are currently forecasting 2019 first quarter net revenue of between $165 million and $175 million. Our 2019 first quarter guidance is based upon, among other things, management's assumptions for the anticipated volume of new executive search confirmations and leadership consulting and culture shaping projects, the current backlog, consultant productivity, consultant retention, the seasonality of our business and average currency rates from December 2018.\nOur 2019 first quarter guidance is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those disclosed under \"Item 1A - Risk Factors\" and in this \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" included in this Form 10-K. As such, actual results could vary from these projections.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, the results of operations (in thousands, except per share

We believe that our available cash balances together with the funds expected to be generated from operations and funds available under our committed revolving credit facility will be sufficient to finance our operations for the foreseeable future, as well as to finance the cash payments associated with our cash dividends and stock repurchase program.\nWe pay the non-deferred portion of annual bonuses in the first quarter following the year in which they are earned. Employee bonuses are accrued throughout the year and are based on our performance and the performance of the individual employee.\nLines of Credit. On October 26, 2018, the Company entered into a new Credit Agreement (the \"2018 Credit Agreement\") to replace the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"Restated Credit Agreement\") executed on June 30, 2015. The 2018 Credit Agreement provides the Company with a senior unsecured revolving line of credit with an aggregate commitment of $175 million, which includes a sublimit of $25 million for letters of credit, and a $10 million swingline loan sublimit. The agreement also includes a $75 million expansion feature. The 2018 Credit Agreement will mature in October 2023. Borrowings under the 2018 Credit Agreement bear interest at the Company's election of the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the 2018 Credit Agreement) or Adjusted LIBOR (as defined in the 2018 Credit Agreement) plus a spread as determined by the Company's leverage ratio.\nBorrowings under the 2018 Credit Agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, Permitted Acquisitions (as defined in the 2018 Credit Agreement) and for other general purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries. The obligations under the 2018 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of the Company's subsidiaries.\nThe Company capitalized approximately $1.0 million of loan acquisition costs related to the 2018 Credit Agreement, which will be amortized over the remaining term of the agreement.\nBefore October 26, 2018, the Company was party to its Restated Credit Agreement, which was executed on June 30, 2015. The Restated Credit Agreement provided a single senior unsecured revolving line of credit with an aggregate commitment of up to $100 million, which included a sublimit of $25 million for letters of credit, and a $50 million expansion feature. Borrowings under the Restated Credit Agreement bore interest at the Company's election of the existing Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Restated Credit Agreement) or the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (as defined in the Restated Credit Agreement) plus a spread as determined by the Company's leverage ratio.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company borrowed $20 million under the Restated Credit Agreement and elected the Adjusted LIBOR Rate. The Company subsequently repaid $8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and $12 million during the three months ended June 30, 2018.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company borrowed $40 million under the Restated Credit Agreement and elected the Adjusted LIBOR rate. The Company subsequently repaid $15 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and $25 million during the three months ended June 30, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under either the 2018 Credit Agreement or the Restated Credit Agreement. The Company was in compliance with the financial and other covenants under both facilities and no event of default existed.\nCash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2018 were $279.9 million, an increase of $72.4 million compared to $207.5 million at December 31, 2017. The $279.9 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2018 includes $112.1 million held by our foreign subsidiaries. A portion of the $112.1 million is considered permanently reinvested in these foreign subsidiaries. If these funds were required to satisfy obligations in the United States, the repatriation of these funds could cause us to incur additional foreign withholding taxes. We expect to pay approximately $202.0 million in variable compensation related to 2018 performance in March and April 2019. In January 2019, we paid approximately $14.0 million in variable compensation that was deferred in prior years.\nCash flows provided by operating activities. In 2018, cash provided by operating activities was $102.9 million, principally reflecting net income net of non-cash charges of $68.6 million, an increase in accrued expenses of $71.5 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $16.8 million and restructuring payments of $11.6 million. The increase in accrued expenses primarily reflects approximately $202.0 million of current year bonus accruals, partially offset by $148.0 million of bonus payments for 2017 made in early 2018.\nIn 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $67.0 million, principally reflecting net income net of non-cash charges of $21.1 million, an increase in accrued expenses of $18.3 million and a restructuring accrual of $13.0 million. The increase in accrued expenses primarily reflects approximately $148 million of current year bonus accruals, partially offset by $128 million of bonus payments for 2016 made in early 2017.\nIn 2016, cash provided by operating activities was $21.9 million, principally reflecting net income net of non-cash charges of $41.3 million and an increase in the net retirement and pension plan liability of $4.2 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $14.4 million, a change in other assets and liabilities of $3.0 million, a change in accrued liabilities of $3.8 million and an increase in prepaid expenses of $2.3 million.\nCash flows used in investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to capital expenditures of $6.0 million, the acquisition of Amrop for $3.1 million and purchases of available for sale securities of $2.2 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities of $3.0 million. The increase in capital expenditures is primarily the result of office build-outs and a global information technology update.\nCash used in investing activities was $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to capital expenditures of $14.0 million and purchases of available for sale securities of $2.3 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities of $1.4 million. The increase in capital expenditures is primarily the result of office build-outs and a global information technology update.\nCash used in investing activities was $35.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the acquisitions of JCA Group, DSI and Philosophy IB, capital expenditures of $5.3 million and the purchase of available for sale securities of $2.5 million.\nCash flows used in financing activities. Cash used in financing activities in 2018 was $17.0 million due to cash dividend payments of $10.2 million, earnout payments related to the JCA Group acquisitions of $3.6 million and the payment of employee tax withholdings on equity transactions of $2.2 million. Gross proceeds and payments on the Company's line of credit were each $20.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCash used in financing activities in 2017 was $17.1 million due to cash dividend payments of $10.1 million, earnout payments related to the Co Company and Scambler MacGregor acquisitions of $4.6 million and the payment of employee tax withholdings on equity transactions of $2.4 million. Gross proceeds and payments on the Company's line of credit were each $40.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCash used in financing activities in 2016 was $17.2 million due to cash dividend payments of $10.0 million, earnout payments for the Senn Delaney, Scambler MacGregor and Co Company acquisitions of $4.6 million, and the payment of employee tax withholdings on equity transactions of $2.7 million.\nOn February 11, 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase shares of our common stock with an aggregate total amount up to $50 million. We intend from time to time and as business conditions warrant to purchase shares of our common stock on the open market or in negotiated or block trades. No time limit has been set for completion of this program. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in 2018. The most recent purchase of shares of common stock occurred during the year ended December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2018, we have purchased 1,038,670 shares of our common stock for a total of $28.3 million and $21.7 million remains available for future purchases under the authorization. Unless terminated or extended earlier by resolution of the Board of Directors, the program will expire when the amount authorized for repurchases has been spent.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements. We do not have material off-balance sheet arrangements, special purpose entities, trading activities of non-exchange traded contracts or transactions with related parties.\nContractual obligations. The following table presents our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018, and the expected timing of cash payments related to these contractual obligations (in millions):\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due for the years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>151.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset retirement obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>154.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Represents the fair value of the obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets primarily related to our obligation at the end of the lease term to return office space to the landlord in its original condition.\nIn addition to the contractual obligations included in the above table, we have liabilities related to certain employee benefit plans. These liabilities are recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018. The obligations related to these employee benefit plans are described in Note 12, Employee Benefit Plans, and Note 13, Pension Plan and Life Insurance Contract, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As the timing of cash disbursements related to these employee benefit plans is uncertain, we have not included these obligations in the above table. The table excludes our liability for uncertain tax positions including accrued interest and penalties, which totaled $1.5 million as of December 31, 2018, since we cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3, Revenue, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. If actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known.\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, there are different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur periodically, that could materially impact the financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue recognition. In our Executive Search segment, revenue is recognized as we satisfy our performance obligations by transferring a good or service to a client. Generally, each of our executive search contracts contain one performance obligation which is the process of identifying potentially qualified candidates for a specific client position. In most contracts, the transaction price includes both fixed and variable consideration. Fixed compensation is comprised of a retainer, equal to approximately one-third of the estimated first year compensation for the position to be filled, and indirect expenses, equal to a specified percentage of the retainer, as defined in the contract. The Company generally bills its clients for its retainer and indirect expenses in one-third increments over a three-month period commencing in the month of a client's acceptance of the contract. If actual compensation of a placed candidate exceeds the original compensation estimate, the Company is often authorized to bill the client for one-third of the excess compensation. The Company refers to this additional billing as uptick revenue. In most contracts, variable consideration is comprised of uptick revenue and direct expenses. The Company bills its clients for uptick revenue upon completion of the executive search, and direct expenses are billed as incurred.\nAs required under Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, the Company now estimates uptick revenue at contract inception, based on a portfolio approach, utilizing the expected value method based on a historical analysis of uptick revenue realized in the Company's geographic regions and industry practices, and initially records a contract's uptick revenue in an amount that is probable not to result in a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized when the actual amount of uptick revenue for that contract is known. Differences between the estimated and actual amounts of variable consideration are recorded when known. The Company does not estimate revenue for direct expenses as it is not materially different than recognizing revenue as direct expenses are incurred.\nRevenue from our executive search engagement performance obligation is recognized over time as our clients simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by the Company's performance. Revenue from executive search engagements is recognized over the expected average period of performance, in proportion to the estimated personnel time incurred to fulfill our obligations under the executive search contract. Revenue is generally recognized over a period of approximately six months.\nOur executive search contracts contain a replacement guarantee which provides for an additional search to be completed, free of charge except for expense reimbursements, should the candidate presented by the Company be hired by the client and subsequently terminated by the client for performance reasons within a specified period of time. The replacement guarantee is an assurance warranty, which is not a performance obligation under the terms of the executive search contract, as the Company does not provide any services under the terms of the guarantee that transfer benefits to the client in excess of assuring that the identified candidate complies with the agreed-upon specifications. The Company accounts for the replacement guarantee under the relevant warranty guidance in ASC 460 - Guarantees.\nIn our Heidrick Consulting segment, revenue is recognized as we satisfy our performance obligations by transferring a good or service to a client. Heidrick Consulting enters into contracts with clients that outline the general terms and conditions of the assignment to provide succession planning, executive assessment, top team and board effectiveness and culture shaping programs. The consideration the Company expects to receive under each contract is generally fixed. Most of our consulting contracts contain one performance obligation, which is the overall process of providing the consulting service requested by the client. The majority of our consulting revenue is recognized over time utilizing both input and output methods. Contracts that contain coaching sessions, training sessions or the completion of assessments are recognized using the output method as each session or assessment is delivered to the client. Contracts that contain general consulting work are recognized using the input method utilizing a measure of progress that is based on time incurred on the project.\nThe Company enters into enterprise agreements with clients to provide a license for online access, via the Company's SD Connect platform, to training and other proprietary material related to the Company's culture shaping programs. The consideration the Company expects to receive under the terms of an enterprise agreement is comprised of a single fixed fee. Our enterprise agreements contain multiple performance obligations, the delivery of materials via SD Connect and material rights related to options to renew enterprise agreements at a significant discount. The Company allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract on a stand-alone selling price basis. The stand-alone selling price for the initial term of the enterprise agreement is outlined in the contract and is equal to the price paid by the client for the agreement over the initial term of the contract. The stand-alone selling price for the options to renew, or material right, are not directly observable and must be estimated. This estimate is required to reflect the discount the client would obtain when exercising the option to renew, adjusted for the likelihood that the option will be exercised. The Company estimates the likelihood of renewal using a historical analysis of client renewals. Access to SD Connect represents a right to access the Company's intellectual property that the client simultaneously receives and consumes as the Company performs under the agreement, and therefore the Company recognizes revenue over time. Given the continuous nature of this commitment, the Company utilizes straight-line ratable revenue recognition over the estimated subscription period as the Company's clients will receive and consume the benefits from SD Connect equally throughout the contract period. Revenue related to client renewals of enterprise agreements is recognized over the term of the renewal, which is generally twelve months. Enterprise agreements do not comprise a significant portion of the Company's revenue.\nEach of the Company's contracts has an expected duration of one year or less. Accordingly, the Company has elected to utilize the available practical expedient related to the disclosure of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations under its contracts. The Company has also elected the available practical expedients related to adjusting for the effects of a significant financing component and the capitalization of contract acquisition costs. The Company charges and collects from its clients, sales tax and value added taxes as required by certain jurisdictions. The Company has made an accounting policy election to exclude these items from the transaction price in its contracts.\nIncome taxes. Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate.\nThe recognition of deferred tax assets is based on management's belief that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits associated with temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits will be utilized. We assess the recoverability of the deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis. In making this assessment, we consider all positive and negative evidence, and all potential sources of taxable income including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, tax-planning strategies, projected future taxable income and recent financial performance.\nDeferred taxes have been recorded for U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes related to undistributed foreign earnings that are not permanently reinvested. Annually, we assess material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements in order to determine whether these earnings should be distributed. If so, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets. We review goodwill for impairment annually. We also review goodwill and long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value has fallen below the carrying amount of an asset. We review factors such as a significant change in business climate, attrition of key personnel, changes in financial condition or results of operations, a prolonged decline in our stock price and market capitalization, competition, and other factors to determine if an impairment test is necessary. Our annual impairment test begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a fair value based goodwill impairment test. The qualitative assessment includes evaluating whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that fair values of reporting units are greater than the carrying values. If the qualitative factors do not indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair values of the reporting units are greater than the carrying values then we perform the fair value test.\nThe Company operates four reporting units: Americas, Europe (which includes Africa), Asia Pacific (which includes the Middle East) and Heidrick Consulting. The goodwill impairment test is completed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. The fair value of each of the Company's reporting units is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology. The discounted cash flow approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of future market growth and trends, forecasted revenue and costs, capital investments, appropriate discount rates, certain assumptions to allocate shared costs, assets and liabilities, historical and projected performance of our reporting units, the outlook for the executive search industry and the macroeconomic conditions affecting each of our reporting units. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. The fair value of our reporting units is also impacted by our overall market capitalization and may be impacted by volatility in our stock price and assumed control premium, among other factors. As a result, actual future results may differ from those estimates and may result in a future impairment charge. These assumptions are updated annually, at a minimum, to reflect information concerning our reportable segments. The Company continues to monitor potential triggering events including changes in the business climate in which it operates, the Company's market capitalization compared to its book value, and the Company's recent operating performance. Any changes in these factors could result in an impairment charge. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount; however, the loss recognized is not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nAdditionally, we review long-lived assets, such as property, equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge, equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, is recognized.\nWe believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill and other intangible asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the assumptions used are highly susceptible to changes in the operating results and cash flows of our reportable segments.\nRecently Adopted Financial Accounting Standards\nIn 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income, intended to improve the usefulness of information reported as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The new guidance allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. ASU 2018-02 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company elected not to utilize the available option to reclassify stranded tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to retained earnings.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2017-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation, Scope of Modification Accounting, which is intended to provide clarity and reduce diversity in practice, cost and complexity when implementing a change in the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. ASU No. 2017-09 requires that an entity should account for the effects of a modification unless the fair value, vesting conditions and whether the award is classified as a liability instrument or an equity instrument remain unchanged in the modification. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company's financial\nstatements. The future impact of this accounting guidance will be dependent on future modification events including the number of awards modified.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Post-retirement Benefit Cost, which is intended to improve the consistency, transparency and usefulness of net benefit cost disclosures. ASU No. 2017-07 requires that an employer report the service cost component of net benefit cost in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. Additionally, the other components of net benefit costs are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company's financial statements.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash, which requires that the statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning of period and end of period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The adoption of this guidance increased the Company's beginning and ending balances of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows by approximately $0.4 million and $0.6 million, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2018. Beginning and ending balances of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows increased by approximately $0.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2017. Beginning and ending balances of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows increased by approximately $7.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which is intended to reduce diversity in practice as to how certain cash receipts and cash payments should be presented and classified. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company reclassified approximately $2.9 million of earnout payments from cash flows used in financing activities to cash flows provided by operating activities. The reclassified amount represents the amount of the earnout payement that is in excess of the earnout accrual established at the acquisition date.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments including the recognition of unrealized changes in fair value within net income. The adoption of this guidance resulted in a reclassification of accumulated unrealized gains of approximately $6.1 million from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. The impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2018, was not material. The comparative periods have not been restated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, using the modified retrospective method. The Company applied the guidance to all contracts that were not complete as of the adoption date. The guidance requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for these goods or services. The Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative periods have not been restated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. See Note 3, Revenue in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecent Financial Accounting Standards\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. The guidance requires entities that lease assets to recognize on their balance sheets the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases and to disclose key information about the leasing arrangements. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842 (Leases), which provides narrow amendments to clarify how to apply certain aspects of the new lease standard, and ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted Improvements to Topic 842 (Leases), which provides an additional, optional transition method that allows entities to initially apply the requirements by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. An entity that adopts this method must report comparative periods in accordance with current guidance (Topic 840). The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted.\nThe Company will adopt the guidance on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method without restatement of the prior periods. As such, prior periods will continue to be presented under the existing guidance in Topic 840. The Company is currently performing its evaluation of the guidance. The Company's lease portfolio is primarily comprised of office leases, which are currently classified as operating leases and will continue to be classified as operating leases under the new guidance. The adoption of the guidance will have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets with respect to recording a right-of-use asset and lease liability for each of the Company's leases. The Company will utilize the available practical expedient to not separate the non-lease components from the lease components in its office leases. The Company is currently assessing the impact of utilizing the practical expedient, however,the use of the practical expedient will increase the total lease liability. The Company does not anticipate a significant change in expense recognition as it relates to the new guidance.\nQuarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)\nThe following table sets forth certain financial information for each quarter of 2018 and 2017.

Individuals are rewarded for their performance based on a system that directly ties a portion of their compensation to the amount of net revenue for which they are responsible. A portion of the reward may be based upon individual performance against a series of non-financial measures. Credit towards the variable portion of an executive search consultant's compensation is earned by generating net revenue for winning and executing work. Each quarter, we review and update the expected annual performance of all Executive Search consultants and accrue variable compensation accordingly. The amount of variable compensation that is accrued for each Executive Search consultant is based on a tiered payout model. Overall Company performance determines the amount available for total variable compensation. The more net revenue that is generated by the consultant, the higher the percentage credited towards the consultant's variable compensation and thus accrued by our Company as expense.\nAsia Pacific\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue before reimbursements (net revenue)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>716,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>621,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>582,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reimbursements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>735,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>640,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>600,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and employee benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>506,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>434,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reimbursed expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>666,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>666,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>565,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26,523\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-operating income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>244\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,280\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net non-operating income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,895\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29,418\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(48,635\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic weighted average common shares outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic net income (loss) per common share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.60\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.83\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted net income (loss) per common share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.60\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.81\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash dividends paid per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRestructuring charges were $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

The guidance requires entities that lease assets to recognize on their balance sheets the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases and to disclose key information about the leasing arrangements. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842 (Leases), which provides narrow amendments to clarify how to apply certain aspects of the new lease standard, and ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted Improvements to Topic 842 (Leases), which provides an additional, optional transition method that allows entities to initially apply the requirements by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. An entity that adopts this method must report comparative periods in accordance with current guidance (Topic 840). The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted.\nIn 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income, intended to improve the usefulness of information reported as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The new guidance allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. ASU 2018-02 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company elected not to utilize the available option to reclassify stranded tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to retained earnings.\n\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Quarter Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Mar. 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Jun. 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sept. 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dec. 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Mar. 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Jun. 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sept. 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dec. 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue before reimbursements (net revenue)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>160,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>183,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>187,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>159,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>169,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss) (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28,411\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,772\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28,686\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,089\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for (benefit from) income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,438\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18,248\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(39,208\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic earnings (loss) per common share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.03\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.97\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.09\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings (loss) per common share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.03\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.97\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.09\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash dividends paid per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExecutive Search\nThe Heidrick Consulting segment reported net revenue of $69.4 million in 2017, a decrease of 7.6% compared to $75.0 million in 2016. The decrease in net revenue was due to a decline in the volume of client work. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted results by $1.2 million, or 1.7%. There were 64 Heidrick Consulting Partner and Principal consultants at December 31, 2017, compared to 62 at December 31, 2016.\nRestructuring charges were $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. These charges include approximately $1.8 million in severance-related charges, $0.1 million in office-related charges and $0.1 million in professional fees and other expenses.\nAsia Pacific\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Post-retirement Benefit Cost, which is intended to improve the consistency, transparency and usefulness of net benefit cost disclosures. ASU No. 2017-07 requires that an employer report the service cost component of net benefit cost in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. Additionally, the other components of net benefit costs are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company's financial statements.\nImpairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $50.7 million due to the impairment of goodwill and amortizable intangible assets associated with our Leadership Consulting and Culture Shaping reporting units. The impairment charge is recorded within Impairment charges in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2017. In 2018, the Company completed the integration of its Leadership Consulting and Culture Shaping businesses into one combined service offering, Heidrick Consulting.\nCash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2018 were $279.9 million, an increase of $72.4 million compared to $207.5 million at December 31, 2017. The $279.9 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2018 includes $112.1 million held by our foreign subsidiaries. A portion of the $112.1 million is considered permanently reinvested in these foreign subsidiaries. If these funds were required to satisfy obligations in the United States, the repatriation of these funds could cause us to incur additional foreign withholding taxes. We expect to pay approximately $202.0 million in variable compensation related to 2018 performance in March and April 2019. In January 2019, we paid approximately $14.0 million in variable compensation that was deferred in prior years.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, the results of operations (in thousands, except per share data):\nWe pay the non-deferred portion of annual bonuses in the first quarter following the year in which they are earned. Employee bonuses are accrued throughout the year and are based on our performance and the performance of the individual employee.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. Consolidated general and administrative expenses increased $0.2 million, or 0.2%, to $147.3 million in 2017 from $147.1 million in 2016. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations positively impacted general and administrative expenses by $0.8 million, or 0.5%.\nGlobal Operations Support\nAs a percentage of net revenue, salaries and employee benefits expense was 69.9% in 2017, compared to 68.7% in 2016.\nAsia Pacific reported net revenue of $102.3 million in 2018, an increase of 17.7% compared to $86.9 million in 2017. The increase in net revenue was due to a 5.5% increase in the number of executive search confirmations and an increase in average revenue per executive search. The net impact of the new revenue recognition standard increased revenue by approximately $3.0 million. All industry practice groups contributed to the increase in net revenue, with the exception of the Education and Social Enterprises practice group. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted net revenue by $0.7 million, or 0.7%. There were 73 Partner and Principal consultants as of December 31, 2018, compared to 80 as of December 31, 2017.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense increased $15.7 million from 2016. Fixed compensation increased $7.0 million primarily due to compensation expense associated with the JCA Group acquisition in August 2016, increases in legacy base salaries and payroll taxes and the HMRC employee benefit tax settlement, net of reimbursements. Variable compensation increased $8.7 million due to higher bonus accruals for consultant performance.\nWe are currently forecasting 2019 first quarter net revenue of between $165 million and $175 million. Our 2019 first quarter guidance is based upon, among other things, management's assumptions for the anticipated volume of new executive search confirmations and leadership consulting and culture shaping projects, the current backlog, consultant productivity, consultant retention, the seasonality of our business and average currency rates from December 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $2.9 million from 2016 primarily due to decreases in intangible amortization and accretion as a result of current year impairments, litigation expense and professional fees, partially offset by increases in office occupancy and the use of external third-party consultants to complete client work.\nAsia Pacific reported net revenue of $86.9 million in 2017, an increase of 1.9% compared to $85.3 million in 2016. The Life Sciences, Industrial, and Financial Services practice groups contributed to the increase in net revenue. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations positively impacted results by $0.4 million, or 0.4%. The number of consultants was 80 as of December 31, 2017, compared to 82 as of December 31, 2016.\nFactors that may affect the outcome of the forward-looking statements include, among other things, leadership changes, our ability to attract, integrate, develop, manage and retain qualified consultants and senior leaders; our ability to prevent our consultants from taking our clients with them to another firm; our ability to maintain our professional reputation and brand name; the fact that our net revenue may be affected by adverse economic conditions; our clients' ability to restrict us from recruiting their employees; the aggressive competition we face; our heavy reliance on information management systems; the fact that we face the risk of liability in the services we perform; the fact that data security, data privacy and data protection laws and other evolving regulations and cross-border data transfer restrictions may limit the use of our services and adversely affect our business; social, political, regulatory and legal risks in markets where we operate; the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; the fact that we may not be able to align our cost structure with net revenue; unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings; our ability to realize our tax losses; the timing of the establishment or reversal of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets; any impairment of our goodwill, other intangible assets and other long-lived assets; our ability to execute and integrate future acquisitions; the fact that we have anti-takeover provisions that make an acquisition of us difficult and expensive; our ability to access additional credit; and the increased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks that could pose a risk to our systems, networks, solutions, services and data. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nIn 2017, we had an average of 1,798 employees, compared to an average of 1,716 employees in 2016.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, using the modified retrospective method. The Company applied the guidance to all contracts that were not complete as of the adoption date. The guidance requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for these goods or services. The Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative periods have not been restated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. See Note 3, Revenue in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n2018 Overview\nRecently Adopted Financial Accounting Standards\nOther, net was expense of $3.3 million in 2017 compared to income of $2.3 million in 2016. Other, net results declined primarily due to the HMRC employee benefit tax settlement of $2.4 million.\nRestructuring charges. During the fourth quarter 2017, the Company announced a restructuring plan to reduce overall costs and improve efficiencies in its operations. As a result of this plan, the Company incurred approximately $15.7 million in restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2017. These charges included approximately $13.1 million in severance-related charges, $2.3 million in professional fees and other expenses, and $0.3 million in office-related charges. There were no similar restructuring charges in 2018.\nThe following table sets forth certain financial information for each quarter of 2018 and 2017. The information is derived from our quarterly consolidated financial statements which are unaudited but which, in the opinion of management, have been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual consolidated financial statements included in this document. The consolidated financial data shown below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period.\nOperating income as a percentage of net revenue was 9.6% in 2018, compared to an operating loss margin of 4.3% in 2017. The change in operating income was primarily due to an increase in net revenue of $94.6 million and the impact of impairment\nBefore October 26, 2018, the Company was party to its Restated Credit Agreement, which was executed on June 30, 2015. The Restated Credit Agreement provided a single senior unsecured revolving line of credit with an aggregate commitment of up to $100 million, which included a sublimit of $25 million for letters of credit, and a $50 million expansion feature. Borrowings under the Restated Credit Agreement bore interest at the Company's election of the existing Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Restated Credit Agreement) or the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (as defined in the Restated Credit Agreement) plus a spread as determined by the Company's leverage ratio.\nDeferred taxes have been recorded for U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes related to undistributed foreign earnings that are not permanently reinvested. Annually, we assess material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements in order to determine whether these earnings should be distributed. If so, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate.\nLines of Credit. On October 26, 2018, the Company entered into a new Credit Agreement (the \"2018 Credit Agreement\") to replace the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"Restated Credit Agreement\") executed on June 30, 2015. The 2018 Credit Agreement provides the Company with a senior unsecured revolving line of credit with an aggregate commitment of $175 million, which includes a sublimit of $25 million for letters of credit, and a $10 million swingline loan sublimit. The agreement also includes a $75 million expansion feature. The 2018 Credit Agreement will mature in October 2023. Borrowings under the 2018 Credit Agreement bear interest at the Company's election of the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the 2018 Credit Agreement) or Adjusted LIBOR (as defined in the 2018 Credit Agreement) plus a spread as determined by the Company's leverage ratio.\nOperating income. Our consolidated operating income was $68.9 million in 2018, compared to a loss of $26.5 million, including impairment charges of $50.7 million and restructuring charges of $15.7 million in 2017. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations positively impacted operating income by $0.8 million or 1.2%. Excluding the impact of impairment and restructuring charges in 2017, operating income increased $29.0 million from $39.7 million to $68.9 million.\nAt the Heidrick Consulting consultant level, there are also fixed and variable components of compensation. Overall compensation is determined based on the total economic contribution of the Heidrick Consulting segment to the business as a whole. Individual consultant compensation can vary, and is derived from credits earned for delivering client work plus credits earned for contributions of intellectual and human capital, client relationship development and consulting practice development. Each quarter, we review and update the expected annual performance of all Heidrick Consulting consultants and accrue variable compensation accordingly.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company borrowed $20 million under the Restated Credit Agreement and elected the Adjusted LIBOR Rate. The Company subsequently repaid $8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and $12 million during the three months ended June 30, 2018.\nThe number of Executive Search and Heidrick Consulting consultants was 353 and 66, respectively, as of December 31, 2018, compared to 346 and 64, respectively, as of December 31, 2017. Specific to Executive Search, which is our largest business, productivity as measured by annualized net Executive Search revenue per consultant was $1.9 million and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The number of confirmed searches increased 11.8%, compared to 2017. The average revenue per executive search increased to $127,300 in 2018 compared to $120,300 in 2017.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense increased $14.5 million, or 15.9%, from 2017. Fixed compensation increased $5.7 million primarily due increases in base salaries and payroll taxes and retirement and benefits, partially offset by a decrease in separation costs. Base salaries, payroll taxes, and retirement and benefits increased due to additional headcount as a result of the Amrop acquisition. Variable compensation increased $8.8 million due to higher bonus accruals for consultant performance. The impact of the new revenue recognition standard increased salaries and benefits expense by approximately $0.7 million.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $1.0 million, or 2.0%, from 2017 primarily due to a decrease in communications, bad debt, and office occupancy, partially offset by increases in professional services, and internal travel.\n2019 Outlook\nThe Americas segment reported net revenue of $339.8 million in 2017, an increase of 8.5% from $313.3 million in 2016. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 5.7% increase in the number of executive search confirmations compared to the prior year as well as an increase in consultant headcount. All industry practice groups contributed to the increased net revenue. The number of consultants was 163 as of December 31, 2017, compared to 158 as of December 31, 2016.\nNet interest income was $1.1 million in 2018, a $0.7 million increase from net interest income of $0.4 million in 2017.\nAmericas\nThe Heidrick Consulting segment reported an operating loss of $62.4 million in 2017, a decrease of $57.0 million compared to an operating loss of $5.3 million in 2016. The increased operating loss primarily reflects $50.7 million of impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets, as well as restructuring charges of $3.4 million. Excluding the impact of impairment and restructuring charges, the Heidrick Consulting segment reported an operating loss of $8.4 million.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense increased $5.2 million, or 8.6% from 2017. Fixed compensation decreased by $0.7 million due to decreases in base salaries and payroll taxes and retirement and benefits, partially offset by an increase in talent acquisition and retention costs. Variable compensation increased $5.9 million due to higher bonus accruals for consultant performance. The impact of the new revenue recognition standard increased salaries and benefits expense by approximately $2.1 million.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations as well as other sections of this annual report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but instead represent only our beliefs, assumptions, expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside our control. These statements include statements other than historical information or statements of current condition and may relate to our future plans and objectives and results. By identifying these statements for you in this manner, we are alerting you to the possibility that our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, those discussed under the Section heading Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nOur Business\n\nContractual obligations. The following table presents our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018, and the expected timing of cash payments related to these contractual obligations (in millions):\nstatements. The future impact of this accounting guidance will be dependent on future modification events including the number of awards modified.\nWe ended the year with combined cash and cash equivalents of $279.9 million, an increase of $72.3 million compared to $207.5 million at December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to the strong cash inflows from operations partially offset by acquisition spend, restructuring payments and larger bonus payments year over year. We pay the majority of bonuses in the first quarter following the year in which they were earned. Employee bonuses are accrued throughout the year and are based on the Company's performance and the performance of the individual employee. We expect to pay approximately $202.0 million in bonuses related to 2018 performance in March and April 2019. In January 2019, we paid approximately $14.0 million in cash bonuses deferred in prior years.\nexchange fluctuations negatively impacted net revenue by $0.7 million, or 0.2%. There were 179 Partner and Principal consultants as of December 31, 2018, compared to 163 as of December 31, 2017.\nIn 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $67.0 million, principally reflecting net income net of non-cash charges of $21.1 million, an increase in accrued expenses of $18.3 million and a restructuring accrual of $13.0 million. The increase in accrued expenses primarily reflects approximately $148 million of current year bonus accruals, partially offset by $128 million of bonus payments for 2016 made in early 2017.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $3.2 million primarily due to increases in professional fees and office occupancy, partially offset by a decrease in hiring fees and temporary labor.\nRestructuring charges were $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. These charges included approximately $0.6 million in severance-related charges and $0.2 million in professional fees and other expenses.\nRevenue recognition. In our Executive Search segment, revenue is recognized as we satisfy our performance obligations by transferring a good or service to a client. Generally, each of our executive search contracts contain one performance obligation which is the process of identifying potentially qualified candidates for a specific client position. In most contracts, the transaction price includes both fixed and variable consideration. Fixed compensation is comprised of a retainer, equal to approximately one-third of the estimated first year compensation for the position to be filled, and indirect expenses, equal to a specified percentage of the retainer, as defined in the contract. The Company generally bills its clients for its retainer and indirect expenses in one-third increments over a three-month period commencing in the month of a client's acceptance of the contract. If actual compensation of a placed candidate exceeds the original compensation estimate, the Company is often authorized to bill the client for one-third of the excess compensation. The Company refers to this additional billing as uptick revenue. In most contracts, variable consideration is comprised of uptick revenue and direct expenses. The Company bills its clients for uptick revenue upon completion of the executive search, and direct expenses are billed as incurred.\nSalaries and employee benefits. Consolidated salaries and employee benefits expense increased $72.1 million, or 16.6%, to $506.3 million in 2018 from $434.2 million in 2017. The increase was due to higher fixed compensation of $24.9 million and\nHeidrick Consulting\nWe manage and assess our performance through various means, with primary financial and operational measures including net revenue, operating income, operating margin, Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) and Adjusted EBITDA margin (non-GAAP).\nThe Heidrick Consulting segment reported an operating loss of $13.6 million in 2018, an increase of $48.7 million, compared to an operating loss of $62.4 million in 2017. Excluding the impact of impairment and restructuring charges in 2017, operating loss decreased $5.4 million from a loss of $8.3 million to a loss of $13.6 million.\nWe are a leadership advisory firm providing executive search and consulting services. We help our clients build leadership teams by facilitating the recruitment, management and development of senior executives. We believe focusing on top-level services offers us several advantages that include access to and influence with key decision makers, increased potential for recurring search consulting engagements, higher fees per search, enhanced brand visibility and a leveraged global footprint, which create added barriers to entry for potential competitors. Working at the top of client organizations also allows us to attract and retain high-caliber consultants.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments including the recognition of unrealized changes in fair value within net income. The adoption of this guidance resulted in a reclassification of accumulated unrealized gains of approximately $6.1 million from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. The impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2018, was not material. The comparative periods have not been restated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.\nOperating income was $75.3 million in 2017, an increase of $3.3 million compared to $72.0 million in 2016. Excluding the impact of restructuring charges, the Americas segment reported operating income of $76.1 million.\nQuarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)\nAmericas\nTotal revenue. Consolidated total revenue increased $39.2 million, or 6.5%, to $640.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $600.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in total revenue was primarily due to the increase in revenue before reimbursements (net revenue).\nOn February 11, 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase shares of our common stock with an aggregate total amount up to $50 million. We intend from time to time and as business conditions warrant to purchase shares of our common stock on the open market or in negotiated or block trades. No time limit has been set for completion of this program. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in 2018. The most recent purchase of shares of common stock occurred during the year ended December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2018, we have purchased 1,038,670 shares of our common stock for a total of $28.3 million and $21.7 million remains available for future purchases under the authorization. Unless terminated or extended earlier by resolution of the Board of Directors, the program will expire when the amount authorized for repurchases has been spent.\nIncome taxes. Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate.\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, there are different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur periodically, that could materially impact the financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nNote: Totals and subtotals may not equal the sum of individual line items due to rounding.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. Consolidated general and administrative expenses decreased $6.5 million, or 4.4%, to $140.8 million in 2018 from $147.3 million in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the use of external third-party consultants by Heidrick Consulting, lower expenses associated with global partner meetings, lower intangible amortization due to intangible asset impairment in the prior year, and bad debt expense, partially offset by increases in professional fees and office occupancy. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted general and administrative expenses by $0.8 million, or 0.6%.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which is intended to reduce diversity in practice as to how certain cash receipts and cash payments should be presented and classified. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company reclassified approximately $2.9 million of earnout payments from cash flows used in financing activities to cash flows provided by operating activities. The reclassified amount represents the amount of the earnout payement that is in excess of the earnout accrual established at the acquisition date.\nA portion of our Executive Search consultants' and management cash bonuses is deferred and paid over a three-year vesting period. The compensation expense related to the amounts being deferred is recognized on a graded vesting attribution method over the requisite service period. This service period begins on January 1 of the respective fiscal year and continues through the deferral date, which coincides with our bonus payments in the first quarter of the following year, and for an additional three year vesting period. The deferrals are recorded in Accrued salaries and employee benefits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense increased $45.7 million, or 21.1%, from 2017. Fixed compensation increased $14.6 million primarily due to talent acquisition and retention costs, stock compensation, and retirement and benefits, partially offset by a decrease in the deferred compensation plan due to market fluctuations. Variable compensation increased $31.1 million primarily due to higher bonus accruals for consultant performance. The impact of the new revenue recognition standard increased salaries and benefits expense by approximately $2.9 million.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $3.7 million, or 12.1% from 2017 primarily due to ongoing general and administrative expenses related to the Amrop acquisition, professional fees, and office occupancy.\nCash used in investing activities was $35.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the acquisitions of JCA Group, DSI and Philosophy IB, capital expenditures of $5.3 million and the purchase of available for sale securities of $2.5 million.\nRestructuring charges were $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. These charges included approximately $0.6 million in severance-related charges and $0.2 million in professional fees and other expenses.\n (1) Operating income for the Americas includes $0.8 million of restructuring charges in 2017. \nGlobal Operations Support expenses in 2017 decreased $1.3 million, or 3.1%, to $40.0 million from $41.3 million in 2016.\nGeneral. We continually evaluate our liquidity requirements, capital needs and availability of capital resources based on our operating needs. We believe that our available cash balances together with the funds expected to be generated from operations and funds available under our committed revolving credit facility will be sufficient to finance our operations for the foreseeable future, as well as to finance the cash payments associated with our cash dividends and stock repurchase program.\nRecent Financial Accounting Standards\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under either the 2018 Credit Agreement or the Restated Credit Agreement. The Company was in compliance with the financial and other covenants under both facilities and no event of default existed.\nIn addition to executive search, we provide consulting services including executive leadership assessment, leadership, team and board development, succession planning, talent strategy, people performance, inter-team collaboration, culture shaping and organizational transformation.\nExecutive Overview\nThe recognition of deferred tax assets is based on management's belief that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits associated with temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits will be utilized. We assess the recoverability of the deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis. In making this assessment, we consider all positive and negative evidence, and all potential sources of taxable income including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, tax-planning strategies, projected future taxable income and recent financial performance.\nIn addition to the contractual obligations included in the above table, we have liabilities related to certain employee benefit plans. These liabilities are recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018. The obligations related to these employee benefit plans are described in Note 12, Employee Benefit Plans, and Note 13, Pension Plan and Life Insurance Contract, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As the timing of cash disbursements related to these employee benefit plans is uncertain, we have not included these obligations in the above table. The table excludes our liability for uncertain tax positions including accrued interest and penalties, which totaled $1.5 million as of December 31, 2018, since we cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities.\nOther, net was income of $0.5 million in 2018, compared to expense of $3.3 million in 2017. Other, net results improved primarily due to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (\"HMRC\") employee benefit tax settlement of $2.4 million in 2017, as well as the positive impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $1.2 million.\nExecutive Search and Heidrick Consulting performance is also measured using consultant headcount. Specific to Executive Search, confirmation trends, consultant productivity and average revenue per search are used to measure performance.\nRevenue from our executive search engagement performance obligation is recognized over time as our clients simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by the Company's performance. Revenue from executive search engagements is recognized over the expected average period of performance, in proportion to the estimated personnel time incurred to fulfill our obligations under the executive search contract. Revenue is generally recognized over a period of approximately six months.\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $1.2 million due to decreases in internal travel, professional fees, hiring fees and communications services, partially offset by an increase in office occupancy.\nThe number of consultants, confirmation trends, number of searches or projects completed, productivity levels and the average revenue per search or project will vary from quarter to quarter, affecting net revenue and operating margin.\nWe believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill and other intangible asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the assumptions used are highly susceptible to changes in the operating results and cash flows of our reportable segments.\nYear ended December 31, 2018 compared to year ended December 31, 2017\nCash flows used in investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to capital expenditures of $6.0 million, the acquisition of Amrop for $3.1 million and purchases of available for sale securities of $2.2 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities of $3.0 million. The increase in capital expenditures is primarily the result of office build-outs and a global information technology update.\nOperating income. Our consolidated operating income was a loss of $26.5 million in 2017, compared to income of $35.2 million in 2016. The operating loss was primarily due to $50.7 million in impairment charges as well as $15.7 million in restructuring charges. Excluding impairment and restructuring charges, the Company reported operating income of $39.9 million. Exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted operating income by $0.2 million, or 0.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nEurope reported net revenue of $145.3 million in 2018, an increase of 16.0% from $125.3 million in 2017. The increase in net revenue was due to a 13.1% increase in the number of executive search confirmations compared to the prior year and the Amrop acquisition. The net impact of the new revenue recognition standard increased revenue by approximately $1.0 million. All industry practice groups contributed to net revenue growth. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations positively impacted net revenue by $4.7 million, or 3.3%. There were 101 Partner and Principal consultants as of December 31, 2018, compared to 103 as of December 31, 2017.\nCash used in financing activities in 2017 was $17.1 million due to cash dividend payments of $10.1 million, earnout payments related to the Co Company and Scambler MacGregor acquisitions of $4.6 million and the payment of employee tax withholdings on equity transactions of $2.4 million. Gross proceeds and payments on the Company's line of credit were each $40.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIncome taxes. See Note 17, Income Taxes.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2017-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation, Scope of Modification Accounting, which is intended to provide clarity and reduce diversity in practice, cost and complexity when implementing a change in the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. ASU No. 2017-09 requires that an entity should account for the effects of a modification unless the fair value, vesting conditions and whether the award is classified as a liability instrument or an equity instrument remain unchanged in the modification. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company's financial\nThe Asia Pacific segment reported operating income of $0.5 million in 2017, a decrease of $3.4 million compared to $3.9 million in 2016. Excluding the impact of restructuring charges, the Asia Pacific segment reported operating income of $2.6 million.\nRestructuring charges were $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. These charges included approximately $1.8 million in severance-related charges, $0.1 million in office-related charges and $0.1 million in professional fees and other expenses.\nWe operate our Executive Search business in the Americas, Europe (which includes Africa) and Asia Pacific (which includes the Middle East), and we operate our Heidrick Consulting business globally (See Note 18, Segment Information).\nRevenue before reimbursements (net revenue). Consolidated net revenue increased $39.0 million or 6.7%, to $621.4 million in 2017, from $582.4 million in 2016. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted results by $1.4 million, or 0.2%. Executive Search net revenue was $552.0 million in 2017, an increase of $44.7 million from 2016. The increase in Executive Search net revenue was the result of growth in the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. Heidrick Consulting net revenue decreased $5.7 million, or 7.6%, to $69.4 million in 2017 from $75.0 million in 2016.\nGeneral. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3, Revenue, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. If actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known.\nCash used in investing activities was $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to capital expenditures of $14.0 million and purchases of available for sale securities of $2.3 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities of $1.4 million. The increase in capital expenditures is primarily the result of office build-outs and a global information technology update.\nCash used in financing activities in 2016 was $17.2 million due to cash dividend payments of $10.0 million, earnout payments for the Senn Delaney, Scambler MacGregor and Co Company acquisitions of $4.6 million, and the payment of employee tax withholdings on equity transactions of $2.7 million.\nRestructuring charges. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company announced a restructuring plan to reduce overall costs and improve efficiencies in its operations. As a result of this plan, the Company incurred approximately $15.7 million in restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2017. These charges included approximately $13.1 million in severance-related charges, $2.3 million in professional fees and other expenses and $0.3 million in office-related charges. There were no similar restructuring charges in 2016.\n\nHeidrick Consulting\nThe Americas segment reported net revenue of $405.3 million in 2018, an increase of 19.3% from $339.8 million in 2017. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 14.4% increase in the number of executive search confirmations, compared to the prior year, as well as an increase in average revenue per executive search. The net impact of the new revenue recognition standard increased revenue by approximately $4.1 million. All industry practice groups contributed to the increased net revenue. Foreign\nBorrowings under the 2018 Credit Agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, Permitted Acquisitions (as defined in the 2018 Credit Agreement) and for other general purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries. The obligations under the 2018 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of the Company's subsidiaries.\n (1) Includes impairment charges of $50.7 million related to Heidrick Consulting in 2017. \nAs a percentage of net revenue, general and administrative expenses were 23.7% in 2017, compared to 25.3% in 2016.\n(1) Represents the fair value of the obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets primarily related to our obligation at the end of the lease term to return office space to the landlord in its original condition.\nThe Asia Pacific segment reported operating income of $16.0 million in 2018, an increase of $15.5 million compared to $0.5 million in 2017. Excluding the impact of restructuring charges in 2017, operating income increased $13.4 million from $2.6 million to $16.0 million.\nRestructuring charges were $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. These charges included approximately $3.9 million in severance-related charges and $0.1 million in in office-related charges.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOff-balance sheet arrangements. We do not have material off-balance sheet arrangements, special purpose entities, trading activities of non-exchange traded contracts or transactions with related parties.\nOperating income was $96.9 million in 2018, an increase of $21.5 million, compared to $75.3 million in 2017. Excluding the impact of restructuring charges in 2017, operating income increased $20.8 million from $76.1 million in 2017 to $96.9 million in 2018.\nThe Company capitalized approximately $1.0 million of loan acquisition costs related to the 2018 Credit Agreement, which will be amortized over the remaining term of the agreement.\nEurope\nAs required under Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, the Company now estimates uptick revenue at contract inception, based on a portfolio approach, utilizing the expected value method based on a historical analysis of uptick revenue realized in the Company's geographic regions and industry practices, and initially records a contract's uptick revenue in an amount that is probable not to result in a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized when the actual amount of uptick revenue for that contract is known. Differences between the estimated and actual amounts of variable consideration are recorded when known. The Company does not estimate revenue for direct expenses as it is not materially different than recognizing revenue as direct expenses are incurred.\nThe number of Executive Search and Heidrick Consulting consultants was 346 and 64, respectively, as of December 31, 2017 compared to 335 and 62, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. Specific to Executive Search, productivity as measured by annualized net Executive Search revenue per consultant was $1.6 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The number of confirmed searches increased 4.5%, compared to 2016. The average revenue per executive search increased to $120,300 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $117,700 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGlobal Operations Support expenses decreased $3.8 million, or 9.5%, to $36.3 million from $40.0 million in 2017.\nOur Compensation Model\nAdditionally, we review long-lived assets, such as property, equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge, equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, is recognized.\nIncome taxes. See Note 17, Income Taxes.\nRevenue is driven by market conditions and a combination of the number of executive search engagements and leadership consulting and culture shaping projects and the average revenue per search or project. With the exception of compensation expense, incremental increases in revenue do not necessarily result in proportionate increases in costs, particularly operating and administrative expenses, thus creating the potential to improve operating margins.\nAs a percentage of net revenue, salaries and employee benefits expense was 70.7% in 2018, compared to 69.9% in 2017.\nRestructuring charges were $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. These charges included approximately $2.1 million in severance-related charges, $1.2 million in professional fees and other expenses and $0.1 million in office-related charges.\nThe following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, our results of operations as a percentage of revenue before reimbursements (net revenue):\nRestructuring charges were $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. These charges included approximately $3.9 million in severance-related charges and $0.1 million in office-related charges.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $2.8 million from 2016 primarily due to ongoing general and administrative expenses related to the JCA Group acquisition including increases in amortization and accretion and professional services.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets. We review goodwill for impairment annually. We also review goodwill and long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value has fallen below the carrying amount of an asset. We review factors such as a significant change in business climate, attrition of key personnel, changes in financial condition or results of operations, a prolonged decline in our stock price and market capitalization, competition, and other factors to determine if an impairment test is necessary. Our annual impairment test begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a fair value based goodwill impairment test. The qualitative assessment includes evaluating whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that fair values of reporting units are greater than the carrying values. If the qualitative factors do not indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair values of the reporting units are greater than the carrying values then we perform the fair value test.\ncharges and restructuring charges of $50.7 and $15.6 million, respectively, in 2017, partially offset by an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense of $72.1 million. Salaries and employee benefits expense as a percentage of net revenue was 70.7% in 2018 and 69.9% in 2017. General and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue was 19.7% in 2018 and 23.7% in 2017.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense increased $0.2 million from 2016. Fixed compensation increased $1.0 million primarily due to the acquisitions of Decision Strategies International, Inc.

Variable compensation decreased $0.7 million due to lower bonus accruals for consultant performance. The impact of the new revenue recognition standard decreased salaries and benefits expense by approximately $2.7 million.\nEurope\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company borrowed $40 million under the Restated Credit Agreement and elected the Adjusted LIBOR rate. The Company subsequently repaid $15 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and $25 million during the three months ended June 30, 2017.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $4.8 million, or 16.7%, from 2017 primarily as a result of decreases in the use of external third-party consultants and intangible amortization as a result of impairment in the prior year, partially offset by an increase in professional services.\nCash flows used in financing activities. Cash used in financing activities in 2018 was $17.0 million due to cash dividend payments of $10.2 million, earnout payments related to the JCA Group acquisitions of $3.6 million and the payment of employee tax withholdings on equity transactions of $2.2 million.

Heidrick Consulting enters into contracts with clients that outline the general terms and conditions of the assignment to provide succession planning, executive assessment, top team and board effectiveness and culture shaping programs. The consideration the Company expects to receive under each contract is generally fixed. Most of our consulting contracts contain one performance obligation, which is the overall process of providing the consulting service requested by the client. The majority of our consulting revenue is recognized over time utilizing both input and output methods. Contracts that contain coaching sessions, training sessions or the completion of assessments are recognized using the output method as each session or assessment is delivered to the client. Contracts that contain general consulting work are recognized using the input method utilizing a measure of progress that is based on time incurred on the project.\nThe Company will adopt the guidance on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method without restatement of the prior periods. As such, prior periods will continue to be presented under the existing guidance in Topic 840. The Company is currently performing its evaluation of the guidance. The Company's lease portfolio is primarily comprised of office leases, which are currently classified as operating leases and will continue to be classified as operating leases under the new guidance. The adoption of the guidance will have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets with respect to recording a right-of-use asset and lease liability for each of the Company's leases. The Company will utilize the available practical expedient to not separate the non-lease components from the lease components in its office leases. The Company is currently assessing the impact of utilizing the practical expedient, however,the use of the practical expedient will increase the total lease liability. The Company does not anticipate a significant change in expense recognition as it relates to the new guidance.\n (3) Operating income for Asia Pacific includes $2.0 million of restructuring charges in 2017. \nThe Company operates four reporting units: Americas, Europe (which includes Africa), Asia Pacific (which includes the Middle East) and Heidrick Consulting. The goodwill impairment test is completed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. The fair value of each of the Company's reporting units is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology. The discounted cash flow approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of future market growth and trends, forecasted revenue and costs, capital investments, appropriate discount rates, certain assumptions to allocate shared costs, assets and liabilities, historical and projected performance of our reporting units, the outlook for the executive search industry and the macroeconomic conditions affecting each of our reporting units. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. The fair value of our reporting units is also impacted by our overall market capitalization and may be impacted by volatility in our stock price and assumed control premium, among other factors. As a result, actual future results may differ from those estimates and may result in a future impairment charge. These assumptions are updated annually, at a minimum, to reflect information concerning our reportable segments. The Company continues to monitor potential triggering events including changes in the business climate in which it operates, the Company's market capitalization compared to its book value, and the Company's recent operating performance. Any changes in these factors could result in an impairment charge. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount; however, the loss recognized is not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nhigher variable compensation of $47.2 million. Fixed compensation increased due to talent acquisition and retention costs, stock compensation, base salaries and payroll taxes, and retirement and benefits, partially offset by a decline in the deferred compensation plan due to market fluctuations. Our acquisition of Amrop in January 2018 contributed to the increase in base salaries and payroll taxes and retirement and benefits. Variable compensation increased due to increased production over the prior year. The impact of the new revenue recognition standard increased salaries and benefits expense by approximately $3.0 million. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted salaries and employee benefits expenses by $2.4 million, or 0.5%.\nImpairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $50.7 million due to the impairment of goodwill and amortizable intangible assets associated with our Leadership Consulting and Culture Shaping reporting units. The impairment charge is recorded within Impairment charges in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2017. In 2018, the Company completed the integration of its Leadership Consulting and Culture Shaping businesses into one combined service offering, Heidrick Consulting.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016\nSalaries and employee benefits expense increased $3.1 million from 2016. Fixed compensation remained consistent with the prior year due to decreases in base salaries and payroll taxes and minimum guarantee and sign-on bonus amortization, offset by increases in retirement and benefits and stock compensation. Variable compensation increased $3.1 million due to higher bonus accruals for consultant performance.\nOur executive search contracts contain a replacement guarantee which provides for an additional search to be completed, free of charge except for expense reimbursements, should the candidate presented by the Company be hired by the client and subsequently terminated by the client for performance reasons within a specified period of time. The replacement guarantee is an assurance warranty, which is not a performance obligation under the terms of the executive search contract, as the Company does not provide any services under the terms of the guarantee that transfer benefits to the client in excess of assuring that the identified candidate complies with the agreed-upon specifications. The Company accounts for the replacement guarantee under the relevant warranty guidance in ASC 460 - Guarantees.\nCash flows provided by operating activities. In 2018, cash provided by operating activities was $102.9 million, principally reflecting net income net of non-cash charges of $68.6 million, an increase in accrued expenses of $71.5 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $16.8 million and restructuring payments of $11.6 million. The increase in accrued expenses primarily reflects approximately $202.0 million of current year bonus accruals, partially offset by $148.0 million of bonus payments for 2017 made in early 2018.\nSalaries and employee benefits. Consolidated salaries and employee benefits expense increased $34.1 million, or 8.5%, to $434.2 million in 2017 from $400.1 million in 2016. The increase was due to higher variable compensation of $23.2 million and higher fixed compensation of $10.9 million. Fixed compensation increased due to higher average headcount due to recent acquisitions, new hires over the last year and the HMRC employee benefit tax settlement of $1.5 million. Variable compensation increased due to increased production over the prior year. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations positively impacted salaries and benefits expense by $0.4 million, or 0.1%.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash, which requires that the statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning of period and end of period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The adoption of this guidance increased the Company's beginning and ending balances of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows by approximately $0.4 million and $0.6 million, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2018. Beginning and ending balances of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows increased by approximately $0.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2017. Beginning and ending balances of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows increased by approximately $7.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nWe provide our services to a broad range of clients through the expertise of over 400 consultants located in major cities around the world. Our executive search services are provided on a retained basis. Revenue before reimbursements of out-of-pocket expenses ( net revenue\u201d) consists of retainers and indirect expenses billed to clients. Typically, we are paid a retainer for our executive search services equal to approximately one-third of the estimated first-year compensation for the position to be filled. In addition, if the actual compensation of a placed candidate exceeds the estimated compensation, we often are authorized to bill the client for one-third of the excess. Indirect expenses are calculated as a percentage of the retainer with certain dollar limits per search.\nThe Heidrick Consulting segment reported net revenue of $63.1 million in 2018, a decrease of 9.0% compared to $69.4 million in 2017. The decline in revenue was primarily the result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard and its $3.8 million negative impact on revenue associated with enterprise agreements. Enterprise agreements are now recognized over a longer term due to certain renewal options included in the contract. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations positively impacted results by $0.7 million, or 1.1%. There were 66 Heidrick Consulting Partner and Principal consultants as of December 31, 2018, compared to 64 as of December 31, 2017.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nEach of the Company's contracts has an expected duration of one year or less. Accordingly, the Company has elected to utilize the available practical expedient related to the disclosure of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations under its contracts. The Company has also elected the available practical expedients related to adjusting for the effects of a significant financing component and the capitalization of contract acquisition costs. The Company charges and collects from its clients, sales tax and value added taxes as required by certain jurisdictions. The Company has made an accounting policy election to exclude these items from the transaction price in its contracts.\nRevenue before reimbursements (net revenue). Consolidated net revenue increased $94.6 million, or 15.2%, to $716.0 million in 2018 from $621.4 million in 2017. Foreign exchange rates positively impacted results by $4.0 million, or 0.6%. Executive Search net revenue was $652.9 million in 2018, an increase of $100.8 million compared to 2017. The increase in Executive Search net revenue was the result of growth in the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Our acquisition of Amrop in January 2018 also contributed to the growth in Executive Search net revenue. The net impact of the new revenue recognition standard increased Executive Search net revenue by approximately $8.0 million. Heidrick Consulting net revenue decreased $6.2 million, or 9.0%, to $63.1 million in 2018 from $69.4 million in 2017. Heidrick Consulting net revenue declined by approximately $3.8 million due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard and its impact on revenue associated with enterprise agreements.\nNet interest income was $0.4 million in 2017, a $0.2 million increase from net interest income of $0.2 million in 2016.\nImpairment charges. In 2017, the Company determined that the goodwill and intangible assets within the Culture Shaping and Leadership Consulting reporting units were impaired, which resulted in impairment charges of $39.2 million and $11.6 million, respectively, to write off all the goodwill and intangible assets associated with each of the reporting units. The impairments were non-cash in nature and did not affect our current liquidity, cash flows, borrowing capability or operations, nor did they impact the debt covenants under our credit agreement. The impairment charges are recorded within Impairment charges in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. In 2018, the Company completed the integration of its Leadership Consulting and Culture Shaping businesses into one combined service offering, Heidrick Consulting.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $3.3 million, or 13.6% from 2017 primarily due to decreases in bad debt, internal travel and office occupancy.\n(1) Includes $39.2 million of goodwill and intangible asset impairment for the three months ended June 30, 2017. Includes $11.6 million of goodwill and intangible asset impairment and $15.6 million of restructuring charges for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nThe mix of individual consultants who generate revenue in Executive Search and economic contributions in Heidrick Consulting can significantly affect the total amount of compensation expense recorded, which directly impacts operating margin. As a result, the variable portion of the compensation expense may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. The total variable compensation is discretionary, and is based on Company-wide financial targets approved by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.\nNet non-operating income (expense). Net non-operating income was $1.6 million in 2018, compared to expense of $2.9 million in 2017.\nEurope reported net revenue of $125.3 million in 2017, an increase of 15.3% from $108.8 million in 2016. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 6.2% increase in the number of executive search confirmations compared to the prior year and an increase in consultant headcount. Our acquisition of JCA Group Limited (\"JCA Group\") in August 2016 also contributed to the year-over-year growth in net revenue. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted results by $1.0 million, or 0.8%. All industry practice groups contributed to net revenue growth with the exception of the Global Technology & Services practice group. The number of consultants was 103 as of December 31, 2017, compared to 95 as of December 31, 2016.\nConsolidated net revenue was $716.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $94.6 million, or 15.2%, compared to 2017.

The net impact of the new revenue recognition standard increased Executive Search net revenue by approximately $8.0 million. The number of Executive Search consultants was 353 as of December 31, 2018, compared to 346 as of December 31, 2017. Executive Search productivity, as measured by annualized net Executive Search revenue per consultant, was $1.9 million and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The number of confirmed searches increased 11.8%, compared to 2017. The average revenue per executive search increased to $127,300 in 2018, compared to $120,300 in 2017. Heidrick Consulting net revenue decreased $6.2 million, or 9.0%, to $63.1 million in 2018, from $69.4 million in 2017.

The consideration the Company expects to receive under the terms of an enterprise agreement is comprised of a single fixed fee. Our enterprise agreements contain multiple performance obligations, the delivery of materials via SD Connect and material rights related to options to renew enterprise agreements at a significant discount. The Company allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract on a stand-alone selling price basis. The stand-alone selling price for the initial term of the enterprise agreement is outlined in the contract and is equal to the price paid by the client for the agreement over the initial term of the contract. The stand-alone selling price for the options to renew, or material right, are not directly observable and must be estimated. This estimate is required to reflect the discount the client would obtain when exercising the option to renew, adjusted for the likelihood that the option will be exercised. The Company estimates the likelihood of renewal using a historical analysis of client renewals. Access to SD Connect represents a right to access the Company's intellectual property that the client simultaneously receives and consumes as the Company performs under the agreement, and therefore the Company recognizes revenue over time. Given the continuous nature of this commitment, the Company utilizes straight-line ratable revenue recognition over the estimated subscription period as the Company's clients will receive and consume the benefits from SD Connect equally throughout the contract period. Revenue related to client renewals of enterprise agreements is recognized over the term of the renewal, which is generally twelve months. Enterprise agreements do not comprise a significant portion of the Company's revenue.\nImpairment charges. In 2017, the Company determined that the goodwill and intangible asset within the Culture Shaping and Leadership Consulting reporting units were impaired, which resulted in impairment charges of $39.2 million and $11.6 million, respectively, to write off all the goodwill and intangible assets associated with each of the reporting units. The impairments were non-cash in nature and did not affect our current liquidity, cash flows, borrowing capability or operations, nor did they impact the debt covenants under our credit agreement. The impairment charges are recorded within Impairment charges in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. In 2018, the Company completed the integration of its Leadership Consulting and Culture Shaping businesses into one combined service offering, Heidrick Consulting.\nKey Performance Indicators\n (2) Operating income for Europe includes $4.0 million of restructuring charges in 2017. \nRestructuring charges were $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Excluding the impact of restructuring charges in 2017, expenses increased $1.7 million from $34.6 million in 2017 to $36.3 million in 2018.\nOur 2019 first quarter guidance is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those disclosed under \"Item 1A - Risk Factors\" and in this \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" included in this Form 10-K. As such, actual results could vary from these projections.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGlobal Operations Support\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $2.7 million due to decreases in professional fees, office occupancy and hiring fees and temporary labor, partially offset by increases in internal travel and information technology costs.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense increased $19.2 million from 2016. Fixed compensation increased $7.1 million primarily due to increases in base salaries and payroll taxes, separation costs, and stock compensation expense, partially offset by a decrease in the deferred compensation plan due to market fluctuations. Variable compensation increased $12.1 million primarily due to higher bonus accruals for consultant performance.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $0.2 million primarily due to lower office occupancy, internal travel, and taxes and licenses, partially offset by an increase in bad debt.\n\nSalaries and employee benefits expense increased $2.8 million, or 15.4%, due to increases in management and support bonuses, stock compensation and separation costs, partially offset by a decrease in the deferred compensation plan due to market fluctuations.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our revenue and operating income by segment (in thousands):\nSalaries and employee benefits expense decreased $4.1 million due to decreases in base salaries and payroll taxes, stock compensation expense as a result of forfeitures during the year, and management and support bonuses, partially offset by increases in the deferred compensation plan due to market fluctuations.", "item_7_text": "Executive Search\n (4) Operating loss for Heidrick Consulting includes $50.7 million of impairment charges and $3.4 million of restructuring charges in 2017. \n (2) Includes restructuring charges of $15.7 million in 2017.

Excluding the impact of restructuring charges, the Europe segment reported operating income of $4.0 million.\nAt the Executive Search consultant level, there are fixed and variable components of compensation. Individuals are rewarded for their performance based on a system that directly ties a portion of their compensation to the amount of net revenue for which they are responsible. A portion of the reward may be based upon individual performance against a series of non-financial measures. Credit towards the variable portion of an executive search consultant's compensation is earned by generating net revenue for winning and executing work. Each quarter, we review and update the expected annual performance of all Executive Search consultants and accrue variable compensation accordingly. The amount of variable compensation that is accrued for each Executive Search consultant is based on a tiered payout model. Overall Company performance determines the amount available for total variable compensation. The more net revenue that is generated by the consultant, the higher the percentage credited towards the consultant's variable compensation and thus accrued by our Company as expense.\nAsia Pacific\nRestructuring charges were $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Consolidated total revenue increased $95.6 million, or 14.9%, to $735.7 million in 2018 from $640.1 million in 2017. The increase in total revenue was primarily due to the increase in revenue before reimbursements (net revenue).\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. The guidance requires entities that lease assets to recognize on their balance sheets the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases and to disclose key information about the leasing arrangements. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842 (Leases), which provides narrow amendments to clarify how to apply certain aspects of the new lease standard, and ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted Improvements to Topic 842 (Leases), which provides an additional, optional transition method that allows entities to initially apply the requirements by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. An entity that adopts this method must report comparative periods in accordance with current guidance (Topic 840). The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted.\nIn 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income, intended to improve the usefulness of information reported as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

ASU 2018-02 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company elected not to utilize the available option to reclassify stranded tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to retained earnings.\n\nExecutive Search\nThe Heidrick Consulting segment reported net revenue of $69.4 million in 2017, a decrease of 7.6% compared to $75.0 million in 2016. The decrease in net revenue was due to a decline in the volume of client work. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted results by $1.2 million, or 1.7%. There were 64 Heidrick Consulting Partner and Principal consultants at December 31, 2017, compared to 62 at December 31, 2016.\nRestructuring charges were $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. These charges include approximately $1.8 million in severance-related charges, $0.1 million in office-related charges and $0.1 million in professional fees and other expenses.\nAsia Pacific\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Post-retirement Benefit Cost, which is intended to improve the consistency, transparency and usefulness of net benefit cost disclosures. ASU No. 2017-07 requires that an employer report the service cost component of net benefit cost in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. Additionally, the other components of net benefit costs are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company's financial statements.\nImpairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $50.7 million due to the impairment of goodwill and amortizable intangible assets associated with our Leadership Consulting and Culture Shaping reporting units.

A portion of the $112.1 million is considered permanently reinvested in these foreign subsidiaries. If these funds were required to satisfy obligations in the United States, the repatriation of these funds could cause us to incur additional foreign withholding taxes. We expect to pay approximately $202.0 million in variable compensation related to 2018 performance in March and April 2019. In January 2019, we paid approximately $14.0 million in variable compensation that was deferred in prior years.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, the results of operations (in thousands, except per share data):\nWe pay the non-deferred portion of annual bonuses in the first quarter following the year in which they are earned.

Variable compensation increased $8.7 million due to higher bonus accruals for consultant performance.\nWe are currently forecasting 2019 first quarter net revenue of between $165 million and $175 million. Our 2019 first quarter guidance is based upon, among other things, management's assumptions for the anticipated volume of new executive search confirmations and leadership consulting and culture shaping projects, the current backlog, consultant productivity, consultant retention, the seasonality of our business and average currency rates from December 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $2.9 million from 2016 primarily due to decreases in intangible amortization and accretion as a result of current year impairments, litigation expense and professional fees, partially offset by increases in office occupancy and the use of external third-party consultants to complete client work.\nAsia Pacific reported net revenue of $86.9 million in 2017, an increase of 1.9% compared to $85.3 million in 2016.

The number of consultants was 80 as of December 31, 2017, compared to 82 as of December 31, 2016.\nFactors that may affect the outcome of the forward-looking statements include, among other things, leadership changes, our ability to attract, integrate, develop, manage and retain qualified consultants and senior leaders; our ability to prevent our consultants from taking our clients with them to another firm; our ability to maintain our professional reputation and brand name; the fact that our net revenue may be affected by adverse economic conditions; our clients' ability to restrict us from recruiting their employees; the aggressive competition we face; our heavy reliance on information management systems; the fact that we face the risk of liability in the services we perform; the fact that data security, data privacy and data protection laws and other evolving regulations and cross-border data transfer restrictions may limit the use of our services and adversely affect our business; social, political, regulatory and legal risks in markets where we operate; the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; the fact that we may not be able to align our cost structure with net revenue; unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings; our ability to realize our tax losses; the timing of the establishment or reversal of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets; any impairment of our goodwill, other intangible assets and other long-lived assets; our ability to execute and integrate future acquisitions; the fact that we have anti-takeover provisions that make an acquisition of us difficult and expensive; our ability to access additional credit; and the increased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks that could pose a risk to our systems, networks, solutions, services and data. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nIn 2017, we had an average of 1,798 employees, compared to an average of 1,716 employees in 2016.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, using the modified retrospective method. The Company applied the guidance to all contracts that were not complete as of the adoption date. The guidance requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for these goods or services. The Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative periods have not been restated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. See Note 3, Revenue in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n2018 Overview\nRecently Adopted Financial Accounting Standards\nOther, net was expense of $3.3 million in 2017 compared to income of $2.3 million in 2016. Other, net results declined primarily due to the HMRC employee benefit tax settlement of $2.4 million.\nRestructuring charges. During the fourth quarter 2017, the Company announced a restructuring plan to reduce overall costs and improve efficiencies in its operations. As a result of this plan, the Company incurred approximately $15.7 million in restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2017. These charges included approximately $13.1 million in severance-related charges, $2.3 million in professional fees and other expenses, and $0.3 million in office-related charges. There were no similar restructuring charges in 2018.\nThe following table sets forth certain financial information for each quarter of 2018 and 2017. The information is derived from our quarterly consolidated financial statements which are unaudited but which, in the opinion of management, have been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual consolidated financial statements included in this document. The consolidated financial data shown below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period.\nOperating income as a percentage of net revenue was 9.6% in 2018, compared to an operating loss margin of 4.3% in 2017. The change in operating income was primarily due to an increase in net revenue of $94.6 million and the impact of impairment\nBefore October 26, 2018, the Company was party to its Restated Credit Agreement, which was executed on June 30, 2015. The Restated Credit Agreement provided a single senior unsecured revolving line of credit with an aggregate commitment of up to $100 million, which included a sublimit of $25 million for letters of credit, and a $50 million expansion feature. Borrowings under the Restated Credit Agreement bore interest at the Company's election of the existing Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Restated Credit Agreement) or the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (as defined in the Restated Credit Agreement) plus a spread as determined by the Company's leverage ratio.\nDeferred taxes have been recorded for U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes related to undistributed foreign earnings that are not permanently reinvested. Annually, we assess material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements in order to determine whether these earnings should be distributed. If so, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate.\nLines of Credit. On October 26, 2018, the Company entered into a new Credit Agreement (the \"2018 Credit Agreement\") to replace the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"Restated Credit Agreement\") executed on June 30, 2015. The 2018 Credit Agreement provides the Company with a senior unsecured revolving line of credit with an aggregate commitment of $175 million, which includes a sublimit of $25 million for letters of credit, and a $10 million swingline loan sublimit. The agreement also includes a $75 million expansion feature. The 2018 Credit Agreement will mature in October 2023. Borrowings under the 2018 Credit Agreement bear interest at the Company's election of the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the 2018 Credit Agreement) or Adjusted LIBOR (as defined in the 2018 Credit Agreement) plus a spread as determined by the Company's leverage ratio.\nOperating income. Our consolidated operating income was $68.9 million in 2018, compared to a loss of $26.5 million, including impairment charges of $50.7 million and restructuring charges of $15.7 million in 2017. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations positively impacted operating income by $0.8 million or 1.2%. Excluding the impact of impairment and restructuring charges in 2017, operating income increased $29.0 million from $39.7 million to $68.9 million.\nAt the Heidrick Consulting consultant level, there are also fixed and variable components of compensation. Overall compensation is determined based on the total economic contribution of the Heidrick Consulting segment to the business as a whole. Individual consultant compensation can vary, and is derived from credits earned for delivering client work plus credits earned for contributions of intellectual and human capital, client relationship development and consulting practice development. Each quarter, we review and update the expected annual performance of all Heidrick Consulting consultants and accrue variable compensation accordingly.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company borrowed $20 million under the Restated Credit Agreement and elected the Adjusted LIBOR Rate. The Company subsequently repaid $8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and $12 million during the three months ended June 30, 2018.\nThe number of Executive Search and Heidrick Consulting consultants was 353 and 66, respectively, as of December 31, 2018, compared to 346 and 64, respectively, as of December 31, 2017. Specific to Executive Search, which is our largest business, productivity as measured by annualized net Executive Search revenue per consultant was $1.9 million and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The number of confirmed searches increased 11.8%, compared to 2017. The average revenue per executive search increased to $127,300 in 2018 compared to $120,300 in 2017.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense increased $14.5 million, or 15.9%, from 2017. Fixed compensation increased $5.7 million primarily due increases in base salaries and payroll taxes and retirement and benefits, partially offset by a decrease in separation costs. Base salaries, payroll taxes, and retirement and benefits increased due to additional headcount as a result of the Amrop acquisition. Variable compensation increased $8.8 million due to higher bonus accruals for consultant performance. The impact of the new revenue recognition standard increased salaries and benefits expense by approximately $0.7 million.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $1.0 million, or 2.0%, from 2017 primarily due to a decrease in communications, bad debt, and office occupancy, partially offset by increases in professional services, and internal travel.\n2019 Outlook\nThe Americas segment reported net revenue of $339.8 million in 2017, an increase of 8.5% from $313.3 million in 2016. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 5.7% increase in the number of executive search confirmations compared to the prior year as well as an increase in consultant headcount. All industry practice groups contributed to the increased net revenue. The number of consultants was 163 as of December 31, 2017, compared to 158 as of December 31, 2016.\nNet interest income was $1.1 million in 2018, a $0.7 million increase from net interest income of $0.4 million in 2017.\nAmericas\nThe Heidrick Consulting segment reported an operating loss of $62.4 million in 2017, a decrease of $57.0 million compared to an operating loss of $5.3 million in 2016. The increased operating loss primarily reflects $50.7 million of impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets, as well as restructuring charges of $3.4 million. Excluding the impact of impairment and restructuring charges, the Heidrick Consulting segment reported an operating loss of $8.4 million.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense increased $5.2 million, or 8.6% from 2017. Fixed compensation decreased by $0.7 million due to decreases in base salaries and payroll taxes and retirement and benefits, partially offset by an increase in talent acquisition and retention costs. Variable compensation increased $5.9 million due to higher bonus accruals for consultant performance. The impact of the new revenue recognition standard increased salaries and benefits expense by approximately $2.1 million.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations as well as other sections of this annual report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but instead represent only our beliefs, assumptions, expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside our control. These statements include statements other than historical information or statements of current condition and may relate to our future plans and objectives and results. By identifying these statements for you in this manner, we are alerting you to the possibility that our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, those discussed under the Section heading Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nOur Business\n\nContractual obligations. The following table presents our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018, and the expected timing of cash payments related to these contractual obligations (in millions):\nstatements. The future impact of this accounting guidance will be dependent on future modification events including the number of awards modified.\nWe ended the year with combined cash and cash equivalents of $279.9 million, an increase of $72.3 million compared to $207.5 million at December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to the strong cash inflows from operations partially offset by acquisition spend, restructuring payments and larger bonus payments year over year. We pay the majority of bonuses in the first quarter following the year in which they were earned. Employee bonuses are accrued throughout the year and are based on the Company's performance and the performance of the individual employee. We expect to pay approximately $202.0 million in bonuses related to 2018 performance in March and April 2019. In January 2019, we paid approximately $14.0 million in cash bonuses deferred in prior years.\nexchange fluctuations negatively impacted net revenue by $0.7 million, or 0.2%. There were 179 Partner and Principal consultants as of December 31, 2018, compared to 163 as of December 31, 2017.\nIn 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $67.0 million, principally reflecting net income net of non-cash charges of $21.1 million, an increase in accrued expenses of $18.3 million and a restructuring accrual of $13.0 million. The increase in accrued expenses primarily reflects approximately $148 million of current year bonus accruals, partially offset by $128 million of bonus payments for 2016 made in early 2017.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $3.2 million primarily due to increases in professional fees and office occupancy, partially offset by a decrease in hiring fees and temporary labor.\nRestructuring charges were $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. These charges included approximately $0.6 million in severance-related charges and $0.2 million in professional fees and other expenses.\nRevenue recognition. In our Executive Search segment, revenue is recognized as we satisfy our performance obligations by transferring a good or service to a client. Generally, each of our executive search contracts contain one performance obligation which is the process of identifying potentially qualified candidates for a specific client position. In most contracts, the transaction price includes both fixed and variable consideration. Fixed compensation is comprised of a retainer, equal to approximately one-third of the estimated first year compensation for the position to be filled, and indirect expenses, equal to a specified percentage of the retainer, as defined in the contract. The Company generally bills its clients for its retainer and indirect expenses in one-third increments over a three-month period commencing in the month of a client's acceptance of the contract. If actual compensation of a placed candidate exceeds the original compensation estimate, the Company is often authorized to bill the client for one-third of the excess compensation. The Company refers to this additional billing as uptick revenue. In most contracts, variable consideration is comprised of uptick revenue and direct expenses. The Company bills its clients for uptick revenue upon completion of the executive search, and direct expenses are billed as incurred.\nSalaries and employee benefits. Consolidated salaries and employee benefits expense increased $72.1 million, or 16.6%, to $506.3 million in 2018 from $434.2 million in 2017. The increase was due to higher fixed compensation of $24.9 million and\nHeidrick Consulting\nWe manage and assess our performance through various means, with primary financial and operational measures including net revenue, operating income, operating margin, Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) and Adjusted EBITDA margin (non-GAAP).\nThe Heidrick Consulting segment reported an operating loss of $13.6 million in 2018, an increase of $48.7 million, compared to an operating loss of $62.4 million in 2017. Excluding the impact of impairment and restructuring charges in 2017, operating loss decreased $5.4 million from a loss of $8.3 million to a loss of $13.6 million.\nWe are a leadership advisory firm providing executive search and consulting services. We help our clients build leadership teams by facilitating the recruitment, management and development of senior executives. We believe focusing on top-level services offers us several advantages that include access to and influence with key decision makers, increased potential for recurring search consulting engagements, higher fees per search, enhanced brand visibility and a leveraged global footprint, which create added barriers to entry for potential competitors. Working at the top of client organizations also allows us to attract and retain high-caliber consultants.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments including the recognition of unrealized changes in fair value within net income. The adoption of this guidance resulted in a reclassification of accumulated unrealized gains of approximately $6.1 million from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. The impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2018, was not material. The comparative periods have not been restated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.\nOperating income was $75.3 million in 2017, an increase of $3.3 million compared to $72.0 million in 2016. Excluding the impact of restructuring charges, the Americas segment reported operating income of $76.1 million.\nQuarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)\nAmericas\nTotal revenue. Consolidated total revenue increased $39.2 million, or 6.5%, to $640.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $600.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in total revenue was primarily due to the increase in revenue before reimbursements (net revenue).\nOn February 11, 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase shares of our common stock with an aggregate total amount up to $50 million. We intend from time to time and as business conditions warrant to purchase shares of our common stock on the open market or in negotiated or block trades. No time limit has been set for completion of this program. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in 2018. The most recent purchase of shares of common stock occurred during the year ended December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2018, we have purchased 1,038,670 shares of our common stock for a total of $28.3 million and $21.7 million remains available for future purchases under the authorization. Unless terminated or extended earlier by resolution of the Board of Directors, the program will expire when the amount authorized for repurchases has been spent.\nIncome taxes. Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate.\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, there are different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur periodically, that could materially impact the financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nNote: Totals and subtotals may not equal the sum of individual line items due to rounding.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. Consolidated general and administrative expenses decreased $6.5 million, or 4.4%, to $140.8 million in 2018 from $147.3 million in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the use of external third-party consultants by Heidrick Consulting, lower expenses associated with global partner meetings, lower intangible amortization due to intangible asset impairment in the prior year, and bad debt expense, partially offset by increases in professional fees and office occupancy. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted general and administrative expenses by $0.8 million, or 0.6%.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which is intended to reduce diversity in practice as to how certain cash receipts and cash payments should be presented and classified. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company reclassified approximately $2.9 million of earnout payments from cash flows used in financing activities to cash flows provided by operating activities. The reclassified amount represents the amount of the earnout payement that is in excess of the earnout accrual established at the acquisition date.\nA portion of our Executive Search consultants' and management cash bonuses is deferred and paid over a three-year vesting period. The compensation expense related to the amounts being deferred is recognized on a graded vesting attribution method over the requisite service period. This service period begins on January 1 of the respective fiscal year and continues through the deferral date, which coincides with our bonus payments in the first quarter of the following year, and for an additional three year vesting period. The deferrals are recorded in Accrued salaries and employee benefits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense increased $45.7 million, or 21.1%, from 2017. Fixed compensation increased $14.6 million primarily due to talent acquisition and retention costs, stock compensation, and retirement and benefits, partially offset by a decrease in the deferred compensation plan due to market fluctuations. Variable compensation increased $31.1 million primarily due to higher bonus accruals for consultant performance. The impact of the new revenue recognition standard increased salaries and benefits expense by approximately $2.9 million.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $3.7 million, or 12.1% from 2017 primarily due to ongoing general and administrative expenses related to the Amrop acquisition, professional fees, and office occupancy.\nCash used in investing activities was $35.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the acquisitions of JCA Group, DSI and Philosophy IB, capital expenditures of $5.3 million and the purchase of available for sale securities of $2.5 million.\nRestructuring charges were $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. These charges included approximately $0.6 million in severance-related charges and $0.2 million in professional fees and other expenses.\n (1) Operating income for the Americas includes $0.8 million of restructuring charges in 2017. \nGlobal Operations Support expenses in 2017 decreased $1.3 million, or 3.1%, to $40.0 million from $41.3 million in 2016.\nGeneral. We continually evaluate our liquidity requirements, capital needs and availability of capital resources based on our operating needs. We believe that our available cash balances together with the funds expected to be generated from operations and funds available under our committed revolving credit facility will be sufficient to finance our operations for the foreseeable future, as well as to finance the cash payments associated with our cash dividends and stock repurchase program.\nRecent Financial Accounting Standards\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under either the 2018 Credit Agreement or the Restated Credit Agreement. The Company was in compliance with the financial and other covenants under both facilities and no event of default existed.\nIn addition to executive search, we provide consulting services including executive leadership assessment, leadership, team and board development, succession planning, talent strategy, people performance, inter-team collaboration, culture shaping and organizational transformation.\nExecutive Overview\nThe recognition of deferred tax assets is based on management's belief that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits associated with temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits will be utilized. We assess the recoverability of the deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis. In making this assessment, we consider all positive and negative evidence, and all potential sources of taxable income including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, tax-planning strategies, projected future taxable income and recent financial performance.\nIn addition to the contractual obligations included in the above table, we have liabilities related to certain employee benefit plans. These liabilities are recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018. The obligations related to these employee benefit plans are described in Note 12, Employee Benefit Plans, and Note 13, Pension Plan and Life Insurance Contract, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As the timing of cash disbursements related to these employee benefit plans is uncertain, we have not included these obligations in the above table. The table excludes our liability for uncertain tax positions including accrued interest and penalties, which totaled $1.5 million as of December 31, 2018, since we cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities.\nOther, net was income of $0.5 million in 2018, compared to expense of $3.3 million in 2017. Other, net results improved primarily due to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (\"HMRC\") employee benefit tax settlement of $2.4 million in 2017, as well as the positive impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $1.2 million.\nExecutive Search and Heidrick Consulting performance is also measured using consultant headcount. Specific to Executive Search, confirmation trends, consultant productivity and average revenue per search are used to measure performance.\nRevenue from our executive search engagement performance obligation is recognized over time as our clients simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by the Company's performance. Revenue from executive search engagements is recognized over the expected average period of performance, in proportion to the estimated personnel time incurred to fulfill our obligations under the executive search contract. Revenue is generally recognized over a period of approximately six months.\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $1.2 million due to decreases in internal travel, professional fees, hiring fees and communications services, partially offset by an increase in office occupancy.\nThe number of consultants, confirmation trends, number of searches or projects completed, productivity levels and the average revenue per search or project will vary from quarter to quarter, affecting net revenue and operating margin.\nWe believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill and other intangible asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the assumptions used are highly susceptible to changes in the operating results and cash flows of our reportable segments.\nYear ended December 31, 2018 compared to year ended December 31, 2017\nCash flows used in investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to capital expenditures of $6.0 million, the acquisition of Amrop for $3.1 million and purchases of available for sale securities of $2.2 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities of $3.0 million. The increase in capital expenditures is primarily the result of office build-outs and a global information technology update.\nOperating income. Our consolidated operating income was a loss of $26.5 million in 2017, compared to income of $35.2 million in 2016. The operating loss was primarily due to $50.7 million in impairment charges as well as $15.7 million in restructuring charges. Excluding impairment and restructuring charges, the Company reported operating income of $39.9 million. Exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted operating income by $0.2 million, or 0.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nEurope reported net revenue of $145.3 million in 2018, an increase of 16.0% from $125.3 million in 2017. The increase in net revenue was due to a 13.1% increase in the number of executive search confirmations compared to the prior year and the Amrop acquisition. The net impact of the new revenue recognition standard increased revenue by approximately $1.0 million. All industry practice groups contributed to net revenue growth. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations positively impacted net revenue by $4.7 million, or 3.3%. There were 101 Partner and Principal consultants as of December 31, 2018, compared to 103 as of December 31, 2017.\nCash used in financing activities in 2017 was $17.1 million due to cash dividend payments of $10.1 million, earnout payments related to the Co Company and Scambler MacGregor acquisitions of $4.6 million and the payment of employee tax withholdings on equity transactions of $2.4 million. Gross proceeds and payments on the Company's line of credit were each $40.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIncome taxes. See Note 17, Income Taxes.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2017-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation, Scope of Modification Accounting, which is intended to provide clarity and reduce diversity in practice, cost and complexity when implementing a change in the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. ASU No. 2017-09 requires that an entity should account for the effects of a modification unless the fair value, vesting conditions and whether the award is classified as a liability instrument or an equity instrument remain unchanged in the modification. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company's financial\nThe Asia Pacific segment reported operating income of $0.5 million in 2017, a decrease of $3.4 million compared to $3.9 million in 2016. Excluding the impact of restructuring charges, the Asia Pacific segment reported operating income of $2.6 million.\nRestructuring charges were $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. These charges included approximately $1.8 million in severance-related charges, $0.1 million in office-related charges and $0.1 million in professional fees and other expenses.\nWe operate our Executive Search business in the Americas, Europe (which includes Africa) and Asia Pacific (which includes the Middle East), and we operate our Heidrick Consulting business globally (See Note 18, Segment Information).\nRevenue before reimbursements (net revenue). Consolidated net revenue increased $39.0 million or 6.7%, to $621.4 million in 2017, from $582.4 million in 2016. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted results by $1.4 million, or 0.2%. Executive Search net revenue was $552.0 million in 2017, an increase of $44.7 million from 2016. The increase in Executive Search net revenue was the result of growth in the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. Heidrick Consulting net revenue decreased $5.7 million, or 7.6%, to $69.4 million in 2017 from $75.0 million in 2016.\nGeneral. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3, Revenue, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. If actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known.\nCash used in investing activities was $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to capital expenditures of $14.0 million and purchases of available for sale securities of $2.3 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities of $1.4 million. The increase in capital expenditures is primarily the result of office build-outs and a global information technology update.\nCash used in financing activities in 2016 was $17.2 million due to cash dividend payments of $10.0 million, earnout payments for the Senn Delaney, Scambler MacGregor and Co Company acquisitions of $4.6 million, and the payment of employee tax withholdings on equity transactions of $2.7 million.\nRestructuring charges. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company announced a restructuring plan to reduce overall costs and improve efficiencies in its operations. As a result of this plan, the Company incurred approximately $15.7 million in restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2017. These charges included approximately $13.1 million in severance-related charges, $2.3 million in professional fees and other expenses and $0.3 million in office-related charges. There were no similar restructuring charges in 2016.\n\nHeidrick Consulting\nThe Americas segment reported net revenue of $405.3 million in 2018, an increase of 19.3% from $339.8 million in 2017. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 14.4% increase in the number of executive search confirmations, compared to the prior year, as well as an increase in average revenue per executive search. The net impact of the new revenue recognition standard increased revenue by approximately $4.1 million. All industry practice groups contributed to the increased net revenue. Foreign\nBorrowings under the 2018 Credit Agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, Permitted Acquisitions (as defined in the 2018 Credit Agreement) and for other general purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries. The obligations under the 2018 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of the Company's subsidiaries.\n (1) Includes impairment charges of $50.7 million related to Heidrick Consulting in 2017. \nAs a percentage of net revenue, general and administrative expenses were 23.7% in 2017, compared to 25.3% in 2016.\n(1) Represents the fair value of the obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets primarily related to our obligation at the end of the lease term to return office space to the landlord in its original condition.\nThe Asia Pacific segment reported operating income of $16.0 million in 2018, an increase of $15.5 million compared to $0.5 million in 2017. Excluding the impact of restructuring charges in 2017, operating income increased $13.4 million from $2.6 million to $16.0 million.\nRestructuring charges were $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. These charges included approximately $3.9 million in severance-related charges and $0.1 million in in office-related charges.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOff-balance sheet arrangements. We do not have material off-balance sheet arrangements, special purpose entities, trading activities of non-exchange traded contracts or transactions with related parties.\nOperating income was $96.9 million in 2018, an increase of $21.5 million, compared to $75.3 million in 2017. Excluding the impact of restructuring charges in 2017, operating income increased $20.8 million from $76.1 million in 2017 to $96.9 million in 2018.\nThe Company capitalized approximately $1.0 million of loan acquisition costs related to the 2018 Credit Agreement, which will be amortized over the remaining term of the agreement.\nEurope\nAs required under Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, the Company now estimates uptick revenue at contract inception, based on a portfolio approach, utilizing the expected value method based on a historical analysis of uptick revenue realized in the Company's geographic regions and industry practices, and initially records a contract's uptick revenue in an amount that is probable not to result in a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized when the actual amount of uptick revenue for that contract is known. Differences between the estimated and actual amounts of variable consideration are recorded when known. The Company does not estimate revenue for direct expenses as it is not materially different than recognizing revenue as direct expenses are incurred.\nThe number of Executive Search and Heidrick Consulting consultants was 346 and 64, respectively, as of December 31, 2017 compared to 335 and 62, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. Specific to Executive Search, productivity as measured by annualized net Executive Search revenue per consultant was $1.6 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The number of confirmed searches increased 4.5%, compared to 2016. The average revenue per executive search increased to $120,300 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $117,700 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGlobal Operations Support expenses decreased $3.8 million, or 9.5%, to $36.3 million from $40.0 million in 2017.\nOur Compensation Model\nAdditionally, we review long-lived assets, such as property, equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge, equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, is recognized.\nIncome taxes. See Note 17, Income Taxes.\nRevenue is driven by market conditions and a combination of the number of executive search engagements and leadership consulting and culture shaping projects and the average revenue per search or project. With the exception of compensation expense, incremental increases in revenue do not necessarily result in proportionate increases in costs, particularly operating and administrative expenses, thus creating the potential to improve operating margins.\nAs a percentage of net revenue, salaries and employee benefits expense was 70.7% in 2018, compared to 69.9% in 2017.\nRestructuring charges were $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. These charges included approximately $2.1 million in severance-related charges, $1.2 million in professional fees and other expenses and $0.1 million in office-related charges.\nThe following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, our results of operations as a percentage of revenue before reimbursements (net revenue):\nRestructuring charges were $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. These charges included approximately $3.9 million in severance-related charges and $0.1 million in office-related charges.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $2.8 million from 2016 primarily due to ongoing general and administrative expenses related to the JCA Group acquisition including increases in amortization and accretion and professional services.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets. We review goodwill for impairment annually. We also review goodwill and long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value has fallen below the carrying amount of an asset. We review factors such as a significant change in business climate, attrition of key personnel, changes in financial condition or results of operations, a prolonged decline in our stock price and market capitalization, competition, and other factors to determine if an impairment test is necessary. Our annual impairment test begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a fair value based goodwill impairment test. The qualitative assessment includes evaluating whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that fair values of reporting units are greater than the carrying values. If the qualitative factors do not indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair values of the reporting units are greater than the carrying values then we perform the fair value test.\ncharges and restructuring charges of $50.7 and $15.6 million, respectively, in 2017, partially offset by an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense of $72.1 million. Salaries and employee benefits expense as a percentage of net revenue was 70.7% in 2018 and 69.9% in 2017. General and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue was 19.7% in 2018 and 23.7% in 2017.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense increased $0.2 million from 2016. Fixed compensation increased $1.0 million primarily due to the acquisitions of Decision Strategies International, Inc. (\"DSI\") and Philosophy IB, partially offset by decreases in minimum guarantee and sign-on bonus amortization and separation. Variable compensation decreased $0.9 million due to lower bonus accruals.\nAs a percentage of net revenue, general and administrative expenses were 19.7% in 2018, compared to 23.7% in 2017.\nNet non-operating income (expense). Net non-operating expense was $2.9 million in 2017, compared to net non-operating income of $2.5 million in 2016.\nRestructuring charges were $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. These charges included approximately $2.1 million in severance-related charges, $1.2 million in professional fees and other expenses and $0.1 million in office-related charges.\n (5) Operating loss for Global Operations Support includes $5.5 million of restructuring charges in 2017. \nIn 2016, cash provided by operating activities was $21.9 million, principally reflecting net income net of non-cash charges of $41.3 million and an increase in the net retirement and pension plan liability of $4.2 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $14.4 million, a change in other assets and liabilities of $3.0 million, a change in accrued liabilities of $3.8 million and an increase in prepaid expenses of $2.3 million.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense increased $3.9 million, or 8.0%, from 2017. Fixed compensation increased $4.6 million primarily due to increases in talent acquisition and retention costs, and base salaries and payroll taxes, partially offset by a decrease in retirement and benefits. Variable compensation decreased $0.7 million due to lower bonus accruals for consultant performance. The impact of the new revenue recognition standard decreased salaries and benefits expense by approximately $2.7 million.\nEurope\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company borrowed $40 million under the Restated Credit Agreement and elected the Adjusted LIBOR rate. The Company subsequently repaid $15 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and $25 million during the three months ended June 30, 2017.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $4.8 million, or 16.7%, from 2017 primarily as a result of decreases in the use of external third-party consultants and intangible amortization as a result of impairment in the prior year, partially offset by an increase in professional services.\nCash flows used in financing activities. Cash used in financing activities in 2018 was $17.0 million due to cash dividend payments of $10.2 million, earnout payments related to the JCA Group acquisitions of $3.6 million and the payment of employee tax withholdings on equity transactions of $2.2 million. Gross proceeds and payments on the Company's line of credit were each $20.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe Europe segment reported operating income of $5.8 million in 2018 compared to less than $0.1 million in 2017. Excluding the impact of restructuring charges in 2017, operating income increased $1.8 million from $4.0 million in 2017 to $5.8 million in 2018.\nIn our Heidrick Consulting segment, revenue is recognized as we satisfy our performance obligations by transferring a good or service to a client. Heidrick Consulting enters into contracts with clients that outline the general terms and conditions of the assignment to provide succession planning, executive assessment, top team and board effectiveness and culture shaping programs. The consideration the Company expects to receive under each contract is generally fixed. Most of our consulting contracts contain one performance obligation, which is the overall process of providing the consulting service requested by the client. The majority of our consulting revenue is recognized over time utilizing both input and output methods. Contracts that contain coaching sessions, training sessions or the completion of assessments are recognized using the output method as each session or assessment is delivered to the client. Contracts that contain general consulting work are recognized using the input method utilizing a measure of progress that is based on time incurred on the project.\nThe Company will adopt the guidance on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method without restatement of the prior periods. As such, prior periods will continue to be presented under the existing guidance in Topic 840. The Company is currently performing its evaluation of the guidance. The Company's lease portfolio is primarily comprised of office leases, which are currently classified as operating leases and will continue to be classified as operating leases under the new guidance. The adoption of the guidance will have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets with respect to recording a right-of-use asset and lease liability for each of the Company's leases. The Company will utilize the available practical expedient to not separate the non-lease components from the lease components in its office leases. The Company is currently assessing the impact of utilizing the practical expedient, however,the use of the practical expedient will increase the total lease liability. The Company does not anticipate a significant change in expense recognition as it relates to the new guidance.\n (3) Operating income for Asia Pacific includes $2.0 million of restructuring charges in 2017. \nThe Company operates four reporting units: Americas, Europe (which includes Africa), Asia Pacific (which includes the Middle East) and Heidrick Consulting. The goodwill impairment test is completed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. The fair value of each of the Company's reporting units is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology. The discounted cash flow approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of future market growth and trends, forecasted revenue and costs, capital investments, appropriate discount rates, certain assumptions to allocate shared costs, assets and liabilities, historical and projected performance of our reporting units, the outlook for the executive search industry and the macroeconomic conditions affecting each of our reporting units. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. The fair value of our reporting units is also impacted by our overall market capitalization and may be impacted by volatility in our stock price and assumed control premium, among other factors. As a result, actual future results may differ from those estimates and may result in a future impairment charge. These assumptions are updated annually, at a minimum, to reflect information concerning our reportable segments. The Company continues to monitor potential triggering events including changes in the business climate in which it operates, the Company's market capitalization compared to its book value, and the Company's recent operating performance. Any changes in these factors could result in an impairment charge. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount; however, the loss recognized is not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nhigher variable compensation of $47.2 million. Fixed compensation increased due to talent acquisition and retention costs, stock compensation, base salaries and payroll taxes, and retirement and benefits, partially offset by a decline in the deferred compensation plan due to market fluctuations. Our acquisition of Amrop in January 2018 contributed to the increase in base salaries and payroll taxes and retirement and benefits. Variable compensation increased due to increased production over the prior year. The impact of the new revenue recognition standard increased salaries and benefits expense by approximately $3.0 million. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted salaries and employee benefits expenses by $2.4 million, or 0.5%.\nImpairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $50.7 million due to the impairment of goodwill and amortizable intangible assets associated with our Leadership Consulting and Culture Shaping reporting units. The impairment charge is recorded within Impairment charges in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2017. In 2018, the Company completed the integration of its Leadership Consulting and Culture Shaping businesses into one combined service offering, Heidrick Consulting.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016\nSalaries and employee benefits expense increased $3.1 million from 2016. Fixed compensation remained consistent with the prior year due to decreases in base salaries and payroll taxes and minimum guarantee and sign-on bonus amortization, offset by increases in retirement and benefits and stock compensation. Variable compensation increased $3.1 million due to higher bonus accruals for consultant performance.\nOur executive search contracts contain a replacement guarantee which provides for an additional search to be completed, free of charge except for expense reimbursements, should the candidate presented by the Company be hired by the client and subsequently terminated by the client for performance reasons within a specified period of time. The replacement guarantee is an assurance warranty, which is not a performance obligation under the terms of the executive search contract, as the Company does not provide any services under the terms of the guarantee that transfer benefits to the client in excess of assuring that the identified candidate complies with the agreed-upon specifications. The Company accounts for the replacement guarantee under the relevant warranty guidance in ASC 460 - Guarantees.\nCash flows provided by operating activities. In 2018, cash provided by operating activities was $102.9 million, principally reflecting net income net of non-cash charges of $68.6 million, an increase in accrued expenses of $71.5 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $16.8 million and restructuring payments of $11.6 million. The increase in accrued expenses primarily reflects approximately $202.0 million of current year bonus accruals, partially offset by $148.0 million of bonus payments for 2017 made in early 2018.\nSalaries and employee benefits. Consolidated salaries and employee benefits expense increased $34.1 million, or 8.5%, to $434.2 million in 2017 from $400.1 million in 2016. The increase was due to higher variable compensation of $23.2 million and higher fixed compensation of $10.9 million. Fixed compensation increased due to higher average headcount due to recent acquisitions, new hires over the last year and the HMRC employee benefit tax settlement of $1.5 million. Variable compensation increased due to increased production over the prior year. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations positively impacted salaries and benefits expense by $0.4 million, or 0.1%.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash, which requires that the statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning of period and end of period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The adoption of this guidance increased the Company's beginning and ending balances of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows by approximately $0.4 million and $0.6 million, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2018. Beginning and ending balances of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows increased by approximately $0.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2017. Beginning and ending balances of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows increased by approximately $7.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nWe provide our services to a broad range of clients through the expertise of over 400 consultants located in major cities around the world. Our executive search services are provided on a retained basis. Revenue before reimbursements of out-of-pocket expenses ( net revenue\u201d) consists of retainers and indirect expenses billed to clients. Typically, we are paid a retainer for our executive search services equal to approximately one-third of the estimated first-year compensation for the position to be filled. In addition, if the actual compensation of a placed candidate exceeds the estimated compensation, we often are authorized to bill the client for one-third of the excess. Indirect expenses are calculated as a percentage of the retainer with certain dollar limits per search.\nThe Heidrick Consulting segment reported net revenue of $63.1 million in 2018, a decrease of 9.0% compared to $69.4 million in 2017. The decline in revenue was primarily the result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard and its $3.8 million negative impact on revenue associated with enterprise agreements. Enterprise agreements are now recognized over a longer term due to certain renewal options included in the contract. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations positively impacted results by $0.7 million, or 1.1%. There were 66 Heidrick Consulting Partner and Principal consultants as of December 31, 2018, compared to 64 as of December 31, 2017.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nEach of the Company's contracts has an expected duration of one year or less. Accordingly, the Company has elected to utilize the available practical expedient related to the disclosure of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations under its contracts. The Company has also elected the available practical expedients related to adjusting for the effects of a significant financing component and the capitalization of contract acquisition costs. The Company charges and collects from its clients, sales tax and value added taxes as required by certain jurisdictions. The Company has made an accounting policy election to exclude these items from the transaction price in its contracts.\nRevenue before reimbursements (net revenue). Consolidated net revenue increased $94.6 million, or 15.2%, to $716.0 million in 2018 from $621.4 million in 2017. Foreign exchange rates positively impacted results by $4.0 million, or 0.6%. Executive Search net revenue was $652.9 million in 2018, an increase of $100.8 million compared to 2017. The increase in Executive Search net revenue was the result of growth in the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Our acquisition of Amrop in January 2018 also contributed to the growth in Executive Search net revenue. The net impact of the new revenue recognition standard increased Executive Search net revenue by approximately $8.0 million. Heidrick Consulting net revenue decreased $6.2 million, or 9.0%, to $63.1 million in 2018 from $69.4 million in 2017. Heidrick Consulting net revenue declined by approximately $3.8 million due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard and its impact on revenue associated with enterprise agreements.\nNet interest income was $0.4 million in 2017, a $0.2 million increase from net interest income of $0.2 million in 2016.\nImpairment charges. In 2017, the Company determined that the goodwill and intangible assets within the Culture Shaping and Leadership Consulting reporting units were impaired, which resulted in impairment charges of $39.2 million and $11.6 million, respectively, to write off all the goodwill and intangible assets associated with each of the reporting units. The impairments were non-cash in nature and did not affect our current liquidity, cash flows, borrowing capability or operations, nor did they impact the debt covenants under our credit agreement. The impairment charges are recorded within Impairment charges in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. In 2018, the Company completed the integration of its Leadership Consulting and Culture Shaping businesses into one combined service offering, Heidrick Consulting.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $3.3 million, or 13.6% from 2017 primarily due to decreases in bad debt, internal travel and office occupancy.\n(1) Includes $39.2 million of goodwill and intangible asset impairment for the three months ended June 30, 2017. Includes $11.6 million of goodwill and intangible asset impairment and $15.6 million of restructuring charges for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nThe mix of individual consultants who generate revenue in Executive Search and economic contributions in Heidrick Consulting can significantly affect the total amount of compensation expense recorded, which directly impacts operating margin. As a result, the variable portion of the compensation expense may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. The total variable compensation is discretionary, and is based on Company-wide financial targets approved by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.\nNet non-operating income (expense). Net non-operating income was $1.6 million in 2018, compared to expense of $2.9 million in 2017.\nEurope reported net revenue of $125.3 million in 2017, an increase of 15.3% from $108.8 million in 2016. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 6.2% increase in the number of executive search confirmations compared to the prior year and an increase in consultant headcount. Our acquisition of JCA Group Limited (\"JCA Group\") in August 2016 also contributed to the year-over-year growth in net revenue. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted results by $1.0 million, or 0.8%. All industry practice groups contributed to net revenue growth with the exception of the Global Technology & Services practice group. The number of consultants was 103 as of December 31, 2017, compared to 95 as of December 31, 2016.\nConsolidated net revenue was $716.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $94.6 million, or 15.2%, compared to 2017. Executive Search net revenue was $652.9 million in 2018, an increase of $100.8 million compared to 2017. The increase in Executive Search net revenue was the result of growth in the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. Our acquisition of Amrop A/S (\"Amrop\") in January 2018 also contributed to the growth in Executive Search net revenue. The net impact of the new revenue recognition standard increased Executive Search net revenue by approximately $8.0 million. The number of Executive Search consultants was 353 as of December 31, 2018, compared to 346 as of December 31, 2017. Executive Search productivity, as measured by annualized net Executive Search revenue per consultant, was $1.9 million and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The number of confirmed searches increased 11.8%, compared to 2017. The average revenue per executive search increased to $127,300 in 2018, compared to $120,300 in 2017. Heidrick Consulting net revenue decreased $6.2 million, or 9.0%, to $63.1 million in 2018, from $69.4 million in 2017. Heidrick Consulting net revenue declined by approximately $3.8 million due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard and its impact on revenue associated with enterprise agreements. The number of Heidrick Consulting consultants was 66 as of December 31, 2018, compared to 64 as of December 31, 2017.\nThe Company enters into enterprise agreements with clients to provide a license for online access, via the Company's SD Connect platform, to training and other proprietary material related to the Company's culture shaping programs. The consideration the Company expects to receive under the terms of an enterprise agreement is comprised of a single fixed fee. Our enterprise agreements contain multiple performance obligations, the delivery of materials via SD Connect and material rights related to options to renew enterprise agreements at a significant discount. The Company allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract on a stand-alone selling price basis. The stand-alone selling price for the initial term of the enterprise agreement is outlined in the contract and is equal to the price paid by the client for the agreement over the initial term of the contract. The stand-alone selling price for the options to renew, or material right, are not directly observable and must be estimated. This estimate is required to reflect the discount the client would obtain when exercising the option to renew, adjusted for the likelihood that the option will be exercised. The Company estimates the likelihood of renewal using a historical analysis of client renewals. Access to SD Connect represents a right to access the Company's intellectual property that the client simultaneously receives and consumes as the Company performs under the agreement, and therefore the Company recognizes revenue over time. Given the continuous nature of this commitment, the Company utilizes straight-line ratable revenue recognition over the estimated subscription period as the Company's clients will receive and consume the benefits from SD Connect equally throughout the contract period. Revenue related to client renewals of enterprise agreements is recognized over the term of the renewal, which is generally twelve months. Enterprise agreements do not comprise a significant portion of the Company's revenue.\nImpairment charges. In 2017, the Company determined that the goodwill and intangible asset within the Culture Shaping and Leadership Consulting reporting units were impaired, which resulted in impairment charges of $39.2 million and $11.6 million, respectively, to write off all the goodwill and intangible assets associated with each of the reporting units. The impairments were non-cash in nature and did not affect our current liquidity, cash flows, borrowing capability or operations, nor did they impact the debt covenants under our credit agreement. The impairment charges are recorded within Impairment charges in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. In 2018, the Company completed the integration of its Leadership Consulting and Culture Shaping businesses into one combined service offering, Heidrick Consulting.\nKey Performance Indicators\n (2) Operating income for Europe includes $4.0 million of restructuring charges in 2017. \nRestructuring charges were $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Excluding the impact of restructuring charges in 2017, expenses increased $1.7 million from $34.6 million in 2017 to $36.3 million in 2018.\nOur 2019 first quarter guidance is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those disclosed under \"Item 1A - Risk Factors\" and in this \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" included in this Form 10-K. As such, actual results could vary from these projections.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGlobal Operations Support\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $2.7 million due to decreases in professional fees, office occupancy and hiring fees and temporary labor, partially offset by increases in internal travel and information technology costs.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense increased $19.2 million from 2016.

Variable compensation increased $12.1 million primarily due to higher bonus accruals for consultant performance.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $0.2 million primarily due to lower office occupancy, internal travel, and taxes and licenses, partially offset by an increase in bad debt.\n\nSalaries and employee benefits expense increased $2.8 million, or 15.4%, due to increases in management and support bonuses, stock compensation and separation costs, partially offset by a decrease in the deferred compensation plan due to market fluctuations.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our revenue and operating income by segment (in thousands):\nSalaries and employee benefits expense decreased $4.1 million due to decreases in base salaries and payroll taxes, stock compensation expense as a result of forfeitures during the year, and management and support bonuses, partially offset by increases in the deferred compensation plan due to market
