Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, and the Notes and Schedules related thereto, which are included in this Annual Report.\nCompany Overview\nNuverra is a leading provider of comprehensive, full-cycle environmental solutions to customers focused on the development and ongoing production of oil and natural gas from shale formations in the United States. We provide one-stop, total environmental solutions and wellsite logistics management, including delivery, collection, treatment and disposal of solid and liquid materials that are used in and generated by the drilling, completion, and ongoing production of shale oil and natural gas.\nWe operate in shale basins where customer exploration and production ( E&P\u201d) activities are predominantly focused on shale oil and natural gas as follows:\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Oil shale areas: includes our operations in the Bakken and Eagle Ford Shale areas.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Natural gas shale areas: includes our operations in the Marcellus, Utica, and Haynesville Shale areas.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We support our customers' demand for diverse, comprehensive and regulatory compliant environmental solutions required for the safe and efficient drilling, completion and production of oil and natural gas from shale formations.\nOur service offering focuses on providing comprehensive environmental and logistics management solutions within three primary groups:\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Logistics and Wellsite Services: Delivery of freshwater to wellsites, freshwater procurement and transfer services, staging and storage of equipment and materials, rental of wellsite equipment, and construction services including wellpads.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Water Midstream: Collection and transportation of produced water from wellsites to disposal network via trucking or a fixed pipeline system, supplying freshwater for drilling and completion via pipeline system, gathering systems for collection and transportation of flowback and produced water to disposal wells.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Disposal Wells and Landfill: Liquid waste water from hydraulic fracturing operations, liquid waste water from well production, and solid drilling waste.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We utilize a broad array of assets to meet our customers' logistics and environmental management needs. Our logistics assets include trucks and trailers, temporary and permanent pipelines, temporary and permanent storage facilities, ancillary rental equipment, treatment facilities, and liquid and solid waste disposal sites. We continue to expand our suite of solutions to customers who demand safety, environmental compliance and accountability from their service providers.\nIn order to address our liquidity issues due to the prolonged depression in oil and natural gas prices, on May 1, 2017, the Company and certain of its material subsidiaries (collectively with the Company, the Nuverra Parties\u201d) filed voluntary petitions under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code\u201d) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the Bankruptcy Court\u201d) to pursue prepackaged plans of reorganization (together, and as amended, the Plan\u201d). On July 25, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the Confirmation Order\u201d) confirming the Plan. The Plan became effective on August 7, 2017 (the Effective Date\u201d), when all remaining conditions to the effectiveness of the Plan were satisfied or waived. Although the Nuverra Parties emerged from bankruptcy on the Effective Date, the bankruptcy cases will remain pending until closed by the Bankruptcy Court.\nUpon emergence, we elected to apply fresh start accounting effective July 31, 2017, to coincide with the timing of our normal accounting period close. Refer to Note 5 on Fresh Start Accounting\u201d in the Notes to the Financial Statements for additional information on the selection of this date. As a result of the application of fresh start accounting, as well as the effects of the implementation of the Plan, a new entity for financial reporting purposes was created, and as such, the condensed consolidated financial statements on or after August 1, 2017, are not comparable with the condensed consolidated financial statements prior to that date.\nReferences to Successor\u201d or Successor Company\u201d refer to the financial position and results of operations of the reorganized Company subsequent to July 31, 2017. References to Predecessor\u201d or Predecessor Company\u201d refer to the financial position and results of operations of the Company on and prior to July 31, 2017.\nTrends Affecting Our Operating Results\nOur results are driven by demand for our services, which are in turn affected by E&P spending trends in the shale basins in which we operate, in particular the level of drilling and completion activities (which impacts the amount of environmental waste products being managed) and active wells (which impacts the amount of produced water being managed). In general, drilling and completion activities in the oil and natural gas industry is affected by the market prices (or anticipated prices) for those commodities.\nDue to oil prices beginning to recover in 2017 from historic lows, drilling and completion activities increased in all of our active basins. We would expect continued stability in oil prices or further price growth to lead to increased drilling and completion activities by our customer base during 2018 when compared to 2017. Increased drilling and completion activities would likely lead to a higher demand for our services in 2018; however, there is no guarantee that oil prices will remain stable or increase, drilling and completion activities in basins will continue to increase, or we will see an increase in a demand for our services in 2018.\nOur results are also driven by a number of other factors, including (i) availability of our equipment, which we have built through acquisitions and capital expenditures, (ii) transportation costs, which are affected by fuel costs, (iii) utilization rates for our equipment, which are also affected by the level of our customers' drilling and production activities and competition, and our ability to relocate our equipment to areas in which oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are growing, (iv) the availability of qualified drivers (or alternatively, subcontractors) in the areas in which we operate, particularly in the Bakken, Marcellus, and Utica shale basins, (v) labor costs, which we saw increase during 2017, (vi) developments in governmental regulations, (vii) seasonality and weather events (viii) pricing and (ix) our health, safety and environmental performance record.\nThe following table summarizes our total revenues, (loss) income from continuing operations before income taxes, and (loss) income from continuing operations for five months ended December 31, 2017, the seven months ended July 31, 2017, and the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): Table 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Five Months Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Seven Months Ended July 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue - from predominantly oil shale basins (a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>241,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue - from predominantly natural gas shale basins (b)\n</td> <td>28,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>356,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) income from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(48,242\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(166,814\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(195,284\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>(47,895\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>168,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(167,621\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(195,167\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________________\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Represents revenues that are derived from predominantly oil-rich areas consisting of the Bakken, Eagle Ford, Mississippian and Tuscaloosa Marine Shale areas (prior to our substantial exit from the Mississippian and Tuscaloosa Marine shale basins during the three months ended March 31, 2015).

and transportation of fresh water and saltwater by our fleet of logistics assets and/or through water midstream assets owned by us to customer sites for use in drilling and completion activities and from customer sites to remove and dispose of flowback and produced water originating from oil and natural gas wells. Service revenue also includes fees for solids management services. Service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $159.0 million, up $19.1 million, or 13.6%, from $139.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Increases in drilling and completion activities in all divisions during 2017 led to higher service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The primary driver of the increase in demand in the basins we operate was a 73% increase in average operating drilling rigs from those operating in the prior year.\nRental Revenue\nRental revenue consists of fees charged to customers for use of equipment owned by us over the term of the rental period, as well as other fees charged to customers for items such as delivery and pickup. Rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $17.1 million, up $4.8 million, or 39.2%, from $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was the result of higher utilization of our rental fleet in all divisions in conjunction with the increase in drilling and completion activities in 2017 due to higher oil prices.\nDirect Operating Expenses\nDirect operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $148.1 million, compared to $129.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 14.2%. The increase in direct operating expenses is attributable to higher revenues as\na result of increased activities in all divisions. Additionally, direct operating expenses during the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, included a loss on the sale of assets of $5.7 million and $3.5 million, respectively.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $33.2 million, down $3.8 million from $37.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to lower legal and professional fees as the costs relating to the chapter 11 filing are included in Reorganization items, net\u201d on the consolidated statement of operations, while the costs incurred with the restructuring of our indebtedness in 2016 were included in general and administrative expenses. Offsetting the lower legal and professional fees were increased payroll costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $67.5 million, up $6.8 million from $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in our depreciable base as a result of fresh start accounting after emerging from chapter 11. The overall value of property, plant and equipment increased as a result of the valuations completed in coordination with fresh start accounting. Additionally, the assets were assigned shorter useful lives during the valuation process, thus increasing depreciation expense.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, management approved plans to sell certain assets located in both the Rocky Mountain and Southern divisions, including trucks and tanks. These assets qualified to be classified as assets held for sale and as a result the assets were recorded at the lower of net book value or fair value less costs to sell. This resulted in a long-lived asset impairment charge of $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, management approved plans to sell certain assets located in both the Northeast and Southern divisions, which resulted in a long-lived asset impairment charge of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Additionally, long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. During the year ended December 31, 2016, there were indicators that the assets in the Bakken, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Marcellus/Utica basins were not recoverable and as a result we recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $37.4 million.\nSee also Note 8 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further discussion.\nInterest Expense, net\nInterest expense, net during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $25.0 million compared to $54.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is primarily due to the reduction in our outstanding debt balance during 2017 as a result of the consummation of the Plan. As of December 31, 2017, our outstanding debt balance was $39.0 million, while as of December 31, 2016, outstanding debt was $487.6 million. The significant decrease in debt has dramatically lowered our annual interest expense. See Note 11 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further details.\nOther Income, net\nOther income, net was $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is primarily attributable to the gain on the sale of Underground Solutions Inc. (or UGSI\u201d) of $1.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 (see Note 21 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded gains of $4.3 million and $3.3 million, respectively, associated with the change in fair value of the derivative warrant liability. We issued warrants with derivative features upon our emergence from chapter 11 during the year ended December 31, 2017, and in connection with our debt restructuring during the year ended December 31, 2016. These instruments are accounted for as derivative liabilities with any decrease or increase in the estimated fair value recorded in Other income, net.\u201d See Note 12 and Note 13 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the warrants.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we executed two amendments to our Predecessor asset-based lending facility and as a result wrote-off $0.7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the Predecessor asset-based lending facility.\nReorganization Items, net\nExpenses, gains and losses directly associated with the chapter 11 proceedings are reported as Reorganization items, net\u201d in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017, which includes the net gain on debt discharge, professional and insurance fees, debtor in possession credit agreement financing costs, retention bonus payments, and other chapter 11 related items. See Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further details.\nIncome Taxes\nThe income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $0.7 million (a (0.6%) effective rate) compared to expense of $0.8 million (a (0.5%) effective rate) in the prior year. The effective tax rate in 2017 is primarily the result of federal alternative minimum tax and the change in valuation allowance attributable to long-lived assets. See Note 17 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional information on income taxes.\nLoss from Discontinued Operations\nLoss from discontinued operations in the years ended December 31, 2016 represents the final closing adjustments of TFI, our industrial solutions business, which was sold in April of 2015. Such loss, which is presented net of income taxes, was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. See Note 23 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional information.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31,

million, or 57.3%, from $327.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Continued lower drilling and completion activities in all divisions during 2016, as well as pricing pressures, led to lower service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015. The primary driver of the decreased demand in the basins we serve was a 57% decline in average operating oil rigs from those operating in the prior year.\nRental Revenue\nRental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $12.3 million, down $16.8 million, or 57.7%, from $29.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was the result of lower utilization of our rental fleet in all divisions in conjunction with the continued reduction in drilling and completion activities in 2016 due to depressed oil prices.\nDirect Operating Expenses\nDirect operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $129.6 million, compared to $279.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of 53.7%. The decrease in direct operating expenses is attributable to lower revenues as a result of decreased activities, as well as our continued focus on our cost-management initiatives. Additionally, direct operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016 included a loss on the sale of assets of $3.5 million, while the year ended December 31, 2015 included a gain on the sale of assets of $0.3 million.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $37.0 million, down $2.3 million from $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to lower compensation and benefit expenses as a result of headcount reductions in response to the continued decrease in drilling and completion activities, offset by $14.3 million in legal and professional fees incurred in connection with the out-of-court restructuring of our indebtedness in fiscal 2016.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $60.8 million, down $9.7 million from $70.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to a lower depreciable asset base as we have reduced capital spending and sold underutilized or non-core assets as a result of lower oil prices and decreased activities by our customers.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, management approved plans to sell certain assets located in both the Northeast and Southern divisions, including trucks, tanks, and a parcel of land. These assets qualified to be classified as assets held for sale and as a result the assets were recorded at the lower of net book value or fair value less costs to sell. This resulted in a long-lived asset impairment charge of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAdditionally, long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. During the year ended December 31, 2016, there were indicators that the assets in the Bakken, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Marcellus/Utica basins were not recoverable and as a result we recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $37.4 million.\nNo charges were recorded for the impairment of long-lived assets line for the year ended December 31, 2015. See also Note 8 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further discussion.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nWe recorded goodwill impairment charges of $104.7 million related to our Rocky Mountain division during the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of our annual impairment test, thereby eliminating all remaining goodwill on the consolidated balance sheet.\nOther, net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a charge totaling approximately $7.1 million to restructure our business in certain shale basins and reduce costs, including an exit from the Mississippian shale area and the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale logistics business. Included in the $7.1 million of restructuring charges is approximately $5.9 million for the impairment of certain assets in the Mississippian shale area.\nInterest Expense, net\nInterest expense, net during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $54.5 million compared to $49.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily due to the restructuring of our indebtedness during the year ended December 31, 2016. As part of the debt restructuring, a portion of our 2018 Notes were exchanged for new 2021 Notes whereby the interest due on October 15, 2016 was payable in kind at an annual rate of 12.5%. Additionally, we entered into a new term loan with interest payable in kind at 13% compounded monthly.\nOther Income, net\nOther income, net was $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is attributable to the gain on the sale of UGSI of $1.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. Additionally, we recorded a $3.3 million gain associated with the change in fair value of the derivative warrant liability. We issued warrants with derivative features in connection with our debt restructuring during the year ended December 31, 2016. These instruments are accounted for as derivative liabilities with any decrease or increase in the estimated fair value recorded in Other income, net.\u201d\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we executed two amendments to our Predecessor asset-based lending facility and as a result wrote-off $0.7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the Predecessor asset-based lending facility. During the year ended December 31, 2015, as a result of two amendments to our Predecessor asset-based lending facility, we wrote-off a portion of the unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the Predecessor asset-based lending facility of approximately $2.1 million.\nIncome Taxes\nThe income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $0.8 million (a (0.5%) effective rate) compared to a benefit of $0.1 million (a near zero effective rate) in the prior year. The effective tax rate in 2016 is primarily the result of federal alternative minimum tax and the change in valuation allowance attributable to long-lived assets. See Note 17 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional information on income taxes.\nLoss from Discontinued Operations\nLoss from discontinued operations in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 represents the financial results and final closing adjustments of TFI, our industrial solutions business, which was sold in April of 2015. Such loss, which is presented net of income taxes, was $1.2 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Note 23 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional information.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows and Liquidity\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our primary sources of capital for 2017 have included cash generated by our operations, asset sales, restructuring transactions including borrowings from our Predecessor term loan, debtor in possession financing, Successor first lien term loan, Successor second lien term loan, and Successor revolving facility. At December 31, 2017, our total indebtedness was $39.0 million, and we had cash and cash equivalents of $5.5 million with $9.3 million of net availability under the Successor revolving facility and $5.7 million available as a delayed draw under the Successor second lien term loan.\nIn order to address our prior liquidity issues due to the prolonged depression in oil and natural gas prices, on May 1, 2017, the Nuverra Parties commenced the chapter 11 cases and filed the Plan, which was subsequently amended. On July 25, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the amended Plan. The Plan became effective on August 7, 2017. See the Emergence from Chapter 11 Reorganization\u201d discussion later in this section for further details on the Restructuring and the Plan.\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash from continuing operations for the five months ended December 31, 2017, seven months ended July 31, 2017, and the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): Table 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Five Months Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Seven Months Ended\nJuly 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by continuing operations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,461\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18,949\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26,251\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,451\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,632\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26,796\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(93,118\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,705\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(38,315\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $5.5 million, an increase of $4.5 million from December 31, 2016. The primary reason for the increase in cash and cash equivalents is due to the termination of our Predecessor Revolving Facility which required a daily cash sweep of our collection lockbox and certain depository accounts, the proceeds of which were required to be applied against the outstanding balance of the Predecessor asset-based lending facility. Our Successor revolving facility does not impose a similar restriction on our cash.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $25.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net income from continuing operations, after adjustments for non-cash items, used cash of $15.6 million as compared to $31.1 million in 2016, as described below. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used $9.8 million primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable as a result of higher activity levels and billings in the current year, offset by lower accrued liabilities. The non-cash items and other adjustments included the non-cash reorganization items of $218.6 million arising primarily from the gain on debt discharge due to the consummation of the Plan, a $4.3 million gain resulting from the change in the fair value of the derivative warrant liability, a $0.6 million change in deferred income taxes and a $0.1 million gain on the sale of UGSI, all offset by $67.5 million of depreciation expense and amortization of intangible assets, $11.9 million in accrued interest added to debt principal, $4.9 million in impairment of long-lived assets, a $5.4 million loss on the disposal of property, plant and equipment, amortization of debt issuance costs of $2.1 million, stock-based compensation of $1.1 million, and bad debt expense of $0.9 million.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $26.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net loss from continuing operations, after adjustments for non-cash items, used cash of $31.1 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $4.8 million primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable as a result of lower activity levels and billings in the current year, offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The non-cash items and other adjustments resulted in $60.8 million of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, $42.2 million in impairment of long-lived assets, $26.7 million in accrued interest added to debt principal, amortization of debt issuance costs of $6.2 million, a $3.5 million loss on the disposal of property, plant and equipment, stock-based compensation of $1.1 million, and the write-off of debt issuance costs of $0.7 million, partially offset by a $3.3 million gain resulting from the change in the fair value of the derivative warrant liability and a $1.7 million gain on the sale of UGSI.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $49.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The net loss from continuing operations, after adjustments for non-cash items, used cash of $6.3 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided cash of $56.1 million primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable due to a focused effort on collections and lower activity levels. The non-cash items and other adjustments included $104.7 million in impairment of goodwill, $70.5 million of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, $5.9 million in impairment of long-lived assets, amortization of debt issuance costs of $4.8 million, and the write-off of debt issuance costs of $2.1 million.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which primarily consisted of $7.1 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment, offset by $5.4 million of purchases of property, plant and equipment.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 which consisted primarily of $10.7 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment, $5.0 million in proceeds from the sale of UGSI, and a $2.8 million decrease in restricted cash due primarily to the release of funds from escrow as a result of the completion of the\npost-closing working capital reconciliation related to the sale of TFI, partially offset by $3.8 million of purchases of property, plant and equipment.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $68.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and consisted primarily of $78.9 million of proceeds from the sale of TFI, $12.7 million in proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment, offset by $19.2 million of purchases of property, plant and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and was primarily comprised of $36.1 million of proceeds from the Successor first and second lien term loans, $15.7 million in proceeds from the Predecessor term loan, $6.9 million in proceeds from the debtor in possession term loan, offset by $23.2 million in net repayments on our Predecessor asset-based lending facility and $5.2 million in payments under capital leases, notes payable and other financing activities.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $26.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and was primarily due to $79.2 million of net repayments on the Predecessor asset-based lending facility, offset by $55.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of the Predecessor term loan.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $93.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and was primarily a result of using the proceeds received from the sale of TFI to make $81.6 million in payments on our Predecessor asset-based lending facility. Additionally, we used cash of $11.2 million for payments under capital leases, notes payable and other financing activities, and $0.2 million for payments of debt issuance costs.\nCapital Expenditures\nCash required for capital expenditures (related to continuing operations) for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $5.4 million compared to $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to expenditures to extend the useful life and productivity on our fleet of trucks, tanks, equipment and disposal wells. Although we did not enter into any new capital leases during the year ended December 31, 2017, historically, a portion of our transportation-related capital requirements were financed through capital leases, which are excluded from the capital expenditures figures cited in the preceding sentences. We continue to focus on improving the utilization of our existing assets and optimizing the allocation of resources in the various shale basins in which we operate. Our capital expenditures program is subject to market conditions, including customer activity levels, commodity prices, industry capacity and specific customer needs. Our planned capital expenditures for 2018 are expected to be financed through cash flow from operations, borrowings under our Successor credit facility and term loan facilities, capital leases, or a combination of the foregoing.\nIndebtedness\nPrior to the consummation of the Plan which provided for the restructuring of our indebtedness, we were highly leveraged and a substantial portion of our liquidity needs resulted from debt service requirements and from funding our costs of operations and capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2017, we had $39.0 million of indebtedness outstanding, consisting of $14.3 million under the Successor First Lien Term Loan, $21.0 million under the Successor Second Lien Term Loan, and $3.8 million of capital leases for vehicle financings.\nIn connection with the our emergence from the chapter 11 cases, all of the following agreements, and all outstanding interests and obligations thereunder, were terminated on the Effective Date:\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended through the Fourteenth Amendment thereto, dated as of February 3, 2014, by and among Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( Wells Fargo\u201d), the lenders named therein, and the Company (the Predecessor Revolving Facility\u201d);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Term Loan Credit Agreement, as amended through the Ninth Amendment thereto, dated as of April 15, 2016, by and among Wilmington, the lenders named therein, and the Company (the Predecessor Term Loan\u201d);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Indenture governing the Company's 2018 Notes, dated April 10, 2012, among the Company, its subsidiaries, and The Bank of New York Mellon, N.A.

See Note 25 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further details.\nFirst Lien Credit Agreements\nOn the Effective Date, pursuant to the Plan, the Company entered into a $45.0 million First Lien Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) by and among the lenders party thereto (the Credit Agreement Lenders\u201d), ACF FinCo I, LP, as administrative agent (the Credit Agreement Agent\u201d), and the Company. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Credit Agreement Lenders agreed to extend to the Company a $30.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Successor Revolving Facility\u201d) and a $15.0 million senior secured term loan facility (the Successor First Lien Term Loan\u201d) (i) to repay obligations outstanding under the Predecessor Revolving Facility and debtor in possession asset based lending facility, (ii) to make certain payments as provided in the Plan, (iii) to pay costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Plan, and (iv) for working capital, transaction expenses, and other general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement also contains an accordion feature that provides for an increase in availability of up to an additional $20.0 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions contained in the Credit Agreement.\nThe Successor Revolving Facility and the Successor First Lien Term Loan mature on August 7, 2020, at which time the Company must repay the outstanding principal amount of the Successor Revolving Facility and the Successor First Lien Term Loan, together with interest accrued and unpaid thereon. The Successor Revolving Facility may be repaid and, subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, reborrowed at any time during the term of the Credit Agreement. The principal amount of the Successor First Lien Term Loan shall be repaid in installments of $178.6 thousand beginning on September 1, 2017 and the first day of each calendar month thereafter prior to maturity. Interest on the Successor Revolving Facility accrues at an annual rate equal to the LIBOR Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus 5.25%, and interest on the Successor First Lien Term Loan accrues at an annual rate equal to the LIBOR Rate plus 7.25%; however, if there is an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement), the Credit Agreement Agent, in its sole discretion, may increase the applicable interest rate at a per annum rate equal to three percentage points above the annual rate otherwise applicable thereunder.\nThe Credit Agreement also contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant, as well as other terms and conditions that are customary for revolving credit facilities and term loans of this type. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants.\nSecond Lien Term Loan Credit Agreement\nOn the Effective Date, pursuant to the Plan, the Company also entered into a Second Lien Term Loan Credit Agreement (the Second Lien Term Loan Agreement\u201d) by and among the lenders party thereto (the Second Lien Term Loan Lenders\u201d), Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB ( Wilmington\u201d), as administrative agent (the Second Lien Term Loan Agent\u201d), and the Company. Pursuant to the Second Lien Term Loan Agreement, the Second Lien Term Loan Lenders agreed to extend to the Company a $26.8 million second lien term loan facility (the Successor Second Lien Term Loan\u201d), of which $21.1 million was advanced on the Effective Date and up to an additional $5.7 million ( Delayed Draw Term Loan\u201d) is available at the request of the Company after the closing date subject to the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions specified in the Second Lien Term Loan Agreement. The Second Lien Term Loan Lenders extended the Successor Second Lien Term Loan, among other things, (i) to repay obligations outstanding under the Predecessor Revolving Facility and debtor in possession asset based revolving facility, (ii) to make certain payments as provided in the Plan, (iii) to pay costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Plan, and (iv) for working capital, transaction expenses and other general corporate purposes.\nThe Successor Second Lien Term Loan matures on February 7, 2021, at which time the Company must repay all outstanding obligations under the Successor Second Lien Term Loan. The principal amount of the Successor Second Lien Term Loan shall be repaid in installments of $263.2 thousand beginning on October 1, 2017, and the first day of each fiscal quarter thereafter prior to maturity, with such amount to be proportionally increased as the result of the incurrence of a Delayed Draw Term Loan. Interest on the Successor Second Lien Term Loan accrues at an annual rate equal to 11.0%, with 5.5% payable in cash and 5.5% payable in kind prior to February 7, 2018 (or such later date as the Company may select in accordance with the terms of the Second Lien Term Loan Agreement) and, on or after February 7, 2018 (or such later date), at an annual rate equal to 11.0%,\npayable in cash, in arrears, on the first day of each month. However, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default (as defined in the Second Lien Term Loan Agreement) due to a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy filing, automatically, or any other Event of Default, at the election of the Second Lien Term Loan Agent, the Successor Second Lien Term Loan and all obligations thereunder shall bear interest at an annual rate equal to three percentage points above the annual rate otherwise applicable thereunder.\nThe Second Lien Term Loan Agreement also contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant, as well as other terms and conditions that are customary for term loans of this type. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants.\nSecurity Agreements\nOn August 7, 2017, in connection with the Credit Agreement, the Company entered into (i) a First Lien Guaranty and Security Agreement by and among the Company, the other grantors party thereto, and the Credit Agreement Agent to grant a first lien security interest in all of such grantor's as collateral provided therein to secure the obligations under the Credit Agreement and (ii) a First Lien Trademark Security Agreement, by and among the Company, the other grantors party thereto, and the Credit Agreement Agent to grant a first lien security interest in certain trademark collateral as provided therein to secure obligations under the Credit Agreement.\nOn August 7, 2017, in connection with the Second Lien Term Loan Agreement, the Company entered into (i) a Second Lien Guaranty and Security Agreement by and among the Company, the other grantors party thereto, and the Second Lien Term Loan Agent to grant a second lien security interest in all of such grantor's collateral as provided therein to secure the obligations under the Second Lien Term Loan Agreement and (ii) a Second Lien Trademark Security Agreement, by and among the Company, the other grantors party thereto, and the Second Lien Term Loan Agent to grant a second lien security interest in certain trademark collateral as provided therein to secure obligations under the Second Lien Term Loan Agreement.\nIntercreditor Agreement and Intercompany Subordination Agreement\nOn August 7, 2017, in connection with the Credit Agreement and the Second Lien Term Loan Agreement, the Company acknowledged the terms and conditions under a Subordination and Intercreditor Agreement (the Intercreditor Agreement\u201d), dated as of August 7, 2017, by and among the Credit Agreement Agent and the Second Lien Term Loan Agent to set forth the terms and conditions of the relationship between the lenders and the secured parties under the Credit Agreement and Second Lien Term Loan Agreement. On August 7, 2017, the Company entered into an Intercompany Subordination Agreement (the Intercompany Agreement\u201d), dated as of August 7, 2017, by and among the Company and the other obligors named therein to agree to subordinate its indebtedness to the Credit Agreement Lenders and the Second Lien Term Loan Lenders.\nEmergence from Chapter 11 Reorganization\nOn May 1, 2017, the Nuverra Parties filed voluntary petitions under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court to pursue the Plan. On July 25, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Confirmation Order confirming the Plan. On July 26, 2017, David Hargreaves, an individual holder of our Predecessor 2018 Notes, appealed the Confirmation Order to the District Court for the District of Delaware (the District Court\u201d) and filed a motion for a stay pending appeal from the District Court. On August 3, 2017, the District Court entered an order denying the motion for a stay pending appeal. Notwithstanding the denial of the motion for stay pending appeal, Hargreaves' appeal remains pending in the District Court.\nThe Nuverra Parties emerged from the bankruptcy proceedings on the Effective Date. Although the Nuverra Parties emerged from bankruptcy on the Effective Date, the bankruptcy cases will remain pending until closed by the Bankruptcy Court.\nOn the Effective Date, the Company:\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adopted a Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Third Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Appointed three new members to the Company's Board of Directors to replace the directors of the Company who were deemed to have resigned on the Effective Date;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Entered into the Credit Agreement, pursuant to which the Credit Agreement Lenders agreed to extend the Company the Successor Revolving Facility and the Successor First Lien Term Loan;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Entered into the Second Lien Term Loan Credit Agreement, pursuant to which the Second Lien Term Loan Lenders extended the Company the Successor Second Lien Term Loan;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Issued 7,900,000 shares of common stock of the reorganized Company to the holders of the Predecessor Company's 2021 Notes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Issued 100,000 shares of common stock of the reorganized Company to the Affected Classes (as defined in the Plan);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Issued 3,695,580 shares of common stock of the reorganized Company to holders of Supporting Noteholder Term Loan Claims (as defined in the Plan) and to the Credit Agreement Lenders for the Exit Financing Commitment Fee (as defined in the Plan);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Issued 118,137 warrants to purchase common stock of the reorganized Company, with an exercise price of $39.82 per share and an exercise term expiring seven years from the Effective Date;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with certain holders of the reorganized Company's common stock party thereto;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Entered into a Warrant Agreement with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company LLC, the Company's transfer agent;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Paid in full in cash all administrative expense claims, priority tax claims, priority claims, and debtor in possession revolving credit facility claims;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Paid all undisputed, non-contingent customer, vendor, or other obligations not specifically compromised under the Plan; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Assumed Mark D.

The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and changes in these judgments and estimates may impact future results of operations and financial condition. For additional discussion of our accounting policies see Note 3 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable are recognized and carried at the original invoice amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts. We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected uncollectability of trade receivables for both billed and unbilled receivables on our service and rental revenues. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of prospective and existing customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer's current credit worthiness, as determined by a review of their current credit information. In addition, we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified. Inherent in the assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts are certain judgments and estimates including, among others, the customer's willingness or ability to pay, our compliance with customer invoicing requirements, the effect of general economic conditions and the ongoing relationship with the customer. Additionally, if the financial condition of a specific customer or our general customer base were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make\npayments, additional allowances may be required. Accounts receivable are presented net of allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately $1.9 million, $1.7 million and $3.5 million at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangible Assets with Finite Useful Lives\nWe review long-lived assets including intangible assets with finite useful lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a long-lived asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. If an impairment indicator is present, we evaluate recoverability by comparing the estimated future cash flows of the asset group, on an undiscounted basis, to their carrying values. The asset group represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is present. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, the impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the long-lived asset (or asset group). Our determination that an event or change in circumstance has occurred potentially indicating the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable generally includes but is not limited to one or more of the following: (1) a deterioration in an asset's financial performance compared to historical results, (2) a shortfall in an asset's financial performance compared to forecasted results, (3) changes affecting the utility and estimated future demands for the asset, (4) a significant decrease in the market price of an asset, (5) a current expectation that a long-lived asset will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life, (6) a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset (asset group) is being used or in its physical condition, and (7) declining operations and severe changes in projected cash flows.\nWe recorded total impairment charges of $4.9 million for long-lived assets classified as held for sale during the year ended December 31, 2017, which was included in Impairment of long-lived assets\u201d in the consolidated statement of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded total impairment charges for long-lived assets of $42.2 million. These charges were due to the carrying value of assets for certain basins not being recoverable, as well as for assets that were classified as held for sale during 2016. We recorded long-lived asset impairment charges associated with our restructuring of $5.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, which was included in Other, net\u201d in the consolidated statement of operations (See Note 9). We could recognize future impairments to the extent adverse events or changes in circumstances result in conditions in which long-lived assets are not recoverable. See Note 8 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our impairment charges.\nIncome Taxes and Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets\nWe are subject to federal income taxes and state income taxes in those jurisdictions in which we operate. We exercise judgment with regard to income taxes in interpreting whether expenses are deductible in accordance with federal income tax and state income tax codes, estimating annual effective federal and state income tax rates and assessing whether deferred tax assets are, more likely than not, expected to be realized. The accuracy of these judgments impacts the amount of income tax expense we recognize each period.\nWith regard to the valuation of deferred tax assets, we record valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount considered more likely than not to be realized. All available evidence is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is needed. See Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further information regarding the valuation of our deferred tax assets and the impact of new legislation.\nFuture realization of the tax benefit of an existing deductible temporary difference or carryforward ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the tax law. We have had significant pretax losses in recent years. Accordingly, we do not have income in carryback years. These cumulative losses also present significant negative evidence about the likelihood of income in carryforward periods.\nFuture reversals of existing taxable temporary differences are another source of taxable income that is used in this analysis. As a result, deferred tax liabilities in excess of deferred tax assets generally will provide support for recognition of deferred tax assets. However, most of our deferred tax assets are associated with net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards, which statutorily expire after a specified number of years; therefore, we compare the estimated timing of these taxable timing difference reversals with the scheduled expiration of our NOL carryforwards, considering any limitations on use of NOL carryforwards, and record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that would expire unused.\nAs a matter of law, we are subject to examination by federal and state taxing authorities. We have estimated and provided for income taxes in accordance with settlements reached with the Internal Revenue Service in prior audits. Although we believe that the amounts reflected in our tax returns substantially comply with the applicable federal and state tax regulations, both the IRS and the various state taxing authorities can take positions contrary to our position based on their interpretation of the law. A\ntax position that is challenged by a taxing authority could result in an adjustment to our income tax liabilities and related tax provision.\nWe measure and record tax contingency accruals in accordance with GAAP which prescribes a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a return. Only positions meeting the more likely than not\u201d recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized. A tax position is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenues in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 605 (ASC 605 Revenue Recognition\u201d) and Staff Accounting Bulletin No 104, and accordingly all of the following criteria must be met for revenues to be recognized: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price to the buyer is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.\nThe majority of our revenues are from the transportation of fresh and saltwater by our trucks or through temporary or permanent water transport pipelines to customer sites for use in drilling and hydraulic fracturing activities and from customer sites to remove and dispose of flowback and produced water originating from oil and natural gas wells. Revenues are also generated through fees charged for disposal of oilfield wastes in our landfill, disposal of fluids in our disposal wells and from the rental of tanks and other equipment. Certain customers are under contract with us to utilize our saltwater pipeline. Transportation and disposal rates are generally based on a fixed fee per barrel of disposal water or, in certain circumstances transportation is based on an hourly rate. Revenue is recognized based on the number of barrels transported or disposed of at hourly rates for transportation services, depending on the customer contract. Rates for other services are based on negotiated rates with our customers and revenue is recognized when the services have been performed.\nEnvironmental and Legal Contingencies\nWe have established liabilities for environmental and legal contingencies. We record a loss contingency for these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining the liability, we consider a number of factors including, but not limited to, the jurisdiction of the claim, related claims, insurance coverage when insurance covers the type of claim and our historic outcomes in similar matters, if applicable. A significant amount of judgment and the use of estimates are required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters. The determination of liabilities for these contingencies is reviewed periodically to ensure that we have accrued the proper level of expense. The liability balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues, including the effect of any applicable insurance coverage for these matters. While we believe that the amount accrued is adequate, future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations.\nWe record obligations to retire tangible, long-lived assets on our balance sheet as liabilities, which are recorded at a discount when we incur the liability. A certain amount of judgment is involved in estimating the future cash flows of such obligations, as well as the timing of these cash flows. If our assumptions and estimates on the amount or timing of the future cash flows change, it could potentially have a negative impact on our earnings.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee the Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\u201d section of Note 3 on Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for a complete description of recent accounting standards which may be applicable to our operations.

judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and changes in these judgments and estimates may impact future results of operations and financial condition. For additional discussion of our accounting policies see Note 3 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a charge totaling approximately $7.1 million to restructure our business in certain shale basins and reduce costs, including an exit from the Mississippian shale area and the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale logistics business. Included in the $7.1 million of restructuring charges is approximately $5.9 million for the impairment of certain assets in the Mississippian shale area.\nThe Second Lien Term Loan Agreement also contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant, as well as other terms and conditions that are customary for term loans of this type. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants.\nUpon emergence, we elected to apply fresh start accounting effective July 31, 2017, to coincide with the timing of our normal accounting period close. Refer to Note 5 on Fresh Start Accounting\u201d in the Notes to the Financial Statements for additional information on the selection of this date. As a result of the application of fresh start accounting, as well as the effects of the implementation of the Plan, a new entity for financial reporting purposes was created, and as such, the condensed consolidated financial statements on or after August 1, 2017, are not comparable with the condensed consolidated financial statements prior to that date.\nOn the Effective Date, all of the following agreements, and all outstanding interests and obligations thereunder, were terminated:\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\n \u2022 Oil shale areas: includes our operations in the Bakken and Eagle Ford Shale areas. \n \u2022 Debtor-in-Possession Credit Agreement, dated as of April 30, 2017 and effective as of May 3, 2017, by and among the Company, the lenders party thereto, Wells Fargo, and other agents party thereto (the DIP Credit Agreement\u201d); and \nSecurity Agreements\nCash Flows and Liquidity\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we executed two amendments to our Predecessor asset-based lending facility and as a result wrote-off $0.7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the Predecessor asset-based lending facility. During the year ended December 31, 2015, as a result of two amendments to our Predecessor asset-based lending facility, we wrote-off a portion of the unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the Predecessor asset-based lending facility of approximately $2.1 million.\nThe majority of our revenues are from the transportation of fresh and saltwater by our trucks or through temporary or permanent water transport pipelines to customer sites for use in drilling and hydraulic fracturing activities and from customer sites to remove and dispose of flowback and produced water originating from oil and natural gas wells. Revenues are also generated through fees charged for disposal of oilfield wastes in our landfill, disposal of fluids in our disposal wells and from the rental of tanks and other equipment. Certain customers are under contract with us to utilize our saltwater pipeline. Transportation and disposal rates are generally based on a fixed fee per barrel of disposal water or, in certain circumstances transportation is based on an hourly rate. Revenue is recognized based on the number of barrels transported or disposed of at hourly rates for transportation services, depending on the customer contract. Rates for other services are based on negotiated rates with our customers and revenue is recognized when the services have been performed.\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $67.5 million, up $6.8 million from $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in our depreciable base as a result of fresh start accounting after emerging from chapter 11. The overall value of property, plant and equipment increased as a result of the valuations completed in coordination with fresh start accounting. Additionally, the assets were assigned shorter useful lives during the valuation process, thus increasing depreciation expense.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our primary sources of capital for 2017 have included cash generated by our operations, asset sales, restructuring transactions including borrowings from our Predecessor term loan, debtor in possession financing, Successor first lien term loan, Successor second lien term loan, and Successor revolving facility. At December 31, 2017, our total indebtedness was $39.0 million, and we had cash and cash equivalents of $5.5 million with $9.3 million of net availability under the Successor revolving facility and $5.7 million available as a delayed draw under the Successor second lien term loan.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $26.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net loss from continuing operations, after adjustments for non-cash items, used cash of $31.1 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $4.8 million primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable as a result of lower activity levels and billings in the current year, offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The non-cash items and other adjustments resulted in $60.8 million of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, $42.2 million in impairment of long-lived assets, $26.7 million in accrued interest added to debt principal, amortization of debt issuance costs of $6.2 million, a $3.5 million loss on the disposal of property, plant and equipment, stock-based compensation of $1.1 million, and the write-off of debt issuance costs of $0.7 million, partially offset by a $3.3 million gain resulting from the change in the fair value of the derivative warrant liability and a $1.7 million gain on the sale of UGSI.\npayable in cash, in arrears, on the first day of each month. However, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default (as defined in the Second Lien Term Loan Agreement) due to a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy filing, automatically, or any other Event of Default, at the election of the Second Lien Term Loan Agent, the Successor Second Lien Term Loan and all obligations thereunder shall bear interest at an annual rate equal to three percentage points above the annual rate otherwise applicable thereunder.\n (5) Represents estimated future costs related to the closure and/or remediation of our disposal wells and landfill. As we are uncertain as to when these future costs will be paid, the majority of the obligation has been presented in the more than five years column. \nThe foregoing is a summary of the substantive provisions of the Plan and the transactions related to and contemplated thereunder and is not intended to be a complete description of, or a substitute for, a full and complete reading of, the Plan and the other documents referred to above.\nReferences to Successor\u201d or Successor Company\u201d refer to the financial position and results of operations of the reorganized Company subsequent to July 31, 2017.

As of December 31, 2017, we had $39.0 million of indebtedness outstanding, consisting of $14.3 million under the Successor First Lien Term Loan, $21.0 million under the Successor Second Lien Term Loan, and $3.8 million of capital leases for vehicle financings.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 which consisted primarily of $10.7 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment, $5.0 million in proceeds from the sale of UGSI, and a $2.8 million decrease in restricted cash due primarily to the release of funds from escrow as a result of the completion of the\nWith regard to the valuation of deferred tax assets, we record valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount considered more likely than not to be realized. All available evidence is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is needed. See Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further information regarding the valuation of our deferred tax assets and the impact of new legislation.\nAccounts receivable are recognized and carried at the original invoice amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts. We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected uncollectability of trade receivables for both billed and unbilled receivables on our service and rental revenues. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of prospective and existing customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer's current credit worthiness, as determined by a review of their current credit information. In addition, we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified. Inherent in the assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts are certain judgments and estimates including, among others, the customer's willingness or ability to pay, our compliance with customer invoicing requirements, the effect of general economic conditions and the ongoing relationship with the customer. Additionally, if the financial condition of a specific customer or our general customer base were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFinancing Activities\ntax position that is challenged by a taxing authority could result in an adjustment to our income tax liabilities and related tax provision.\nWe measure and record tax contingency accruals in accordance with GAAP which prescribes a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a return. Only positions meeting the more likely than not\u201d recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized. A tax position is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nThe following table sets forth for each of the periods indicated our statements of operations data (dollars in thousands):\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangible Assets with Finite Useful Lives\npayments, additional allowances may be required. Accounts receivable are presented net of allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately $1.9 million, $1.7 million and $3.5 million at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively.\nDecember 31, 2015. The primary driver of the decreased demand in the basins we serve was a 57% decline in average operating oil rigs from those operating in the prior year.\nOn August 7, 2017, in connection with the Credit Agreement, the Company entered into (i) a First Lien Guaranty and Security Agreement by and among the Company, the other grantors party thereto, and the Credit Agreement Agent to grant a first lien security interest in all of such grantor's as collateral provided therein to secure the obligations under the Credit Agreement and (ii) a First Lien Trademark Security Agreement, by and among the Company, the other grantors party thereto, and the Credit Agreement Agent to grant a first lien security interest in certain trademark collateral as provided therein to secure obligations under the Credit Agreement.\nThe following table summarizes our total revenues, (loss) income from continuing operations before income taxes, and (loss) income from continuing operations for five months ended December 31, 2017, the seven months ended July 31, 2017, and the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): \nSee also Note 8 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further discussion.\n \u2022 Issued 118,137 warrants to purchase common stock of the reorganized Company, with an exercise price of $39.82 per share and an exercise term expiring seven years from the Effective Date; \nContractual Obligations\nWe record obligations to retire tangible, long-lived assets on our balance sheet as liabilities, which are recorded at a discount when we incur the liability. A certain amount of judgment is involved in estimating the future cash flows of such obligations, as well as the timing of these cash flows. If our assumptions and estimates on the amount or timing of the future cash flows change, it could potentially have a negative impact on our earnings.\n \u2022 2018 Notes Indenture; \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, management approved plans to sell certain assets located in both the Northeast and Southern divisions, which resulted in a long-lived asset impairment charge of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Additionally, long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. During the year ended December 31, 2016, there were indicators that the assets in the Bakken, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Marcellus/Utica basins were not recoverable and as a result we recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $37.4 million.\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash from continuing operations for the five months ended December 31, 2017, seven months ended July 31, 2017, and the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): \nLoss from discontinued operations in the years ended December 31, 2016 represents the final closing adjustments of TFI, our industrial solutions business, which was sold in April of 2015. Such loss, which is presented net of income taxes, was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. See Note 23 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional information.\nOther income, net was $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is primarily attributable to the gain on the sale of Underground Solutions Inc. (or UGSI\u201d) of $1.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 (see Note 21 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded gains of $4.3 million and $3.3 million, respectively, associated with the change in fair value of the derivative warrant liability. We issued warrants with derivative features upon our emergence from chapter 11 during the year ended December 31, 2017, and in connection with our debt restructuring during the year ended December 31, 2016. These instruments are accounted for as derivative liabilities with any decrease or increase in the estimated fair value recorded in Other income, net.\u201d See Note 12 and Note 13 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the warrants.\nWe have established liabilities for environmental and legal contingencies. We record a loss contingency for these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining the liability, we consider a number of factors including, but not limited to, the jurisdiction of the claim, related claims, insurance coverage when insurance covers the type of claim and our historic outcomes in similar matters, if applicable. A significant amount of judgment and the use of estimates are required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters. The determination of liabilities for these contingencies is reviewed periodically to ensure that we have accrued the proper level of expense. The liability balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues, including the effect of any applicable insurance coverage for these matters. While we believe that the amount accrued is adequate, future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations.\nThe following table sets forth for each of the periods indicated our statements of operations data (dollars in thousands):\nThe income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $0.8 million (a (0.5%) effective rate) compared to a benefit of $0.1 million (a near zero effective rate) in the prior year. The effective tax rate in 2016 is primarily the result of federal alternative minimum tax and the change in valuation allowance attributable to long-lived assets. See Note 17 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional information on income taxes.\nFuture realization of the tax benefit of an existing deductible temporary difference or carryforward ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the tax law. We have had significant pretax losses in recent years. Accordingly, we do not have income in carryback years. These cumulative losses also present significant negative evidence about the likelihood of income in carryforward periods.\nAdditionally, long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. During the year ended December 31, 2016, there were indicators that the assets in the Bakken, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Marcellus/Utica basins were not recoverable and as a result we recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $37.4 million.\nInvesting Activities\nRental Revenue\nAs of December 31, 2017, we did not have any material off-balance-sheet arrangements other than operating leases, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.\nInterest expense, net during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $25.0 million compared to $54.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is primarily due to the reduction in our outstanding debt balance during 2017 as a result of the consummation of the Plan. As of December 31, 2017, our outstanding debt balance was $39.0 million, while as of December 31, 2016, outstanding debt was $487.6 million. The significant decrease in debt has dramatically lowered our annual interest expense. See Note 11 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further details.\nReorganization Items, net\nFirst Lien Credit Agreements\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOn the Effective Date, pursuant to the Plan, the Company entered into a $45.0 million First Lien Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) by and among the lenders party thereto (the Credit Agreement Lenders\u201d), ACF FinCo I, LP, as administrative agent (the Credit Agreement Agent\u201d), and the Company. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Credit Agreement Lenders agreed to extend to the Company a $30.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Successor Revolving Facility\u201d) and a $15.0 million senior secured term loan facility (the Successor First Lien Term Loan\u201d) (i) to repay obligations outstanding under the Predecessor Revolving Facility and debtor in possession asset based lending facility, (ii) to make certain payments as provided in the Plan, (iii) to pay costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Plan, and (iv) for working capital, transaction expenses, and other general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement also contains an accordion feature that provides for an increase in availability of up to an additional $20.0 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions contained in the Credit Agreement.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $93.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and was primarily a result of using the proceeds received from the sale of TFI to make $81.6 million in payments on our Predecessor asset-based lending facility. Additionally, we used cash of $11.2 million for payments under capital leases, notes payable and other financing activities, and $0.2 million for payments of debt issuance costs.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $49.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The net loss from continuing operations, after adjustments for non-cash items, used cash of $6.3 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided cash of $56.1 million primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable due to a focused effort on collections and lower activity levels. The non-cash items and other adjustments included $104.7 million in impairment of goodwill, $70.5 million of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, $5.9 million in impairment of long-lived assets, amortization of debt issuance costs of $4.8 million, and the write-off of debt issuance costs of $2.1 million.\n\nAs a result of the cancellation of the Company's pre-Effective Date common stock on the Effective Date, the Company's pre-Effective Date common stock ceased trading on the OTC Pink under the symbol NESCQ.\u201d On October 12, 2017, the Company's post-Effective Date common stock was listed and began trading on the NYSE American under the symbol NES.\u201d See Risks Related to our Common Stock\u201d on page 22 of this Annual Report.\nIncome Taxes\nCompany Overview\n \u2022 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended through the Fourteenth Amendment thereto, dated as of February 3, 2014, by and among Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( Wells Fargo\u201d), the lenders named therein, and the Company (the Predecessor Revolving Facility\u201d); \n \u2022 Entered into the Second Lien Term Loan Credit Agreement, pursuant to which the Second Lien Term Loan Lenders extended the Company the Successor Second Lien Term Loan; \nNet cash used in operating activities was $25.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net income from continuing operations, after adjustments for non-cash items, used cash of $15.6 million as compared to $31.1 million in 2016, as described below. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used $9.8 million primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable as a result of higher activity levels and billings in the current year, offset by lower accrued liabilities. The non-cash items and other adjustments included the non-cash reorganization items of $218.6 million arising primarily from the gain on debt discharge due to the consummation of the Plan, a $4.3 million gain resulting from the change in the fair value of the derivative warrant liability, a $0.6 million change in deferred income taxes and a $0.1 million gain on the sale of UGSI, all offset by $67.5 million of depreciation expense and amortization of intangible assets, $11.9 million in accrued interest added to debt principal, $4.9 million in impairment of long-lived assets, a $5.4 million loss on the disposal of property, plant and equipment, amortization of debt issuance costs of $2.1 million, stock-based compensation of $1.1 million, and bad debt expense of $0.9 million.\nWe recorded total impairment charges of $4.9 million for long-lived assets classified as held for sale during the year ended December 31, 2017, which was included in Impairment of long-lived assets\u201d in the consolidated statement of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded total impairment charges for long-lived assets of $42.2 million. These charges were due to the carrying value of assets for certain basins not being recoverable, as well as for assets that were classified as held for sale during 2016. We recorded long-lived asset impairment charges associated with our restructuring of $5.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, which was included in Other, net\u201d in the consolidated statement of operations (See Note 9). We could recognize future impairments to the extent adverse events or changes in circumstances result in conditions in which long-lived assets are not recoverable. See Note 8 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our impairment charges.\n \u2022 Logistics and Wellsite Services: Delivery of freshwater to wellsites, freshwater procurement and transfer services, staging and storage of equipment and materials, rental of wellsite equipment, and construction services including wellpads. \nOur service offering focuses on providing comprehensive environmental and logistics management solutions within three primary groups:\n \u2022 Predecessor Term Loan; \nOn August 7, 2017, in connection with the Credit Agreement and the Second Lien Term Loan Agreement, the Company acknowledged the terms and conditions under a Subordination and Intercreditor Agreement (the Intercreditor Agreement\u201d), dated as of August 7, 2017, by and among the Credit Agreement Agent and the Second Lien Term Loan Agent to set forth the terms and conditions of the relationship between the lenders and the secured parties under the Credit Agreement and Second Lien Term Loan Agreement. On August 7, 2017, the Company entered into an Intercompany Subordination Agreement (the Intercompany Agreement\u201d), dated as of August 7, 2017, by and among the Company and the other obligors named therein to agree to subordinate its indebtedness to the Credit Agreement Lenders and the Second Lien Term Loan Lenders.\n (1) Principal payments are reflected when contractually required. \nThe Credit Agreement also contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant, as well as other terms and conditions that are customary for revolving credit facilities and term loans of this type. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants.\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $60.8 million, down $9.7 million from $70.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to a lower depreciable asset base as we have reduced capital spending and sold underutilized or non-core assets as a result of lower oil prices and decreased activities by our customers.\nLoss from Discontinued Operations\nLoss from discontinued operations in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 represents the financial results and final closing adjustments of TFI, our industrial solutions business, which was sold in April of 2015. Such loss, which is presented net of income taxes, was $1.2 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Note 23 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional information.\n \u2022 Predecessor Revolving Facility; \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, management approved plans to sell certain assets located in both the Northeast and Southern divisions, including trucks, tanks, and a parcel of land. These assets qualified to be classified as assets held for sale and as a result the assets were recorded at the lower of net book value or fair value less costs to sell. This resulted in a long-lived asset impairment charge of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates.\n \u2022 Entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with certain holders of the reorganized Company's common stock party thereto; \nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nIn order to address our liquidity issues due to the prolonged depression in oil and natural gas prices, on May 1, 2017, the Company and certain of its material subsidiaries (collectively with the Company, the Nuverra Parties\u201d) filed voluntary petitions under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code\u201d) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the Bankruptcy Court\u201d) to pursue prepackaged plans of reorganization (together, and as amended, the Plan\u201d). On July 25, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the Confirmation Order\u201d) confirming the Plan. The Plan became effective on August 7, 2017 (the Effective Date\u201d), when all remaining conditions to the effectiveness of the Plan were satisfied or waived. Although the Nuverra Parties emerged from bankruptcy on the Effective Date, the bankruptcy cases will remain pending until closed by the Bankruptcy Court.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $68.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and consisted primarily of $78.9 million of proceeds from the sale of TFI, $12.7 million in proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment, offset by $19.2 million of purchases of property, plant and equipment.\nExpenses, gains and losses directly associated with the chapter 11 proceedings are reported as Reorganization items, net\u201d in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017, which includes the net gain on debt discharge, professional and insurance fees, debtor in possession credit agreement financing costs, retention bonus payments, and other chapter 11 related items. See Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further details.\n \u2022 DIP Term Loan Agreement. \nIn connection with the our emergence from the chapter 11 cases, all of the following agreements, and all outstanding interests and obligations thereunder, were terminated on the Effective Date:\nOn August 7, 2017, in connection with the Second Lien Term Loan Agreement, the Company entered into (i) a Second Lien Guaranty and Security Agreement by and among the Company, the other grantors party thereto, and the Second Lien Term Loan Agent to grant a second lien security interest in all of such grantor's collateral as provided therein to secure the obligations under the Second Lien Term Loan Agreement and (ii) a Second Lien Trademark Security Agreement, by and among the Company, the other grantors party thereto, and the Second Lien Term Loan Agent to grant a second lien security interest in certain trademark collateral as provided therein to secure obligations under the Second Lien Term Loan Agreement.\nWe operate in shale basins where customer exploration and production ( E&P\u201d) activities are predominantly focused on shale oil and natural gas as follows:\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nService Revenue\nAs a matter of law, we are subject to examination by federal and state taxing authorities. We have estimated and provided for income taxes in accordance with settlements reached with the Internal Revenue Service in prior audits. Although we believe that the amounts reflected in our tax returns substantially comply with the applicable federal and state tax regulations, both the IRS and the various state taxing authorities can take positions contrary to our position based on their interpretation of the law. A\n \u2022 Assumed Mark D. Johnsrud's, the Company's former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Second Amended and Restated Employment Agreement, dated April 28, 2017 and entered into an Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with Joseph M. Crabb, the Company's Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer. \nDue to oil prices beginning to recover in 2017 from historic lows, drilling and completion activities increased in all of our active basins. We would expect continued stability in oil prices or further price growth to lead to increased drilling and completion activities by our customer base during 2018 when compared to 2017. Increased drilling and completion activities would likely lead to a higher demand for our services in 2018; however, there is no guarantee that oil prices will remain stable or increase, drilling and completion activities in basins will continue to increase, or we will see an increase in a demand for our services in 2018.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe recognize revenues in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 605 (ASC 605 Revenue Recognition\u201d) and Staff Accounting Bulletin No 104, and accordingly all of the following criteria must be met for revenues to be recognized: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price to the buyer is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we executed two amendments to our Predecessor asset-based lending facility and as a result wrote-off $0.7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the Predecessor asset-based lending facility.\nDirect operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $129.6 million, compared to $279.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of 53.7%. The decrease in direct operating expenses is attributable to lower revenues as a result of decreased activities, as well as our continued focus on our cost-management initiatives. Additionally, direct operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016 included a loss on the sale of assets of $3.5 million, while the year ended December 31, 2015 included a gain on the sale of assets of $0.3 million.\n \u2022 Paid in full in cash all administrative expense claims, priority tax claims, priority claims, and debtor in possession revolving credit facility claims; \n \u2022 Issued 100,000 shares of common stock of the reorganized Company to the Affected Classes (as defined in the Plan); \nIncome Taxes\nImpairment of Goodwill\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\n \u2022 Term Loan Credit Agreement, as amended through the Ninth Amendment thereto, dated as of April 15, 2016, by and among Wilmington, the lenders named therein, and the Company (the Predecessor Term Loan\u201d); \nIntercreditor Agreement and Intercompany Subordination Agreement\nFuture reversals of existing taxable temporary differences are another source of taxable income that is used in this analysis. As a result, deferred tax liabilities in excess of deferred tax assets generally will provide support for recognition of deferred tax assets. However, most of our deferred tax assets are associated with net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards, which statutorily expire after a specified number of years; therefore, we compare the estimated timing of these taxable timing difference reversals with the scheduled expiration of our NOL carryforwards, considering any limitations on use of NOL carryforwards, and record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that would expire unused.\nDepreciation and Amortization\n\n (b) Represents revenues that are derived from predominantly natural gas-rich areas consisting of the Marcellus, Utica, and Haynesville shale basins. Note that the Utica shale basin was previously included in the oil shale basins until the three months ended September 30, 2015 when it was reclassified as a natural gas shale basin. \nDirect Operating Expenses\nCash required for capital expenditures (related to continuing operations) for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $5.4 million compared to $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to expenditures to extend the useful life and productivity on our fleet of trucks, tanks, equipment and disposal wells. Although we did not enter into any new capital leases during the year ended December 31, 2017, historically, a portion of our transportation-related capital requirements were financed through capital leases, which are excluded from the capital expenditures figures cited in the preceding sentences. We continue to focus on improving the utilization of our existing assets and optimizing the allocation of resources in the various shale basins in which we operate. Our capital expenditures program is subject to market conditions, including customer activity levels, commodity prices, industry capacity and specific customer needs. Our planned capital expenditures for 2018 are expected to be financed through cash flow from operations, borrowings under our Successor credit facility and term loan facilities, capital leases, or a combination of the foregoing.\nNo charges were recorded for the impairment of long-lived assets line for the year ended December 31, 2015. See also Note 8 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further discussion.\nOther Income, net\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $33.2 million, down $3.8 million from $37.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to lower legal and professional fees as the costs relating to the chapter 11 filing are included in Reorganization items, net\u201d on the consolidated statement of operations, while the costs incurred with the restructuring of our indebtedness in 2016 were included in general and administrative expenses. Offsetting the lower legal and professional fees were increased payroll costs.\nOn May 1, 2017, the Nuverra Parties filed voluntary petitions under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court to pursue the Plan. On July 25, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Confirmation Order confirming the Plan. On July 26, 2017, David Hargreaves, an individual holder of our Predecessor 2018 Notes, appealed the Confirmation Order to the District Court for the District of Delaware (the District Court\u201d) and filed a motion for a stay pending appeal from the District Court. On August 3, 2017, the District Court entered an order denying the motion for a stay pending appeal. Notwithstanding the denial of the motion for stay pending appeal, Hargreaves' appeal remains pending in the District Court.\n \u2022 Paid all undisputed, non-contingent customer, vendor, or other obligations not specifically compromised under the Plan; and \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, management approved plans to sell certain assets located in both the Rocky Mountain and Southern divisions, including trucks and tanks. These assets qualified to be classified as assets held for sale and as a result the assets were recorded at the lower of net book value or fair value less costs to sell. This resulted in a long-lived asset impairment charge of $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nWe recorded goodwill impairment charges of $104.7 million related to our Rocky Mountain division during the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of our annual impairment test, thereby eliminating all remaining goodwill on the consolidated balance sheet.\nDirect Operating Expenses\nThe Nuverra Parties emerged from the bankruptcy proceedings on the Effective Date. Although the Nuverra Parties emerged from bankruptcy on the Effective Date, the bankruptcy cases will remain pending until closed by the Bankruptcy Court.\nThe income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $0.7 million (a (0.6%) effective rate) compared to expense of $0.8 million (a (0.5%) effective rate) in the prior year. The effective tax rate in 2017 is primarily the result of federal alternative minimum tax and the change in valuation allowance attributable to long-lived assets. See Note 17 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional information on income taxes.\nNuverra is a leading provider of comprehensive, full-cycle environmental solutions to customers focused on the development and ongoing production of oil and natural gas from shale formations in the United States. We provide one-stop, total environmental solutions and wellsite logistics management, including delivery, collection, treatment and disposal of solid and liquid materials that are used in and generated by the drilling, completion, and ongoing production of shale oil and natural gas.\nOther Income, net\nThe Successor Second Lien Term Loan matures on February 7, 2021, at which time the Company must repay all outstanding obligations under the Successor Second Lien Term Loan. The principal amount of the Successor Second Lien Term Loan shall be repaid in installments of $263.2 thousand beginning on October 1, 2017, and the first day of each fiscal quarter thereafter prior to maturity, with such amount to be proportionally increased as the result of the incurrence of a Delayed Draw Term Loan. Interest on the Successor Second Lien Term Loan accrues at an annual rate equal to 11.0%, with 5.5% payable in cash and 5.5% payable in kind prior to February 7, 2018 (or such later date as the Company may select in accordance with the terms of the Second Lien Term Loan Agreement) and, on or after February 7, 2018 (or such later date), at an annual rate equal to 11.0%,\nService revenue consists of fees charged to customers for the sale and transportation of fresh water and saltwater by our fleet of logistics assets and/or through water midstream assets owned by us to customer sites for use in drilling and completion activities and from customer sites to remove and dispose of flowback and produced water originating from oil and natural gas wells. Service revenue also includes fees for solids management services. Service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $159.0 million, up $19.1 million, or 13.6%, from $139.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Increases in drilling and completion activities in all divisions during 2017 led to higher service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The primary driver of the increase in demand in the basins we operate was a 73% increase in average operating drilling rigs from those operating in the prior year.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $26.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and was primarily due to $79.2 million of net repayments on the Predecessor asset-based lending facility, offset by $55.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of the Predecessor term loan.\n (4) Represents the $0.5 million due related to the acquisition of Ideal Oilfield Disposal LLC, which is payable when the Ideal settlement counterparties deliver the required permits and certificates necessary for the issuance of the second special waste disposal permit. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the settlement. \nService revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $139.9 million, down $187.8 million, or 57.3%, from $327.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Continued lower drilling and completion activities in all divisions during 2016, as well as pricing pressures, led to lower service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended\nInterest expense, net during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $54.5 million compared to $49.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily due to the restructuring of our indebtedness during the year ended December 31, 2016. As part of the debt restructuring, a portion of our 2018 Notes were exchanged for new 2021 Notes whereby the interest due on October 15, 2016 was payable in kind at an annual rate of 12.5%. Additionally, we entered into a new term loan with interest payable in kind at 13% compounded monthly.\nService Revenue\nResults of Operations\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nWe are subject to federal income taxes and state income taxes in those jurisdictions in which we operate. We exercise judgment with regard to income taxes in interpreting whether expenses are deductible in accordance with federal income tax and state income tax codes, estimating annual effective federal and state income tax rates and assessing whether deferred tax assets are, more likely than not, expected to be realized. The accuracy of these judgments impacts the amount of income tax expense we recognize each period.\nWe review long-lived assets including intangible assets with finite useful lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a long-lived asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. If an impairment indicator is present, we evaluate recoverability by comparing the estimated future cash flows of the asset group, on an undiscounted basis, to their carrying values. The asset group represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is present. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, the impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the long-lived asset (or asset group). Our determination that an event or change in circumstance has occurred potentially indicating the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable generally includes but is not limited to one or more of the following: (1) a deterioration in an asset's financial performance compared to historical results, (2) a shortfall in an asset's financial performance compared to forecasted results, (3) changes affecting the utility and estimated future demands for the asset, (4) a significant decrease in the market price of an asset, (5) a current expectation that a long-lived asset will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life, (6) a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset (asset group) is being used or in its physical condition, and (7) declining operations and severe changes in projected cash flows.\nOn the Effective Date, pursuant to the Plan, the Company also entered into a Second Lien Term Loan Credit Agreement (the Second Lien Term Loan Agreement\u201d) by and among the lenders party thereto (the Second Lien Term Loan Lenders\u201d), Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB ( Wilmington\u201d), as administrative agent (the Second Lien Term Loan Agent\u201d), and the Company. Pursuant to the Second Lien Term Loan Agreement, the Second Lien Term Loan Lenders agreed to extend to the Company a $26.8 million second lien term loan facility (the Successor Second Lien Term Loan\u201d), of which $21.1 million was advanced on the Effective Date and up to an additional $5.7 million ( Delayed Draw Term Loan\u201d) is available at the request of the Company after the closing date subject to the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions specified in the Second Lien Term Loan Agreement. The Second Lien Term Loan Lenders extended the Successor Second Lien Term Loan, among other things, (i) to repay obligations outstanding under the Predecessor Revolving Facility and debtor in possession asset based revolving facility, (ii) to make certain payments as provided in the Plan, (iii) to pay costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Plan, and (iv) for working capital, transaction expenses and other general corporate purposes.\nOur results are driven by demand for our services, which are in turn affected by E&P spending trends in the shale basins in which we operate, in particular the level of drilling and completion activities (which impacts the amount of environmental waste products being managed) and active wells (which impacts the amount of produced water being managed). In general, drilling and completion activities in the oil and natural gas industry is affected by the market prices (or anticipated prices) for those commodities.\n \u2022 Water Midstream: Collection and transportation of produced water from wellsites to disposal network via trucking or a fixed pipeline system, supplying freshwater for drilling and completion via pipeline system, gathering systems for collection and transportation of flowback and produced water to disposal wells. \n (3) Represents operating leases primarily for facilities, vehicles and rental equipment. \nRental revenue consists of fees charged to customers for use of equipment owned by us over the term of the rental period, as well as other fees charged to customers for items such as delivery and pickup. Rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $17.1 million, up $4.8 million, or 39.2%, from $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was the result of higher utilization of our rental fleet in all divisions in conjunction with the increase in drilling and completion activities in 2017 due to higher oil prices.\nThe Successor Revolving Facility and the Successor First Lien Term Loan mature on August 7, 2020, at which time the Company must repay the outstanding principal amount of the Successor Revolving Facility and the Successor First Lien Term Loan, together with interest accrued and unpaid thereon. The Successor Revolving Facility may be repaid and, subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, reborrowed at any time during the term of the Credit Agreement. The principal amount of the Successor First Lien Term Loan shall be repaid in installments of $178.6 thousand beginning on September 1, 2017 and the first day of each calendar month thereafter prior to maturity. Interest on the Successor Revolving Facility accrues at an annual rate equal to the LIBOR Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus 5.25%, and interest on the Successor First Lien Term Loan accrues at an annual rate equal to the LIBOR Rate plus 7.25%; however, if there is an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement), the Credit Agreement Agent, in its sole discretion, may increase the applicable interest rate at a per annum rate equal to three percentage points above the annual rate otherwise applicable thereunder.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $37.0 million, down $2.3 million from $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to lower compensation and benefit expenses as a result of headcount reductions in response to the continued decrease in drilling and completion activities, offset by $14.3 million in legal and professional fees incurred in connection with the out-of-court restructuring of our indebtedness in fiscal 2016.\nRental Revenue\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nIn addition, on the Effective Date, pursuant to the Plan, (i) all shares of the Company's pre-Effective Date common stock and all other previously issued and outstanding equity interests in the Company, and any rights of any holder in respect thereof, were canceled and discharged and (ii) all agreements, instruments, and other documents evidencing, relating to or connected with the Company's pre-Effective Date common stock and all other previously issued and outstanding equity interests of the Company, and any rights of any holder in respect thereof, were canceled and discharged and of no further force or effect.\nThe termination of the 2018 Notes and the 2021 Notes, and the indentures under which they were issued, resulted in the Company becoming exempt from the reporting requirements under Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X of the SEC with respect to the 2018 Notes and 2021 Notes. See Note 25 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further details.\n \u2022 Debtor-in-Possession Term Loan Credit Agreement, dated as of April 30, 2017, by and among the Company, the lenders party thereto, and Wilmington (the DIP Term Loan Agreement\u201d). \n \u2022 Entered into a Warrant Agreement with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company LLC, the Company's transfer agent; \nOperating Activities\n \u2022 Appointed three new members to the Company's Board of Directors to replace the directors of the Company who were deemed to have resigned on the Effective Date; \nEmergence from Chapter 11 Reorganization\n_________________________\n \u2022 Adopted a Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Third Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company; \n \u2022 Disposal Wells and Landfill: Liquid waste water from hydraulic fracturing operations, liquid waste water from well production, and solid drilling waste.  We utilize a broad array of assets to meet our customers' logistics and environmental management needs. Our logistics assets include trucks and trailers, temporary and permanent pipelines, temporary and permanent storage facilities, ancillary rental equipment, treatment facilities, and liquid and solid waste disposal sites. We continue to expand our suite of solutions to customers who demand safety, environmental compliance and accountability from their service providers.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIncome Taxes and Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets\nEnvironmental and Legal Contingencies\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $5.5 million, an increase of $4.5 million from December 31, 2016. The primary reason for the increase in cash and cash equivalents is due to the termination of our Predecessor Revolving Facility which required a daily cash sweep of our collection lockbox and certain depository accounts, the proceeds of which were required to be applied against the outstanding balance of the Predecessor asset-based lending facility. Our Successor revolving facility does not impose a similar restriction on our cash.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\n \u2022 Indenture governing the Company's 2018 Notes, dated April 10, 2012, among the Company, its subsidiaries, and The Bank of New York Mellon, N.A.

The increase is attributable to the gain on the sale of UGSI of $1.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. Additionally, we recorded a $3.3 million gain associated with the change in fair value of the derivative warrant liability. We issued warrants with derivative features in connection with our debt restructuring during the year ended December 31, 2016. These instruments are accounted for as derivative liabilities with any decrease or increase in the estimated fair value recorded in Other income, net.\u201d\nOur results are also driven by a number of other factors, including (i) availability of our equipment, which we have built through acquisitions and capital expenditures, (ii) transportation costs, which are affected by fuel costs, (iii) utilization rates for our equipment, which are also affected by the level of our customers' drilling and production activities and competition, and our ability to relocate our equipment to areas in which oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are growing, (iv) the availability of qualified drivers (or alternatively, subcontractors) in the areas in which we operate, particularly in the Bakken, Marcellus, and Utica shale basins, (v) labor costs, which we saw increase during 2017, (vi) developments in governmental regulations, (vii) seasonality and weather events (viii) pricing and (ix) our health, safety and environmental performance record.\nRevenue Recognition\nDirect operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $148.1 million, compared to $129.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 14.2%. The increase in direct operating expenses is attributable to higher revenues as\na result of increased activities in all divisions. Additionally, direct operating expenses during the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, included a loss on the sale of assets of $5.7 million and $3.5 million, respectively.\npost-closing working capital reconciliation related to the sale of TFI, partially offset by $3.8 million of purchases of property, plant and equipment.\nResults of Operations\n \u2022 Issued 7,900,000 shares of common stock of the reorganized Company to the holders of the Predecessor Company's 2021 Notes; \n \u2022 DIP Credit Agreement; and \nOther, net\nOn the Effective Date, the Company:\nCapital Expenditures\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n (2) Estimated interest on debt for all periods presented is calculated using interest rates available as of December 31, 2017 and includes fees for the unused portion of our Successor Revolving Facility. \n \u2022 Issued 3,695,580 shares of common stock of the reorganized Company to holders of Supporting Noteholder Term Loan Claims (as defined in the Plan) and to the Credit Agreement Lenders for the Exit Financing Commitment Fee (as defined in the Plan); \nThe following table details our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands).

For additional discussion of our accounting policies see Note 3 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a charge totaling approximately $7.1 million to restructure our business in certain shale basins and reduce costs, including an exit from the Mississippian shale area and the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale logistics business. Included in the $7.1 million of restructuring charges is approximately $5.9 million for the impairment of certain assets in the Mississippian shale area.\nThe Second Lien Term Loan Agreement also contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant, as well as other terms and conditions that are customary for term loans of this type. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants.\nUpon emergence, we elected to apply fresh start accounting effective July 31, 2017, to coincide with the timing of our normal accounting period close. Refer to Note 5 on Fresh Start Accounting\u201d in the Notes to the Financial Statements for additional information on the selection of this date. As a result of the application of fresh start accounting, as well as the effects of the implementation of the Plan, a new entity for financial reporting purposes was created, and as such, the condensed consolidated financial statements on or after August 1, 2017, are not comparable with the condensed consolidated financial statements prior to that date.\nOn the Effective Date, all of the following agreements, and all outstanding interests and obligations thereunder, were terminated:\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\n \u2022 Oil shale areas: includes our operations in the Bakken and Eagle Ford Shale areas. \n \u2022 Debtor-in-Possession Credit Agreement, dated as of April 30, 2017 and effective as of May 3, 2017, by and among the Company, the lenders party thereto, Wells Fargo, and other agents party thereto (the DIP Credit Agreement\u201d); and \nSecurity Agreements\nCash Flows and Liquidity\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we executed two amendments to our Predecessor asset-based lending facility and as a result wrote-off $0.7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the Predecessor asset-based lending facility. During the year ended December 31, 2015, as a result of two amendments to our Predecessor asset-based lending facility, we wrote-off a portion of the unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the Predecessor asset-based lending facility of approximately $2.1 million.\nThe majority of our revenues are from the transportation of fresh and saltwater by our trucks or through temporary or permanent water transport pipelines to customer sites for use in drilling and hydraulic fracturing activities and from customer sites to remove and dispose of flowback and produced water originating from oil and natural gas wells. Revenues are also generated through fees charged for disposal of oilfield wastes in our landfill, disposal of fluids in our disposal wells and from the rental of tanks and other equipment. Certain customers are under contract with us to utilize our saltwater pipeline. Transportation and disposal rates are generally based on a fixed fee per barrel of disposal water or, in certain circumstances transportation is based on an hourly rate. Revenue is recognized based on the number of barrels transported or disposed of at hourly rates for transportation services, depending on the customer contract. Rates for other services are based on negotiated rates with our customers and revenue is recognized when the services have been performed.\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $67.5 million, up $6.8 million from $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in our depreciable base as a result of fresh start accounting after emerging from chapter 11. The overall value of property, plant and equipment increased as a result of the valuations completed in coordination with fresh start accounting. Additionally, the assets were assigned shorter useful lives during the valuation process, thus increasing depreciation expense.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our primary sources of capital for 2017 have included cash generated by our operations, asset sales, restructuring transactions including borrowings from our Predecessor term loan, debtor in possession financing, Successor first lien term loan, Successor second lien term loan, and Successor revolving facility. At December 31, 2017, our total indebtedness was $39.0 million, and we had cash and cash equivalents of $5.5 million with $9.3 million of net availability under the Successor revolving facility and $5.7 million available as a delayed draw under the Successor second lien term loan.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $26.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net loss from continuing operations, after adjustments for non-cash items, used cash of $31.1 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $4.8 million primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable as a result of lower activity levels and billings in the current year, offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The non-cash items and other adjustments resulted in $60.8 million of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, $42.2 million in impairment of long-lived assets, $26.7 million in accrued interest added to debt principal, amortization of debt issuance costs of $6.2 million, a $3.5 million loss on the disposal of property, plant and equipment, stock-based compensation of $1.1 million, and the write-off of debt issuance costs of $0.7 million, partially offset by a $3.3 million gain resulting from the change in the fair value of the derivative warrant liability and a $1.7 million gain on the sale of UGSI.\npayable in cash, in arrears, on the first day of each month.

As of December 31, 2017, we had $39.0 million of indebtedness outstanding, consisting of $14.3 million under the Successor First Lien Term Loan, $21.0 million under the Successor Second Lien Term Loan, and $3.8 million of capital leases for vehicle financings.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 which consisted primarily of $10.7 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment, $5.0 million in proceeds from the sale of UGSI, and a $2.8 million decrease in restricted cash due primarily to the release of funds from escrow as a result of the completion of the\nWith regard to the valuation of deferred tax assets, we record valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount considered more likely than not to be realized. All available evidence is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is needed. See Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further information regarding the valuation of our deferred tax assets and the impact of new legislation.\nAccounts receivable are recognized and carried at the original invoice amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts. We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected uncollectability of trade receivables for both billed and unbilled receivables on our service and rental revenues. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of prospective and existing customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer's current credit worthiness, as determined by a review of their current credit information. In addition, we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified. Inherent in the assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts are certain judgments and estimates including, among others, the customer's willingness or ability to pay, our compliance with customer invoicing requirements, the effect of general economic conditions and the ongoing relationship with the customer. Additionally, if the financial condition of a specific customer or our general customer base were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFinancing Activities\ntax position that is challenged by a taxing authority could result in an adjustment to our income tax liabilities and related tax provision.\nWe measure and record tax contingency accruals in accordance with GAAP which prescribes a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a return.

The primary driver of the decreased demand in the basins we serve was a 57% decline in average operating oil rigs from those operating in the prior year.\nOn August 7, 2017, in connection with the Credit Agreement, the Company entered into (i) a First Lien Guaranty and Security Agreement by and among the Company, the other grantors party thereto, and the Credit Agreement Agent to grant a first lien security interest in all of such grantor's as collateral provided therein to secure the obligations under the Credit Agreement and (ii) a First Lien Trademark Security Agreement, by and among the Company, the other grantors party thereto, and the Credit Agreement Agent to grant a first lien security interest in certain trademark collateral as provided therein to secure obligations under the Credit Agreement.\nThe following table summarizes our total revenues, (loss) income from continuing operations before income taxes, and (loss) income from continuing operations for five months ended December 31, 2017, the seven months ended July 31, 2017, and the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): \nSee also Note 8 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further discussion.\n \u2022 Issued 118,137 warrants to purchase common stock of the reorganized Company, with an exercise price of $39.82 per share and an exercise term expiring seven years from the Effective Date; \nContractual Obligations\nWe record obligations to retire tangible, long-lived assets on our balance sheet as liabilities, which are recorded at a discount when we incur the liability. A certain amount of judgment is involved in estimating the future cash flows of such obligations, as well as the timing of these cash flows. If our assumptions and estimates on the amount or timing of the future cash flows change, it could potentially have a negative impact on our earnings.\n \u2022 2018 Notes Indenture; \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, management approved plans to sell certain assets located in both the Northeast and Southern divisions, which resulted in a long-lived asset impairment charge of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Additionally, long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. During the year ended December 31, 2016, there were indicators that the assets in the Bakken, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Marcellus/Utica basins were not recoverable and as a result we recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $37.4 million.\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash from continuing operations for the five months ended December 31, 2017, seven months ended July 31, 2017, and the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): \nLoss from discontinued operations in the years ended December 31, 2016 represents the final closing adjustments of TFI, our industrial solutions business, which was sold in April of 2015. Such loss, which is presented net of income taxes, was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. See Note 23 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional information.\nOther income, net was $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is primarily attributable to the gain on the sale of Underground Solutions Inc. (or UGSI\u201d) of $1.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 (see Note 21 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded gains of $4.3 million and $3.3 million, respectively, associated with the change in fair value of the derivative warrant liability. We issued warrants with derivative features upon our emergence from chapter 11 during the year ended December 31, 2017, and in connection with our debt restructuring during the year ended December 31, 2016. These instruments are accounted for as derivative liabilities with any decrease or increase in the estimated fair value recorded in Other income, net.\u201d See Note 12 and Note 13 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the warrants.\nWe have established liabilities for environmental and legal contingencies. We record a loss contingency for these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining the liability, we consider a number of factors including, but not limited to, the jurisdiction of the claim, related claims, insurance coverage when insurance covers the type of claim and our historic outcomes in similar matters, if applicable. A significant amount of judgment and the use of estimates are required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters. The determination of liabilities for these contingencies is reviewed periodically to ensure that we have accrued the proper level of expense. The liability balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues, including the effect of any applicable insurance coverage for these matters. While we believe that the amount accrued is adequate, future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations.\nThe following table sets forth for each of the periods indicated our statements of operations data (dollars in thousands):\nThe income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $0.8 million (a (0.5%) effective rate) compared to a benefit of $0.1 million (a near zero effective rate) in the prior year. The effective tax rate in 2016 is primarily the result of federal alternative minimum tax and the change in valuation allowance attributable to long-lived assets. See Note 17 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional information on income taxes.\nFuture realization of the tax benefit of an existing deductible temporary difference or carryforward ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the tax law. We have had significant pretax losses in recent years. Accordingly, we do not have income in carryback years. These cumulative losses also present significant negative evidence about the likelihood of income in carryforward periods.\nAdditionally, long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. During the year ended December 31, 2016, there were indicators that the assets in the Bakken, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Marcellus/Utica basins were not recoverable and as a result we recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $37.4 million.\nInvesting Activities\nRental Revenue\nAs of December 31, 2017, we did not have any material off-balance-sheet arrangements other than operating leases, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.\nInterest expense, net during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $25.0 million compared to $54.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is primarily due to the reduction in our outstanding debt balance during 2017 as a result of the consummation of the Plan. As of December 31, 2017, our outstanding debt balance was $39.0 million, while as of December 31, 2016, outstanding debt was $487.6 million. The significant decrease in debt has dramatically lowered our annual interest expense. See Note 11 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further details.\nReorganization Items, net\nFirst Lien Credit Agreements\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOn the Effective Date, pursuant to the Plan, the Company entered into a $45.0 million First Lien Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) by and among the lenders party thereto (the Credit Agreement Lenders\u201d), ACF FinCo I, LP, as administrative agent (the Credit Agreement Agent\u201d), and the Company. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Credit Agreement Lenders agreed to extend to the Company a $30.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Successor Revolving Facility\u201d) and a $15.0 million senior secured term loan facility (the Successor First Lien Term Loan\u201d) (i) to repay obligations outstanding under the Predecessor Revolving Facility and debtor in possession asset based lending facility, (ii) to make certain payments as provided in the Plan, (iii) to pay costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Plan, and (iv) for working capital, transaction expenses, and other general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement also contains an accordion feature that provides for an increase in availability of up to an additional $20.0 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions contained in the Credit Agreement.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $93.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and was primarily a result of using the proceeds received from the sale of TFI to make $81.6 million in payments on our Predecessor asset-based lending facility. Additionally, we used cash of $11.2 million for payments under capital leases, notes payable and other financing activities, and $0.2 million for payments of debt issuance costs.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $49.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The net loss from continuing operations, after adjustments for non-cash items, used cash of $6.3 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided cash of $56.1 million primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable due to a focused effort on collections and lower activity levels. The non-cash items and other adjustments included $104.7 million in impairment of goodwill, $70.5 million of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, $5.9 million in impairment of long-lived assets, amortization of debt issuance costs of $4.8 million, and the write-off of debt issuance costs of $2.1 million.\n\nAs a result of the cancellation of the Company's pre-Effective Date common stock on the Effective Date, the Company's pre-Effective Date common stock ceased trading on the OTC Pink under the symbol NESCQ.\u201d On October 12, 2017, the Company's post-Effective Date common stock was listed and began trading on the NYSE American under the symbol NES.\u201d See Risks Related to our Common Stock\u201d on page 22 of this Annual Report.\nIncome Taxes\nCompany Overview\n \u2022 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended through the Fourteenth Amendment thereto, dated as of February 3, 2014, by and among Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( Wells Fargo\u201d), the lenders named therein, and the Company (the Predecessor Revolving Facility\u201d); \n \u2022 Entered into the Second Lien Term Loan Credit Agreement, pursuant to which the Second Lien Term Loan Lenders extended the Company the Successor Second Lien Term Loan; \nNet cash used in operating activities was $25.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net income from continuing operations, after adjustments for non-cash items, used cash of $15.6 million as compared to $31.1 million in 2016, as described below. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used $9.8 million primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable as a result of higher activity levels and billings in the current year, offset by lower accrued liabilities. The non-cash items and other adjustments included the non-cash reorganization items of $218.6 million arising primarily from the gain on debt discharge due to the consummation of the Plan, a $4.3 million gain resulting from the change in the fair value of the derivative warrant liability, a $0.6 million change in deferred income taxes and a $0.1 million gain on the sale of UGSI, all offset by $67.5 million of depreciation expense and amortization of intangible assets, $11.9 million in accrued interest added to debt principal, $4.9 million in impairment of long-lived assets, a $5.4 million loss on the disposal of property, plant and equipment, amortization of debt issuance costs of $2.1 million, stock-based compensation of $1.1 million, and bad debt expense of $0.9 million.\nWe recorded total impairment charges of $4.9 million for long-lived assets classified as held for sale during the year ended December 31, 2017, which was included in Impairment of long-lived assets\u201d in the consolidated statement of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded total impairment charges for long-lived assets of $42.2 million. These charges were due to the carrying value of assets for certain basins not being recoverable, as well as for assets that were classified as held for sale during 2016. We recorded long-lived asset impairment charges associated with our restructuring of $5.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, which was included in Other, net\u201d in the consolidated statement of operations (See Note 9). We could recognize future impairments to the extent adverse events or changes in circumstances result in conditions in which long-lived assets are not recoverable. See Note 8 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our impairment charges.\n \u2022 Logistics and Wellsite Services: Delivery of freshwater to wellsites, freshwater procurement and transfer services, staging and storage of equipment and materials, rental of wellsite equipment, and construction services including wellpads. \nOur service offering focuses on providing comprehensive environmental and logistics management solutions within three primary groups:\n \u2022 Predecessor Term Loan; \nOn August 7, 2017, in connection with the Credit Agreement and the Second Lien Term Loan Agreement, the Company acknowledged the terms and conditions under a Subordination and Intercreditor Agreement (the Intercreditor Agreement\u201d), dated as of August 7, 2017, by and among the Credit Agreement Agent and the Second Lien Term Loan Agent to set forth the terms and conditions of the relationship between the lenders and the secured parties under the Credit Agreement and Second Lien Term Loan Agreement. On August 7, 2017, the Company entered into an Intercompany Subordination Agreement (the Intercompany Agreement\u201d), dated as of August 7, 2017, by and among the Company and the other obligors named therein to agree to subordinate its indebtedness to the Credit Agreement Lenders and the Second Lien Term Loan Lenders.\n (1) Principal payments are reflected when contractually required. \nThe Credit Agreement also contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant, as well as other terms and conditions that are customary for revolving credit facilities and term loans of this type. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants.\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $60.8 million, down $9.7 million from $70.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to a lower depreciable asset base as we have reduced capital spending and sold underutilized or non-core assets as a result of lower oil prices and decreased activities by our customers.\nLoss from Discontinued Operations\nLoss from discontinued operations in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 represents the financial results and final closing adjustments of TFI, our industrial solutions business, which was sold in April of 2015. Such loss, which is presented net of income taxes, was $1.2 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Note 23 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional information.\n \u2022 Predecessor Revolving Facility; \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, management approved plans to sell certain assets located in both the Northeast and Southern divisions, including trucks, tanks, and a parcel of land. These assets qualified to be classified as assets held for sale and as a result the assets were recorded at the lower of net book value or fair value less costs to sell. This resulted in a long-lived asset impairment charge of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates.\n \u2022 Entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with certain holders of the reorganized Company's common stock party thereto; \nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nIn order to address our liquidity issues due to the prolonged depression in oil and natural gas prices, on May 1, 2017, the Company and certain of its material subsidiaries (collectively with the Company, the Nuverra Parties\u201d) filed voluntary petitions under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code\u201d) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the Bankruptcy Court\u201d) to pursue prepackaged plans of reorganization (together, and as amended, the Plan\u201d). On July 25, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the Confirmation Order\u201d) confirming the Plan. The Plan became effective on August 7, 2017 (the Effective Date\u201d), when all remaining conditions to the effectiveness of the Plan were satisfied or waived. Although the Nuverra Parties emerged from bankruptcy on the Effective Date, the bankruptcy cases will remain pending until closed by the Bankruptcy Court.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $68.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and consisted primarily of $78.9 million of proceeds from the sale of TFI, $12.7 million in proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment, offset by $19.2 million of purchases of property, plant and equipment.\nExpenses, gains and losses directly associated with the chapter 11 proceedings are reported as Reorganization items, net\u201d in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017, which includes the net gain on debt discharge, professional and insurance fees, debtor in possession credit agreement financing costs, retention bonus payments, and other chapter 11 related items. See Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further details.\n \u2022 DIP Term Loan Agreement. \nIn connection with the our emergence from the chapter 11 cases, all of the following agreements, and all outstanding interests and obligations thereunder, were terminated on the Effective Date:\nOn August 7, 2017, in connection with the Second Lien Term Loan Agreement, the Company entered into (i) a Second Lien Guaranty and Security Agreement by and among the Company, the other grantors party thereto, and the Second Lien Term Loan Agent to grant a second lien security interest in all of such grantor's collateral as provided therein to secure the obligations under the Second Lien Term Loan Agreement and (ii) a Second Lien Trademark Security Agreement, by and among the Company, the other grantors party thereto, and the Second Lien Term Loan Agent to grant a second lien security interest in certain trademark collateral as provided therein to secure obligations under the Second Lien Term Loan Agreement.\nWe operate in shale basins where customer exploration and production ( E&P\u201d) activities are predominantly focused on shale oil and natural gas as follows:\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nService Revenue\nAs a matter of law, we are subject to examination by federal and state taxing authorities. We have estimated and provided for income taxes in accordance with settlements reached with the Internal Revenue Service in prior audits. Although we believe that the amounts reflected in our tax returns substantially comply with the applicable federal and state tax regulations, both the IRS and the various state taxing authorities can take positions contrary to our position based on their interpretation of the law. A\n \u2022 Assumed Mark D. Johnsrud's, the Company's former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Second Amended and Restated Employment Agreement, dated April 28, 2017 and entered into an Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with Joseph M. Crabb, the Company's Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer. \nDue to oil prices beginning to recover in 2017 from historic lows, drilling and completion activities increased in all of our active basins. We would expect continued stability in oil prices or further price growth to lead to increased drilling and completion activities by our customer base during 2018 when compared to 2017. Increased drilling and completion activities would likely lead to a higher demand for our services in 2018; however, there is no guarantee that oil prices will remain stable or increase, drilling and completion activities in basins will continue to increase, or we will see an increase in a demand for our services in 2018.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe recognize revenues in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 605 (ASC 605 Revenue Recognition\u201d) and Staff Accounting Bulletin No 104, and accordingly all of the following criteria must be met for revenues to be recognized: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price to the buyer is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we executed two amendments to our Predecessor asset-based lending facility and as a result wrote-off $0.7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the Predecessor asset-based lending facility.\nDirect operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $129.6 million, compared to $279.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of 53.7%. The decrease in direct operating expenses is attributable to lower revenues as a result of decreased activities, as well as our continued focus on our cost-management initiatives. Additionally, direct operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016 included a loss on the sale of assets of $3.5 million, while the year ended December 31, 2015 included a gain on the sale of assets of $0.3 million.\n \u2022 Paid in full in cash all administrative expense claims, priority tax claims, priority claims, and debtor in possession revolving credit facility claims; \n \u2022 Issued 100,000 shares of common stock of the reorganized Company to the Affected Classes (as defined in the Plan); \nIncome Taxes\nImpairment of Goodwill\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\n \u2022 Term Loan Credit Agreement, as amended through the Ninth Amendment thereto, dated as of April 15, 2016, by and among Wilmington, the lenders named therein, and the Company (the Predecessor Term Loan\u201d); \nIntercreditor Agreement and Intercompany Subordination Agreement\nFuture reversals of existing taxable temporary differences are another source of taxable income that is used in this analysis. As a result, deferred tax liabilities in excess of deferred tax assets generally will provide support for recognition of deferred tax assets. However, most of our deferred tax assets are associated with net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards, which statutorily expire after a specified number of years; therefore, we compare the estimated timing of these taxable timing difference reversals with the scheduled expiration of our NOL carryforwards, considering any limitations on use of NOL carryforwards, and record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that would expire unused.\nDepreciation and Amortization\n\n (b) Represents revenues that are derived from predominantly natural gas-rich areas consisting of the Marcellus, Utica, and Haynesville shale basins. Note that the Utica shale basin was previously included in the oil shale basins until the three months ended September 30, 2015 when it was reclassified as a natural gas shale basin. \nDirect Operating Expenses\nCash required for capital expenditures (related to continuing operations) for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $5.4 million compared to $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to expenditures to extend the useful life and productivity on our fleet of trucks, tanks, equipment and disposal wells. Although we did not enter into any new capital leases during the year ended December 31, 2017, historically, a portion of our transportation-related capital requirements were financed through capital leases, which are excluded from the capital expenditures figures cited in the preceding sentences. We continue to focus on improving the utilization of our existing assets and optimizing the allocation of resources in the various shale basins in which we operate. Our capital expenditures program is subject to market conditions, including customer activity levels, commodity prices, industry capacity and specific customer needs. Our planned capital expenditures for 2018 are expected to be financed through cash flow from operations, borrowings under our Successor credit facility and term loan facilities, capital leases, or a combination of the foregoing.\nNo charges were recorded for the impairment of long-lived assets line for the year ended December 31, 2015. See also Note 8 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further discussion.\nOther Income, net\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $33.2 million, down $3.8 million from $37.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to lower legal and professional fees as the costs relating to the chapter 11 filing are included in Reorganization items, net\u201d on the consolidated statement of operations, while the costs incurred with the restructuring of our indebtedness in 2016 were included in general and administrative expenses. Offsetting the lower legal and professional fees were increased payroll costs.\nOn May 1, 2017, the Nuverra Parties filed voluntary petitions under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court to pursue the Plan. On July 25, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Confirmation Order confirming the Plan. On July 26, 2017, David Hargreaves, an individual holder of our Predecessor 2018 Notes, appealed the Confirmation Order to the District Court for the District of Delaware (the District Court\u201d) and filed a motion for a stay pending appeal from the District Court. On August 3, 2017, the District Court entered an order denying the motion for a stay pending appeal. Notwithstanding the denial of the motion for stay pending appeal, Hargreaves' appeal remains pending in the District Court.\n \u2022 Paid all undisputed, non-contingent customer, vendor, or other obligations not specifically compromised under the Plan; and \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, management approved plans to sell certain assets located in both the Rocky Mountain and Southern divisions, including trucks and tanks. These assets qualified to be classified as assets held for sale and as a result the assets were recorded at the lower of net book value or fair value less costs to sell. This resulted in a long-lived asset impairment charge of $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nWe recorded goodwill impairment charges of $104.7 million related to our Rocky Mountain division during the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of our annual impairment test, thereby eliminating all remaining goodwill on the consolidated balance sheet.\nDirect Operating Expenses\nThe Nuverra Parties emerged from the bankruptcy proceedings on the Effective Date. Although the Nuverra Parties emerged from bankruptcy on the Effective Date, the bankruptcy cases will remain pending until closed by the Bankruptcy Court.\nThe income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $0.7 million (a (0.6%) effective rate) compared to expense of $0.8 million (a (0.5%) effective rate) in the prior year. The effective tax rate in 2017 is primarily the result of federal alternative minimum tax and the change in valuation allowance attributable to long-lived assets. See Note 17 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional information on income taxes.\nNuverra is a leading provider of comprehensive, full-cycle environmental solutions to customers focused on the development and ongoing production of oil and natural gas from shale formations in the United States. We provide one-stop, total environmental solutions and wellsite logistics management, including delivery, collection, treatment and disposal of solid and liquid materials that are used in and generated by the drilling, completion, and ongoing production of shale oil and natural gas.\nOther Income, net\nThe Successor Second Lien Term Loan matures on February 7, 2021, at which time the Company must repay all outstanding obligations under the Successor Second Lien Term Loan. The principal amount of the Successor Second Lien Term Loan shall be repaid in installments of $263.2 thousand beginning on October 1, 2017, and the first day of each fiscal quarter thereafter prior to maturity, with such amount to be proportionally increased as the result of the incurrence of a Delayed Draw Term Loan. Interest on the Successor Second Lien Term Loan accrues at an annual rate equal to 11.0%, with 5.5% payable in cash and 5.5% payable in kind prior to February 7, 2018 (or such later date as the Company may select in accordance with the terms of the Second Lien Term Loan Agreement) and, on or after February 7, 2018 (or such later date), at an annual rate equal to 11.0%,\nService revenue consists of fees charged to customers for the sale and transportation of fresh water and saltwater by our fleet of logistics assets and/or through water midstream assets owned by us to customer sites for use in drilling and completion activities and from customer sites to remove and dispose of flowback and produced water originating from oil and natural gas wells. Service revenue also includes fees for solids management services. Service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $159.0 million, up $19.1 million, or 13.6%, from $139.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Increases in drilling and completion activities in all divisions during 2017 led to higher service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The primary driver of the increase in demand in the basins we operate was a 73% increase in average operating drilling rigs from those operating in the prior year.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $26.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and was primarily due to $79.2 million of net repayments on the Predecessor asset-based lending facility, offset by $55.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of the Predecessor term loan.\n (4) Represents the $0.5 million due related to the acquisition of Ideal Oilfield Disposal LLC, which is payable when the Ideal settlement counterparties deliver the required permits and certificates necessary for the issuance of the second special waste disposal permit. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the settlement. \nService revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $139.9 million, down $187.8 million, or 57.3%, from $327.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Continued lower drilling and completion activities in all divisions during 2016, as well as pricing pressures, led to lower service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended\nInterest expense, net during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $54.5 million compared to $49.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily due to the restructuring of our indebtedness during the year ended December 31, 2016. As part of the debt restructuring, a portion of our 2018 Notes were exchanged for new 2021 Notes whereby the interest due on October 15, 2016 was payable in kind at an annual rate of 12.5%. Additionally, we entered into a new term loan with interest payable in kind at 13% compounded monthly.\nService Revenue\nResults of Operations\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nWe are subject to federal income taxes and state income taxes in those jurisdictions in which we operate. We exercise judgment with regard to income taxes in interpreting whether expenses are deductible in accordance with federal income tax and state income tax codes, estimating annual effective federal and state income tax rates and assessing whether deferred tax assets are, more likely than not, expected to be realized. The accuracy of these judgments impacts the amount of income tax expense we recognize each period.\nWe review long-lived assets including intangible assets with finite useful lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a long-lived asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. If an impairment indicator is present, we evaluate recoverability by comparing the estimated future cash flows of the asset group, on an undiscounted basis, to their carrying values. The asset group represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is present. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, the impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the long-lived asset (or asset group). Our determination that an event or change in circumstance has occurred potentially indicating the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable generally includes but is not limited to one or more of the following: (1) a deterioration in an asset's financial performance compared to historical results, (2) a shortfall in an asset's financial performance compared to forecasted results, (3) changes affecting the utility and estimated future demands for the asset, (4) a significant decrease in the market price of an asset, (5) a current expectation that a long-lived asset will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life, (6) a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset (asset group) is being used or in its physical condition, and (7) declining operations and severe changes in projected cash flows.\nOn the Effective Date, pursuant to the Plan, the Company also entered into a Second Lien Term Loan Credit Agreement (the Second Lien Term Loan Agreement\u201d) by and among the lenders party thereto (the Second Lien Term Loan Lenders\u201d), Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB ( Wilmington\u201d), as administrative agent (the Second Lien Term Loan Agent\u201d), and the Company. Pursuant to the Second Lien Term Loan Agreement, the Second Lien Term Loan Lenders agreed to extend to the Company a $26.8 million second lien term loan facility (the Successor Second Lien Term Loan\u201d), of which $21.1 million was advanced on the Effective Date and up to an additional $5.7 million ( Delayed Draw Term Loan\u201d) is available at the request of the Company after the closing date subject to the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions specified in the Second Lien Term Loan Agreement. The Second Lien Term Loan Lenders extended the Successor Second Lien Term Loan, among other things, (i) to repay obligations outstanding under the Predecessor Revolving Facility and debtor in possession asset based revolving facility, (ii) to make certain payments as provided in the Plan, (iii) to pay costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Plan, and (iv) for working capital, transaction expenses and other general corporate purposes.\nOur results are driven by demand for our services, which are in turn affected by E&P spending trends in the shale basins in which we operate, in particular the level of drilling and completion activities (which impacts the amount of environmental waste products being managed) and active wells (which impacts the amount of produced water being managed). In general, drilling and completion activities in the oil and natural gas industry is affected by the market prices (or anticipated prices) for those commodities.\n \u2022 Water Midstream: Collection and transportation of produced water from wellsites to disposal network via trucking or a fixed pipeline system, supplying freshwater for drilling and completion via pipeline system, gathering systems for collection and transportation of flowback and produced water to disposal wells. \n (3) Represents operating leases primarily for facilities, vehicles and rental equipment. \nRental revenue consists of fees charged to customers for use of equipment owned by us over the term of the rental period, as well as other fees charged to customers for items such as delivery and pickup. Rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $17.1 million, up $4.8 million, or 39.2%, from $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was the result of higher utilization of our rental fleet in all divisions in conjunction with the increase in drilling and completion activities in 2017 due to higher oil prices.\nThe Successor Revolving Facility and the Successor First Lien Term Loan mature on August 7, 2020, at which time the Company must repay the outstanding principal amount of the Successor Revolving Facility and the Successor First Lien Term Loan, together with interest accrued and unpaid thereon. The Successor Revolving Facility may be repaid and, subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, reborrowed at any time during the term of the Credit Agreement. The principal amount of the Successor First Lien Term Loan shall be repaid in installments of $178.6 thousand beginning on September 1, 2017 and the first day of each calendar month thereafter prior to maturity. Interest on the Successor Revolving Facility accrues at an annual rate equal to the LIBOR Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus 5.25%, and interest on the Successor First Lien Term Loan accrues at an annual rate equal to the LIBOR Rate plus 7.25%; however, if there is an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement), the Credit Agreement Agent, in its sole discretion, may increase the applicable interest rate at a per annum rate equal to three percentage points above the annual rate otherwise applicable thereunder.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $37.0 million, down $2.3 million from $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to lower compensation and benefit expenses as a result of headcount reductions in response to the continued decrease in drilling and completion activities, offset by $14.3 million in legal and professional fees incurred in connection with the out-of-court restructuring of our indebtedness in fiscal 2016.\nRental Revenue\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nIn addition, on the Effective Date, pursuant to the Plan, (i) all shares of the Company's pre-Effective Date common stock and all other previously issued and outstanding equity interests in the Company, and any rights of any holder in respect thereof, were canceled and discharged and (ii) all agreements, instruments, and other documents evidencing, relating to or connected with the Company's pre-Effective Date common stock and all other previously issued and outstanding equity interests of the Company, and any rights of any holder in respect thereof, were canceled and discharged and of no further force or effect.\nThe termination of the 2018 Notes and the 2021 Notes, and the indentures under which they were issued, resulted in the Company becoming exempt from the reporting requirements under Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X of the SEC with respect to the 2018 Notes and 2021 Notes. See Note 25 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further details.\n \u2022 Debtor-in-Possession Term Loan Credit Agreement, dated as of April 30, 2017, by and among the Company, the lenders party thereto, and Wilmington (the DIP Term Loan Agreement\u201d). \n \u2022 Entered into a Warrant Agreement with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company LLC, the Company's transfer agent; \nOperating Activities\n \u2022 Appointed three new members to the Company's Board of Directors to replace the directors of the Company who were deemed to have resigned on the Effective Date; \nEmergence from Chapter 11 Reorganization\n_________________________\n \u2022 Adopted a Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Third Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company; \n \u2022 Disposal Wells and Landfill: Liquid waste water from hydraulic fracturing operations, liquid waste water from well production, and solid drilling waste.  We utilize a broad array of assets to meet our customers' logistics and environmental management needs. Our logistics assets include trucks and trailers, temporary and permanent pipelines, temporary and permanent storage facilities, ancillary rental equipment, treatment facilities, and liquid and solid waste disposal sites. We continue to expand our suite of solutions to customers who demand safety, environmental compliance and accountability from their service providers.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIncome Taxes and Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets\nEnvironmental and Legal Contingencies\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $5.5 million, an increase of $4.5 million from December 31, 2016. The primary reason for the increase in cash and cash equivalents is due to the termination of our Predecessor Revolving Facility which required a daily cash sweep of our collection lockbox and certain depository accounts, the proceeds of which were required to be applied against the outstanding balance of the Predecessor asset-based lending facility. Our Successor revolving facility does not impose a similar restriction on our cash.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\n \u2022 Indenture governing the Company's 2018 Notes, dated April 10, 2012, among the Company, its subsidiaries, and The Bank of New York Mellon, N.A. (the 2018 Notes Indenture\u201d); \n (a) Represents revenues that are derived from predominantly oil-rich areas consisting of the Bakken, Eagle Ford, Mississippian and Tuscaloosa Marine Shale areas (prior to our substantial exit from the Mississippian and Tuscaloosa Marine shale basins during the three months ended March 31, 2015). Note that the Utica shale basin was previously included in the oil shale basins until the three months ended September 30, 2015 when it was reclassified as a natural gas shale basin. \nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n \u2022 Natural gas shale areas: includes our operations in the Marcellus, Utica, and Haynesville Shale areas.  We support our customers' demand for diverse, comprehensive and regulatory compliant environmental solutions required for the safe and efficient drilling, completion and production of oil and natural gas from shale formations.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, and the Notes and Schedules related thereto, which are included in this Annual Report.\n \u2022 Indenture governing the Company's 2021 Notes, dated April 15, 2016, among the Company, Wilmington, and the guarantors party thereto (the 2021 Notes Indenture\u201d); \nOther income, net was $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is attributable to the gain on the sale of UGSI of $1.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. Additionally, we recorded a $3.3 million gain associated with the change in fair value of the derivative warrant liability. We issued warrants with derivative features in connection with our debt restructuring during the year ended December 31, 2016. These instruments are accounted for as derivative liabilities with any decrease or increase in the estimated fair value recorded in Other income, net.\u201d\nOur results are also driven by a number of other factors, including (i) availability of our equipment, which we have built through acquisitions and capital expenditures, (ii) transportation costs, which are affected by fuel costs, (iii) utilization rates for our equipment, which are also affected by the level of our customers' drilling and production activities and competition, and our ability to relocate our equipment to areas in which oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are growing, (iv) the availability of qualified drivers (or alternatively, subcontractors) in the areas in which we operate, particularly in the Bakken, Marcellus, and Utica shale basins, (v) labor costs, which we saw increase during 2017, (vi) developments in governmental regulations, (vii) seasonality and weather events (viii) pricing and (ix) our health, safety and environmental performance record.\nRevenue Recognition\nDirect operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $148.1 million, compared to $129.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 14.2%. The increase in direct operating expenses is attributable to higher revenues as\na result of increased activities in all divisions. Additionally, direct operating expenses during the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, included a loss on the sale of assets of $5.7 million and $3.5 million, respectively.\npost-closing working capital reconciliation related to the sale of TFI, partially offset by $3.8 million of purchases of property, plant and equipment.\nResults of Operations\n \u2022 Issued 7,900,000 shares of common stock of the reorganized Company to the holders of the Predecessor Company's 2021 Notes; \n \u2022 DIP Credit Agreement; and \nOther, net\nOn the Effective Date, the Company:\nCapital Expenditures\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n (2) Estimated interest on debt for all periods presented is calculated using interest rates available as of December 31, 2017 and includes fees for the unused portion of our Successor Revolving Facility. \n \u2022 Issued 3,695,580 shares of common stock of the reorganized Company to holders of Supporting Noteholder Term Loan Claims (as defined in the Plan) and to the Credit Agreement Lenders for the Exit Financing Commitment Fee (as defined in the Plan); \nThe following table details our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands). See Note 18 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \nRental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $12.3 million, down $16.8 million, or 57.7%, from $29.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was the result of lower utilization of our rental fleet in all divisions in conjunction with the continued reduction in drilling and completion activities in 2016 due to depressed oil
