MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. The MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nImpacts of the Recent Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)\nThis disclosure discusses the actions the Company has taken in response to the COVID-19 crisis and the impacts that it has had on our business, as well as related known or expected trends.\nCOVID-19 was identified in China in late 2019 and has since spread throughout the world, including throughout the United States (U.S.). COVID-19 has resulted in authorities implementing numerous preventative measures to contain or mitigate the outbreak of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limitations on business activity, quarantines, and shelter-in-place orders.\nThese restrictions and our responses to them are impacting our customers and their use of our products and services. In addition, governments have imposed a wide variety of consumer protection measures that limit how certain businesses, including TMT companies, can operate their businesses and interact with their customers. The crisis and governmental responses to the crisis have also resulted in a slowdown of global economic activity, which has impacted our customers. As a result, prior trends in our business may not be applicable to our operations during the pendency of the crisis.\nThe impact of COVID-19 will depend significantly on the duration and potential cyclicality of the health crisis and the related public policy actions, additional initiatives we undertake in response to employee, market or regulatory needs or demands, the length and severity of the global economic slowdown, and whether and how our customers change their behaviors over the longer term. As a result, the demand for our products and services, as well as our overall results of operations, may be materially and adversely impacted by the pandemic for the duration of 2021 or longer, and we are unable to predict the duration or degree of such impact with any certainty.\nIn response to COVID-19, we have been executing our business continuity plans and evolving our operations to protect the safety of our employees while continuing to provide critical products and services to our customers. Some of the initiatives the Company has undertaken include:\n\u2022Working with our customers to continue to provide our products and services through the pandemic\n\u2022Enhancing our safety protocols including moving the majority of our employees to remote work arrangements\n\u2022Adjusting business operations to address circumstances created by COVID-19\n\u2022Maintaining effective governance and internal controls in a remote work environment\nAs the crisis continues, we may revise our approach to these initiatives or take additional actions to meet the needs of our employees, customers and the Company and to continue to provide our products and services.\nRevenues\nWe generate most of our revenues on a per transaction or subscription basis, which is derived from contracts that extend up to 60 months from execution.\nThe future success of our business depends on the continued growth of Business-to-Business and Business-to-Business-to-Consumer driving customer transactions, and continued expansion of our platforms into the TMT Market globally through Cloud, Messaging and Digital markets. As such, the volume of transactions and our ability to expand our footprint in TMT and globally may result in revenue fluctuations on a quarterly basis.\nMost of our revenues are recorded in U.S. dollars but as we continue to expand our footprint with international carriers, we will become subject to currency translation that could affect our future net sales as reported in U.S. dollars.\nThe Company's top five customers accounted for 68.0%, 69.2% and 69.0% of net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Contracts with these customers typically run for three to five years. Of these customers,\nVerizon accounted for more than 10% of the Company's revenues in 2020, 2019, and 2018. The loss of Verizon as a customer would have a material negative impact on our company. However, we believe that the costs incurred and subscriber disruption by Verizon to replace Synchronoss' solutions would be substantial.\nCurrent Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop, we are actively monitoring the global situation. The extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our customers and our sales cycles, impact on our business operations, impact on our customer, employee or industry events, and effect on our vendors, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact our business, financial condition or results of operations is uncertain, but may include, without limitation, impacts to our paying user growth as well as disruptions to our business operations as a result of travel restrictions, shutdown of workplaces and potential impacts to our vendors. Additionally, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to U.S. dollars, our reporting currency, as well as changes in interest rates. Volatile market conditions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic have and may continue to negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows, due to a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which may cause our revenues to decline relative to our costs.\nBusiness from our Synchronoss Personal Cloud\u2122 solution has been driven by the growth in mobile devices globally that are becoming content rich. As these devices replace other traditional devices like PCs, the ability to securely back up content from mobile devices, sync it with other devices and share it with family, friends and business associates have become essential needs and subscriber expectations. Such devices include smartphones, connected cars, personal health and wellness devices and connected home devices. The need for the contents of these devices to be stored in a common cloud are also expected to be drivers of our business in the longer term.\nBusiness from our traditional Synchronoss Messaging business (Email) has been driven by a resurgence in the need for white label secure messaging platforms that favor the Mobile Network Operator's ( MNO\u201d) business objectives and are not beholden to the objectives of a sponsoring over-the-top ( OTT\u201d) platform. We believe that messaging drives higher subscriber engagement than any other application in the market today and holds the potential to stimulate new revenue from traditional services and third-party brands. OTT global success has driven MNOs to look at opportunities to preempt and compete with the OTTs which has potential opportunity for Synchronoss' future growth to be driven by the need of TMT companies including (and especially) MNOs to embrace Messaging as a Platform ( MaaP\u201d). MaaP will allow TMT and MNO's to converse with subscribers in an efficient, automated way by streamlining the costs and increasing the effectiveness of self-care, as well as yielding cross-sell upselling of service plans, devices, bundles, etc. The Synchronoss Advanced Messaging Platform provides state of the art RCS-driven features including the ability to support advanced Peer to Peer communications and introduce new revenue streams driven by commerce and advertising via Application-to-Person capabilities.\nCompanies in the TMT market all face the dilemma of attempting to pivot their businesses to digital execution in order to create experiences that meet the expectations of their subscribers, generate new revenues and streamline costs creating healthier margins at a faster time to market than they have ever operated before. Their challenges feature the lack of skill sets to conceptualize and run day to day digital operations and the lack of resources to integrate their legacy back end systems to enact digital experiences that achieve their business objectives. The growth of Synchronoss Digital Platforms will be driven by the ability to provide TMT companies' desire to obtain digital transformation solutions as quickly as possible while educating them on the ability to operate a digital business efficiently. Our Platform as a Service ( PaaS\u201d) model provides a desirable alternative to heavy capital expenditure spending options often tried internally. The ability for our platforms to create low/no code, new customer digital journeys, virtually on the fly, gives TMT Companies the ability to operate new experiences and businesses without heavily investing in development resources.\nTo support our growth, which we expect to be driven by these favorable industry trends mentioned above, we will leverage modular components from our existing software platforms to build new products. We believe that these opportunities will continue to provide future benefits and position us for future revenue growth. We are also making investments in research and development of new products designed to enable us to grow rapidly in the mobile wireless market. Our purchase of capital assets and equipment may also increase based on aggressive deployment, subscriber growth and promotional offers for free or bundled storage by our major Tier 1 carrier customers.\nWe continue to expand our platforms into the converging TMT, MNO, and Digital spaces to enable connected devices to do more things across multiple networks, brands and communities. Our initiatives with AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, British Telecom, Softbank and other CSPs continue to grow both with regard to our current business as well as our new product\nofferings. We are also exploring additional opportunities through merger and acquisition activities to support our customer, product and geographic diversification strategies.\nDiscussion of the Consolidated Statements of Operations\nThe following table presents an overview of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands).\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 vs 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>291,670 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>308,749 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>325,839 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(17,079) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(17,090) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues* </td> <td>121,817 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>150,407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>158,802 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(28,590) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,395) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development </td> <td>77,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,568 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79,172 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,475 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,604) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative </td> <td>89,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>112,771 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>122,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23,479) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,341) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges </td> <td>7,955 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>755 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11,620) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>43,685 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77,036 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>117,654 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33,351) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(40,618) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total costs and expenses </td> <td>339,792 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>416,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>490,115 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(76,745) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(73,578) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from continuing operations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(48,122) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(107,788) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(164,276) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59,666 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56,488 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________________________\n* Cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization which are shown separately.\nNet revenues decreased $17.1 million to $291.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. The overall change is due to:\n\u2022a $0.5 million decrease in Cloud revenues is primarily due to the extension of a significant commercial arrangement which extended recognition of deferred revenue across the term of the new contract, partially offset by increased subscriber growth and professional services revenue.\n\u2022a $2.3 million increase in Digital revenues is primarily driven an uptick in subscription services partially offset by a reduction in professional service business.\n\u2022an $18.8 million decrease in Messaging revenues was primarily driven by a significant 2019 non-recurring license and professional services revenue deal in advanced messaging. This revenue change was partially offset by favorable license renewals in 2020.\nNet revenues decreased $17.1 million to $308.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018. The overall change is due to:\n\u2022a $0.1 million increase in Cloud revenues due to a decrease in transaction revenue of $3.4 million offset by an increase in subscription revenue of $2.8 million and an increase in professional services revenue of $0.7 million.\n\u2022a $45.6 million decrease in Digital Transformation revenues is primarily driven by changes to the STIN business that led the Company to conclude that its collection of certain STIN receivables is no longer probable. In accordance with ASC 842, the portion of revenue that is no longer deemed collectible is reversed in the current period against revenue. Accordingly, the Company determined a contingency reserve is required, which was included as a reduction of revenue. The year over year change to STIN revenue was in excess of $34.6 million. The remaining change is primarily driven by a decline in business activity.\n\u2022an increase in Messaging revenues of $28.4 million primarily due to a growth in advanced messaging in North America as well as the continued delivery of an advanced messaging solution to a customer in the Japanese market.\nCost of revenues decreased $28.6 million to $121.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. The 2020 decrease was primarily attributable to the year over year reduction in revenue and the cost savings from strategic initiatives implemented in the year driven mainly by data center consolidation and operating expense savings.\nCost of revenues decreased $8.4 million to $150.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018. The 2019 decrease was primarily due to cost savings initiatives implemented in 2018 and continuing into 2019. These initiatives resulted in a decrease in cost of revenues driven mainly by data center consolidation and operating expense savings.\nResearch and development expense increased $1.5 million to $77.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. The increase in 2020 is primarily related to the costs associated with the impairment of\nthe right of use assets. Excluding the impairment charges incurred in 2020, the research and development costs decreased year over year mainly as a result of executed cost savings initiatives to streamline our workforce and reduce vendor spend.\nResearch and development expense decreased $3.6 million to $75.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018. The decrease in 2019 is primarily due to the realization of our strategic efforts to reduce costs and refocus our resources on key strategic priorities. These efforts resulted in decreased personnel related costs including stock-based compensation expense.\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased $23.5 million to $89.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. The 2020 decrease was primarily attributable to significant cost cutting initiatives executed in year which included headcount reductions, reduced vendor spending and lower facility costs offset by impairments to our right of use assets.\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased $9.3 million to $112.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018. The 2019 decrease was primarily due to a net reduction in professional services and outside consulting fees incurred and lower telecommunication and facility costs offset by a right of use asset impairment.\nRestructuring charges were $8.0 million, $0.8 million and $12.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively. The 2020 restructuring costs was primarily driven by our strategic cost savings initiatives to streamline our business operations and reduce headcount. 2019 restructuring costs were primarily related to employment termination costs as a result of the work-force reduction and facility consolidation plans. In prior years, we commenced separate plans designed to reduce operating costs and align our resources with our key strategic priorities, which resulted in work-force reductions and facility consolidations.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $33.4 million to $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. The 2020 decrease was primarily attributable to the expiration of amortizable acquired assets and a reduction in capital expenditures. These changes were partially offset by the increased amortization of capitalized software.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $40.6 million to $77.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018. The 2019 decrease was primarily attributable to the expiration of amortizable acquired assets, a reduction in capital expenditures, and the one-time Zentry, LLC ( Zentry\u201d) impairment charge in 2018. These changes were partially offset by the increased amortization of capitalized software.\nIncome tax. The Company recognized approximately $27.1 million in related income tax benefit and $2.2 million in related income tax provision during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The effective tax rate was approximately 72.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of the CARES Act provision allowing for a 5 year carryback of Net Operating Losses arising in 2018, 2019 and 2020. The Company's effective tax rate was approximately (2.1)% for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to pre-tax losses in jurisdictions where full valuation allowances have been recorded and in zero tax rate jurisdictions and permanent differences associated with U.S. Base Erosion and Anti Abuse Tax elections, offset by certain foreign jurisdictions projecting current income tax expense.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations. Our cash and cash equivalents balance was $33.7 million at December 31, 2020. We anticipate that our principal uses of cash and cash equivalents will be to fund our business, including technology expansion and working capital.\nAt December 31, 2020, our non-U.S. subsidiaries held approximately $6.2 million of cash and cash equivalents that are available for use by all of our operations around the world. At this time, we believe the funds held by all non-U.S. subsidiaries will be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. However, if these funds were repatriated to the U.S. or used for U.S. operations, certain amounts could be subject to U.S. tax for the incremental amount in excess of the foreign tax paid. Due to the timing and circumstances of repatriation of these earnings, if any, it is not practical to determine the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the amount.\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, credit facility, and our ability to manage working capital and expected positive cash flows generated from operations in combination with continued expense reductions will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months from the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, as the impact of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and our operations evolves, we will continue to assess our liquidity needs. Given the economic uncertainty as a result of the pandemic, we have taken actions to improve our current liquidity position, including, reducing working capital, reducing operating costs and substantially reducing discretionary spending. Even with these actions however, an extended period of economic disruption as a result of COVID-19 could materially affect our business, results of operations, ability to meet debt covenants, access to sources of liquidity and financial condition. Our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" section of this MD&A and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d, some of which are outside of our control.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nThe Company paid off the remaining carrying amount of the convertible senior notes on August 15, 2019. For further details, see Note 12. Debt of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n2019 Revolving Credit Facility\nOn October 4, 2019, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement with Citizens Bank, N.A., for a $10.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Company's option, either (1) the arithmetic average of the LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period (one, three or six months (or 12 months if agreed to by all applicable Lenders)) as selected by the Company relevant to such borrowing plus the applicable margin, or (2) a base rate determined by reference to the greatest of the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, the prime commercial lending rate as determined by the Agent, and the daily LIBOR rate plus 1.00%, in each case plus an applicable margin and subject to a floor of 0.00%. In addition, on a quarterly basis, the Company is required to pay each lender under the Revolving Credit Facility a 0.2% commitment fee on the undrawn balance under the Revolving Credit Facility, which may be subject to adjustment based on the Company's total leverage ratio.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company drew the $10.0 million from our Revolving Credit Facility, which remains outstanding as of December 31, 2020.\nShares of Preferred Stock\nIn accordance with the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement dated as of October 17, 2017 (the PIPE Purchase Agreement\u201d), with Silver Private Holdings I, LLC, an affiliate of Siris ( Silver\u201d), on February 15, 2018, we issued to Silver 185,000 shares of our newly issued Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, with an initial liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, in exchange for $97.7 million in cash and the transfer from Silver to us of the 5,994,667 shares of our common stock held by Silver (the Preferred Transaction\u201d). In connection with the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock, we (i) filed the Series A Certificate and (ii) entered into an Investor Rights Agreement with Silver setting forth certain registration, governance and preemptive rights of Silver with respect to us (the Investor Rights Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the PIPE Purchase Agreement, at the closing, we paid to Siris $5.0 million as a reimbursement of Silver's costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Preferred Transaction.\nCertificate of Designation of the Series A Preferred Stock\nThe rights, preferences, privileges, qualifications, restrictions and limitations of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are set forth in the Series A Certificate. Under the Series A Certificate, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive Preferred Dividends. The Preferred Dividends are due on each Series A Dividend Payment Date. We may choose to pay the Preferred Dividends in cash or in additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock. In the event we do not declare and pay a dividend in-kind or in cash on any Series A Dividend Payment Date, the unpaid amount of the Preferred Dividend will be added to the Liquidation Preference. In addition, the Series A Preferred Stock participates in dividends declared and paid on shares of our common stock.\nEach share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into the number of shares of common stock equal to the Conversion Price\u201d (as that term is defined in the Series A Certificate) multiplied by the then applicable Conversion Rate\u201d (as that term is defined in the Series A Certificate). Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is initially convertible into 55.5556 shares of common stock, representing an initial conversion price\u201d of approximately $18.00 per share of common stock. The Conversion Rate is subject to equitable proportionate adjustment in the event of stock splits, recapitalizations and other events set forth in the Series A Certificate.\nOn and after the fifth anniversary of February 15, 2018, holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to cause the Company to redeem each share of Series A Preferred Stock for cash in an amount equal to the sum of the current\nliquidation preference and any accrued dividends. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is also redeemable at the option of the holder upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change\u201d (as that term is defined in the Series A Certificate) at a specified premium ( Liquidation Value\u201d). In addition, the Company is also permitted to redeem all outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock at any time (i) within the first 30 months of the date of issuance for the sum of the then-applicable Liquidation Preference, accrued but unpaid dividends and a make whole amount (known as Redemption Value\u201d) and (ii) following the 30-month anniversary of the date of issuance for the sum of the then-applicable Liquidation Preference and the accrued but unpaid dividends. As of December 31, 2020, the Liquidation Value and Redemption Value of the Preferred Shares was $243.1 million.\nThe holders of a majority of the Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class, are entitled at each of our annual meetings of stockholders or at any special meeting called for the purpose of electing directors (or by written consent signed by the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock in lieu of such a meeting): (i) to nominate and elect two members of our Board of Directors for so long as the Preferred Percentage (as defined in the Series A Certificate) is equal to or greater than 10%; and (ii) to nominate and elect one member of our Board of Directors for so long as the Preferred Percentage is equal to or greater than 5% but less than 10%.\nFor so long as the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to nominate at least one director, we are required to obtain the prior approval of Silver prior to taking certain actions, including: (i) certain dividends, repayments and redemptions; (ii) any amendment to our certificate of incorporation that adversely effects the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock; (iii) issuances of stock ranking senior or equivalent to shares of Series A Preferred Stock (including additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock) in the priority of payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of us; (iv) changes in the size of our Board of Directors; (v) any amendment, alteration, modification or repeal of the charter of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors and related documents; and (vi) any change in our principal business or the entry into any line of business outside of our existing lines of businesses. In addition, in the event that we are in EBITDA Non-Compliance (as defined in the Series A Certificate) or the undertaking of certain actions would result in us exceeding a specified pro forma leverage ratio, then the prior approval of Silver would be required to incur indebtedness (or alter any debt document) in excess of $10.0 million, enter or consummate any transaction where the fair market value exceeds $5.0 million individually or $10.0 million in the aggregate in a fiscal year or authorize or commit to capital expenditures in excess of $25.0 million in a fiscal year.\nEach holder of Series A Preferred Stock has one vote per share on any matter on which holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote separately as a class, whether at a meeting or by written consent. The holders of Series A Preferred Stock are permitted to take any action or consent to any action with respect to such rights without a meeting by delivering a consent in writing or electronic transmission of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock entitled to cast not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize, take or consent to such action at a meeting of stockholders. In addition to any vote (or action taken by written consent) of the holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock as a separate class provided for in the Series A Certificate or by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote with the holders of shares of common stock (and any other class or series that may similarly be entitled to vote on an as-converted basis with the holders of common stock) on all matters submitted to a vote or to the consent of the stockholders of the Company (including the election of directors) as one class.\nUnder the Series A Certificate, if Silver and certain of its affiliates have elected to effect a conversion of some or all of their shares of Series A Preferred Stock and if the sum, without duplication, of (i) the aggregate number of shares of our common stock issued to such holders upon such conversion and any shares of our common stock previously issued to such holders upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock and then held by such holders, plus (ii) the number of shares of our common stock underlying shares of Series A Preferred Stock that would be held at such time by such holders (after giving effect to such conversion), would exceed the 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of our voting stock on an as converted basis (the Conversion Cap\u201d), then such holders would only be entitled to convert such number of shares as would result in the sum of clauses (i) and (ii) (after giving effect to such conversion) being equal to the Conversion Cap (after giving effect to any such limitation on conversion). Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock which a holder has elected to convert but which, by reason of the previous sentence, are not so converted, will be treated as if the holder had not made such election to convert and such shares of Series A Preferred Stock will remain outstanding. Also, under the Series A Certificate, if the sum, without duplication, of (i) the aggregate voting power of the shares previously issued to Silver and certain of its affiliates held by such holders at the record date, plus (ii) the aggregate voting power of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such holders as of such record date, would exceed 19.99% of the total voting power of our outstanding voting stock at such record date, then, with respect to such shares, Silver and certain of its affiliates are only entitled to cast a number of votes equal to 19.99% of such total voting power. The limitation on conversion and voting ceases to apply upon receipt of the requisite approval of holders of our common stock under the applicable listing standards.\nInvestor Rights Agreement\nConcurrently with the closing of the Preferred Transaction, Synchronoss and Silver entered into an Investor Rights Agreement. Under the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, Silver and Synchronoss have agreed that, effective as of the closing of the Preferred Transaction, the Board of Directors of Synchronoss will consist of ten members. From and after the closing of the Preferred Transaction, so long as the holders of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to nominate a member to the Board of Directors pursuant to the Series A Certificate, the Board of Directors of Synchronoss will consist of (i) two directors nominated and elected by the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock; (ii) four directors who meet the independence criteria set forth in the applicable listing standards (each of whom will be initially agreed upon by Synchronoss and Silver); and (iii) four other directors, two of whom shall satisfy the independence criteria of the applicable listing standards and, as of the closing of the Preferred Transaction, one of whom shall be the individual then serving as chief executive officer of Synchronoss and one of whom shall be the current chairman of the Board of Directors of Synchronoss as of the date of execution of the Investors Rights Agreement. Following the closing of the Preferred Transaction, so long as the holders of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to nominate at least one director to the Board of Directors of Synchronoss pursuant to the Series A Certificate, Silver will have the right to designate two members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors.\nPursuant to the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, neither Silver nor its affiliates may transfer any shares of Series A Preferred Stock subject to certain exceptions (including transfers to affiliates that agree to be bound by the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement).\nFor so long as Silver has the right to appoint a director to the Board of Directors of Synchronoss, without the prior approval by a majority of directors voting who are not appointed by the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, neither Silver nor its affiliates will directly or indirectly purchase or acquire any debt or equity securities of Synchronoss (including equity-linked derivative securities) if such purchase or acquisition would result in Silver's Standstill Percentage (as defined in the Investor Rights Agreement) being in excess of 30%. However, the foregoing standstill restrictions would not prohibit the purchase of shares pursuant to the PIPE Purchase Agreement or the receipt of shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued as Preferred Dividends pursuant to the Series A Certificate, shares of Common Stock received upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock or receipt of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Common Stock or other securities of the Company otherwise paid as dividends or as an increase of the Liquidation Preference (as defined in the Series A Certificate) or distributions thereon. Silver will also have preemptive rights with respect to issuances of securities of Synchronoss in order to maintain its ownership percentage.\nUnder the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, Silver will be entitled to (i) three demand registrations, with no more than two demand registrations in any single calendar year and provided that each demand registration must include at least 10% of the shares of Common Stock held by Silver, including shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and (ii) unlimited piggyback registration rights with respect to primary issuances and all other issuances.\nDiscussion of Cash Flows\nA summary of net cash flows follows (in thousands):\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 vs 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(564) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,583 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(31,369) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(33,147) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63,952 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities </td> <td>(14,339) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,377 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(67,282) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33,716) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86,659 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td>9,991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(121,257) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35,885) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>131,248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(85,372) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. The primary uses of cash are personnel and related costs, telecommunications and facility costs related primarily to our cost of revenue and general operating expenses including professional service fees, consulting fees, building and equipment maintenance and marketing expense.\nCash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was a $0.6 million of cash used by operating activities, as compared to $32.6 million of cash provided by operating activities for the same period in 2019. The decrease of cash used by operating activities of $33.1 million was primarily due to favorable changes in cash earnings of $21.4 million offset by an unfavorable change in working capital of $70.2 million. The main driver of the unfavorable movement in working\ncapital was the continued run-off of the deferred revenue balance which is in line with our business as our customers shift away from larger prepayments of services.\nCash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $32.6 million of cash provided by operating activities, as compared to $31.4 million of cash used by operating activities for the same period in 2018. The increase of cash provided by operating activities of $64.0 million was primarily due to favorable changes in cash earnings of $16.1 million, a $20.7 million tax refund and a favorable change in working capital of $27.1 million.\nCash flows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $14.3 million of cash used by investing activities, as compared to $19.4 million in cash provided by investing activities during the same period in 2019. The cash used for investing in the current year was primarily related to the $16.7 million investment in capitalized software offset by the sale of certain IP address assets. The net decrease in cash from investing activities from the prior year mainly related to the net proceeds from the purchases and sales of marketable securities in the prior year that were not present in the current period.\nCash flows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $19.4 million of cash provided by investing activities, as compared to $67.3 million in cash used for investing activities during the same period in 2018. The 2019 cash provided from investing activities was driven by the sale of marketable securities offset by our continued investment in capitalized software. The increased spend in 2018 was due primarily to purchase marketable securities and fund the Honeybee acquisition.\nCash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $10.0 million of cash provided, as compared to $121.3 million of cash used by financing activities for the same period in 2019. The cash provided from investing activities was attributable to the $10.0 million drawdown from our Revolving Credit Facility. The net change in cash provided from financing activities from the prior year is primarily attributable to the cash provided from the Revolving Credit Facility offset by repayments for our Convertible Senior Notes in 2019.\nCash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $121.3 million use of cash, as compared to $35.9 million of cash used by financing activities for the same period in 2018. The cash used for financing activities was mainly attributable to the repayment of the convertible debt in August 2019.\nEffect of Inflation\nAlthough inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and equipment, we do not believe that inflation has had any material effect on our results of operations during 2020, 2019 and 2018. We do not expect the current rate of inflation to have a material impact on our business for the foreseeable future.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations consist of contingent consideration, office equipment and colocation services and contractual commitments under third-party hosting, software licenses and maintenance agreements. The following table summarizes our long-term contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands).\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022-2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>2025-2026 </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance lease obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>258 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>171 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,273 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,367 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,594 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations* </td> <td> </td> <td>58,222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,632 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,891 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,699 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>127,480 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,066 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,594 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________\n* Amount represents customer delivery related purchase obligations.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nUnrecognized tax positions are $3.3 million at December 31, 2020. We are not able to reasonably estimate when we would make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities, but we do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity. We do not expect that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease over the next twelve months.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a fiscal period. We have discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this Form 10-K. Although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate, correct and reasonable under the circumstances, actual results may differ from those estimates. If actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates, our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K for certain matters bearing risks on our future results of operations.\nWe believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations and they require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain.\nSignificant accounting policies that we employ are presented in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. There were no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in our Form 10-K during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nThe Company generates revenue from the delivery of a range of products, solutions and services for operators, enterprises, OEMs and technology providers. We offer services principally on a Transactional or Subscription basis (SaaS) or in the form of Professional Services or Software Licenses. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to the Company's customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company generates all of its revenue from contracts with customers.\nSubscription and Transaction revenues consist of revenues derived from the processing of transactions through the Company's service platforms, providing enterprise portal management services on a subscription basis and maintenance agreements on software licenses. The Company generates revenue from Subscription services from monthly active user fees, software as a service ( SaaS\u201d) fees, hosting and storage fees, and fees for the related maintenance support for those services. In most cases, the subscription or transaction arrangement is a single performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer (i.e., distinct days of service). The Company applies a measure of progress (typically time-based) to any fixed consideration and allocates variable consideration to the distinct periods of service based on usage, under Topic 606 Section 10-25-14(b). When the Company does not allocate variable consideration to distinct periods of service, the total estimated transaction price is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, where the level of service provided to the customer does not vary significantly from one period to another.\nTransaction service arrangements include services such as processing equipment orders, new account setup and activation, number port requests, credit checks and inventory management. Transaction revenues are principally based on a contractual price per transaction and are recognized based on the number of transactions processed during each reporting period. Revenues are recorded based on the total number of transactions processed at the applicable price established in the relevant contract.\nMany of the Company's contracts guarantee minimum volume transactions from the customer. In these instances, if the customer's total estimated transaction volume for the period is expected to be less than the contractual amount, the Company records revenues at the minimum guaranteed amount on a straight line based over the period covered by the minimum. Setup fees for transactional service arrangements are deferred until set up activities are completed and recognized on a straight-line basis over remaining expected customer relationship period. Revenues are presented net of discounts, which are volume level driven.\nIn accordance with Topic 606 Section 10-50-20, any credits due to customers, which are generally performance driven and based upon system availability or response times to incidents, are determined and accounted for in the period in which the services are provided. The Company recognizes revenues from support and maintenance performance obligations over the service delivery period.\nThe Company's software licenses typically provide for a perpetual or term right to use the Company's software. The Company has concluded that in most cases its software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered to the customer. Contracts that include software customization or specified upgrades may result in the combination of the customization services with the software license as one performance obligation. The Company does not have a history of returns, or refunds of is software licenses, however, in limited instances, the Company may constrain consideration to high-risk customers, until collection is resolved.\nThe Company's professional services include software development and customization. The contracts generally include project deliverables specified by each customer. The performance obligations in the agreements are generally combined into one deliverable and generally result in the transfer of control over time. The underlying deliverable is owned and controlled by the customer and does not create an asset with an alternative use to us. The Company recognizes revenue on fixed fee contracts on the proportion of labor hours expended to the total hours expected to complete the contract performance obligation.\nMost of the Company's contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations which generally include either 1) a perpetual software license with support and maintenance and sometimes a hosting agreement or 2) a term SaaS agreement, in many cases these are sold along with professional services. For these contracts, the Company accounts for individual goods and services separately if they are distinct performance obligations. This often requires significant judgment based upon knowledge of the products, the solution provided and the structure of the sales contract. In SaaS agreements, the Company provides a service to the customer which combines the software functionality, maintenance and hosting into a single performance obligation when the customer doesn't have the ability to take possession of the underlying software license. The Company may also sell the same three goods and services in a contract, but there may be three performance obligations, where the customer has the right to take possession of the software license without significant penalty.\nThe transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. The Company estimates standalone selling prices of software based on observable inputs of past transactions to similarly situated customers. When such observable data is not available for certain software licenses because there is a limited number of transactions or prices are highly variable, the Company will estimate the standalone selling price using the residual approach. Standalone selling prices of services are typically determined based on observable transactions when these services are sold on a standalone basis to similarly situated customers or estimated using a cost-plus margin approach.\nEstimating the transaction price of variable consideration including the variable quantity subscription or transaction contracts in a multiple performance obligation arrangement requires significant judgment. The Company generally estimates this variable consideration at the most likely amount to which the Company expects to be entitled and in certain cases based on the expected value. The Company includes estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The Company's estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of the Company's anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. The Company reviews and updates these estimates on a quarterly basis.\nStock-Based Compensation\nAs of December 31, 2020, we maintain eight stock-based compensation plans. We utilize the Black-Scholes pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options on the dates of grant. Restricted stock awards are measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. We recognize stock-based compensation over the requisite service period with an offsetting credit to additional paid-in capital.\nFor our performance restricted stock awards and units, we estimate the number of shares the recipient is to receive by applying a probability of achieving the performance goals. The actual number of shares the recipient receives is determined at the end of the performance period based on the results achieved versus goals based on our performance targets, such as revenue, EBITDA and Total Shareholder Return (TSR). Once the number of awards is determined, the compensation cost is fixed and continues to be recognized using straight line recognition over the requisite service period for each vesting tranche.\nUse of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical information of our stock. The average expected life was determined using historical stock option exercise activity. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common equity and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\nIncome Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted TCJA. The TCJA made changes to the corporate tax rate, business-related deductions and taxation of foreign earnings, among others, that are generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.\nIn March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ( CARES Act\u201d) was signed into law. The CARES Act provides numerous tax provisions and other stimulus measures, including temporary changes regarding the prior and future utilization of net operating losses. The CARES Act amends the Net Operating Loss provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, allowing for the carryback of losses arising in tax years 2018, 2019 and 2020, to each of the five taxable years preceding the taxable year of loss.\nSince we conduct operations on a global basis, our effective tax rate has and will depend upon the geographic distribution of our pre-tax earnings among locations with varying tax rates. We account for the effects of income taxes that result from our activities during the current and preceding years. Under this method, deferred income tax liabilities and assets are based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse or be utilized. The realization of deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income. A valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not\u201d that a portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax-planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.\nWe recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. The amount of the accrual for which an exposure exists is measured by determining the amount that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon the settlement of the position. Components of the reserve are classified as current or a long-term liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on when we expect each of the items to be settled. We record interest and penalties accrued in relation to uncertain tax benefits as a component of interest expense.\nWhile we believe we have identified all reasonably identifiable exposures and that the reserve we have established for identifiable exposures is appropriate under the circumstances, it is possible that additional exposures exist and that exposures may be settled at amounts different than the amounts reserved. It is also possible that changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to either materially increase or reduce the carrying amount of our tax reserves. In general, tax returns for the year 2017 and thereafter are subject to future examination by tax authorities.\nOur policy has been to leave our cumulative unremitted foreign earnings invested indefinitely outside the United States, and we intend to continue this policy. Although the transition tax in the TCJA has removed U.S. federal taxes on distributions to the U.S. on a go forward basis, the Company continues to assert permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings. Due to the timing and circumstances of repatriation of such earnings, if any, it is not practicable to determine the unrecognized deferred tax liability relating to such amounts.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations in accordance with the acquisition method. The acquisition method of accounting requires that assets acquired, and liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree (if any), be recorded at their fair values on the date of a business acquisition. Our consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business from the completion date of the transaction.\nThe judgments that we make in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact net income in periods following a business combination. We generally use either the income, cost or market approach to aid in our conclusions of such fair values and asset lives. The income approach presumes that the value of an asset can be estimated by the net economic benefit to be received over the life of the\nasset, discounted to present value. The cost approach presumes that an investor would pay no more for an asset than its replacement or reproduction cost. The market approach estimates value based on what other participants in the market have paid for reasonably similar assets. Although each valuation approach is considered in valuing the assets acquired, the approach ultimately selected is based on the characteristics of the asset and the availability of information.\nWe record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. Each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to net change in contingent consideration obligation within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation can result from updates in the achievement of financial or other operational targets and changes to the weighted probability of achieving those future targets. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, any change in the assumptions described above, could have a material impact on the amount of the net change in contingent consideration obligation that we record in any given period.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired, including other definite-lived intangible assets. Our policy is to perform an impairment test of goodwill at least annually, and more frequently if events or circumstances occurred that would indicate a reduced fair value in our reporting units could exist. Typically, we perform a qualitative assessment in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. As part of this qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative assessment where necessary in substantiating our qualitative assessment.\nDuring our qualitative assessment we make significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments, around the financial performance of the Company, changes in our share price, and forecasts of earnings, working capital requirements, and cash flows. We consider each reporting unit's historical results and operating trends as well as any strategic difference from our historical results when determining these assumptions.\nIf we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. Fair value estimates used in the quantitative impairment test are calculated using a combination of the income and market approaches. The income approach is based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit, while the market approach is based on certain multiples of selected guideline public companies or selected guideline transactions. The approaches incorporate a number of market participant assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, income tax rates and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. If the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.\nThe fair value measurement associated with the quantitative goodwill impairment test is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. Significant changes in the underlying assumptions used to value goodwill could significantly increase or decrease the fair value estimates used for impairment assessments.\nFor our 2020 impairment tests, the Company identified one reporting unit, Core. The Company performed a quantitative impairment assessment, as of October 1, 2020, for the Core reporting unit. The amounts below represent the results of our quantitative assessment.\nWe use the average of our fair values for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the quantitative impairment test. The table below depicts the methods employed, assumptions used and percentage fair value in excess of carrying value.\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 Impairment Test </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reporting Unit </td> <td>Discount Rate </td> <td>Growth rate range </td> <td>Terminal Growth Rate </td> <td>Goodwill </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value Exceeds Carrying Value by </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value method </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core </td> <td>13.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td>2.0 - 13.0% </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>227,012 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>Income Approach, Market Approach </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 2020 fair value of the reporting unit was estimated using a combination of the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method, and the market approach, which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue\nmultiples based on market data. We generally applied an equal weighting to the income and market approaches for our analysis when both are applied.\nFor the income approach, we used projections, which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions. Factors specific to each reporting unit include revenue and cost growth, profit margins, terminal value growth rates, capital expenditures projections, assumed tax rates, discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management.\nFor the market approach, we used judgment in identifying the relevant comparable-company market multiples. These estimates and assumptions may vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that unit. If sufficient comparable data is not present, the market approach will not be employed. The discount rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit.\nFactors influencing the revenue growth rates include the nature of the services the reporting unit provides for its clients, the maturity of the reporting unit and any known concentrated customer contract renewals. We believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable, but they are susceptible to change from period to period. Actual results of operations, cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation, and it is possible that differences and changes could be material.\nA deterioration in profitability, adverse market conditions, significant client losses, changes in spending levels of our existing clients or a different economic outlook than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge in the future.\nCapitalized Software Development Costs\nSoftware development costs are accounted for in accordance with either ASC 985-20, Software - Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or Marketed,\u201d or ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software.\u201d Costs associated with the planning and designing phase of software development are classified as research and development costs and are expensed as incurred. The amounts capitalized include external direct costs of services used in developing internal-use software, employee compensation and related expenses of personnel directly associated with the development activities. Once technological feasibility has been determined, a portion of the costs incurred in development, including coding, testing and quality assurance, are capitalized until available for general release to clients.\nAmortization is calculated on a solution-by-solution basis and is recognized over the estimated economic life of the software, typically ranging two to three years. Amortization begins when the software is substantially completed for its intended use. Costs incurred during the preliminary and post-implementation stages are expensed as incurred. The amounts capitalized include external direct costs of services used in developing internal-use software, employee compensation and related expenses of personnel directly associated with the development activities. Software development costs are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Unrecoverable costs are reviewed annually and recognized in the period they become unrecoverable, as needed, and are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as depreciation and amortization expense.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nA review of long-lived assets for impairment is performed when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. If an indication of impairment is present, the Company compares the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the asset to the asset's carrying amount. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, the Company records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its fair value. The fair value is determined based on valuation techniques such as a comparison to fair values of similar assets or using a discounted cash flow analysis.\nThis fair value measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. Significant changes in the underlying assumptions used to value long lived assets could significantly increase or decrease the fair value estimates used for impairment assessments.\nLong lived assets that do not have indefinite lives are amortized/depreciated over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company reevaluates the useful life determinations each year to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining useful lives.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nFor a discussion of recently issued accounting standards see Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.", "item_7_truncated": "In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ( CARES Act\u201d) was signed into law. The CARES Act provides numerous tax provisions and other stimulus measures, including temporary changes regarding the prior and future utilization of net operating losses. The CARES Act amends the Net Operating Loss provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, allowing for the carryback of losses arising in tax years 2018, 2019 and 2020, to each of the five taxable years preceding the taxable year of loss.\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 vs 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(564) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,583 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(31,369) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(33,147) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63,952 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities </td> <td>(14,339) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,377 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(67,282) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33,716) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86,659 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td>9,991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(121,257) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35,885) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>131,248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(85,372) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEstimating the transaction price of variable consideration including the variable quantity subscription or transaction contracts in a multiple performance obligation arrangement requires significant judgment. The Company generally estimates this variable consideration at the most likely amount to which the Company expects to be entitled and in certain cases based on the expected value. The Company includes estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The Company's estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of the Company's anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. The Company reviews and updates these estimates on a quarterly basis.\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022-2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>2025-2026 </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance lease obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>258 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>171 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,273 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,367 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,594 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations* </td> <td> </td> <td>58,222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,632 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,891 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,699 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>127,480 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,066 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,594 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubscription and Transaction revenues consist of revenues derived from the processing of transactions through the Company's service platforms, providing enterprise portal management services on a subscription basis and maintenance agreements on software licenses. The Company generates revenue from Subscription services from monthly active user fees, software as a service ( SaaS\u201d) fees, hosting and storage fees, and fees for the related maintenance support for those services. In most cases, the subscription or transaction arrangement is a single performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer (i.e., distinct days of service). The Company applies a measure of progress (typically time-based) to any fixed consideration and allocates variable consideration to the distinct periods of service based on usage, under Topic 606 Section 10-25-14(b). When the Company does not allocate variable consideration to distinct periods of service, the total estimated transaction price is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, where the level of service provided to the customer does not vary significantly from one period to another.\nOur contractual obligations consist of contingent consideration, office equipment and colocation services and contractual commitments under third-party hosting, software licenses and maintenance agreements. The following table summarizes our long-term contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands).\nEffect of Inflation\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 Impairment Test </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reporting Unit </td> <td>Discount Rate </td> <td>Growth rate range </td> <td>Terminal Growth Rate </td> <td>Goodwill </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value Exceeds Carrying Value by </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value method </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core </td> <td>13.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td>2.0 - 13.0% </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>227,012 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>Income Approach, Market Approach </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company generates revenue from the delivery of a range of products, solutions and services for operators, enterprises, OEMs and technology providers. We offer services principally on a Transactional or Subscription basis (SaaS) or in the form of Professional Services or Software Licenses. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to the Company's customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.

Amortization begins when the software is substantially completed for its intended use. Costs incurred during the preliminary and post-implementation stages are expensed as incurred. The amounts capitalized include external direct costs of services used in developing internal-use software, employee compensation and related expenses of personnel directly associated with the development activities. Software development costs are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Unrecoverable costs are reviewed annually and recognized in the period they become unrecoverable, as needed, and are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as depreciation and amortization expense.\nRevenues\nUse of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical information of our stock. The average expected life was determined using historical stock option exercise activity. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common equity and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\nCertificate of Designation of the Series A Preferred Stock\nUncertain Tax Positions\nUnder the Series A Certificate, if Silver and certain of its affiliates have elected to effect a conversion of some or all of their shares of Series A Preferred Stock and if the sum, without duplication, of (i) the aggregate number of shares of our common stock issued to such holders upon such conversion and any shares of our common stock previously issued to such holders upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock and then held by such holders, plus (ii) the number of shares of our common stock underlying shares of Series A Preferred Stock that would be held at such time by such holders (after giving effect to such conversion), would exceed the 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of our voting stock on an as converted basis (the Conversion Cap\u201d), then such holders would only be entitled to convert such number of shares as would result in the sum of clauses (i) and (ii) (after giving effect to such conversion) being equal to the Conversion Cap (after giving effect to any such limitation on conversion). Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock which a holder has elected to convert but which, by reason of the previous sentence, are not so converted, will be treated as if the holder had not made such election to convert and such shares of Series A Preferred Stock will remain outstanding. Also, under the Series A Certificate, if the sum, without duplication, of (i) the aggregate voting power of the shares previously issued to Silver and certain of its affiliates held by such holders at the record date, plus (ii) the aggregate voting power of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such holders as of such record date, would exceed 19.99% of the total voting power of our outstanding voting stock at such record date, then, with respect to such shares, Silver and certain of its affiliates are only entitled to cast a number of votes equal to 19.99% of such total voting power. The limitation on conversion and voting ceases to apply upon receipt of the requisite approval of holders of our common stock under the applicable listing standards.\nCapitalized Software Development Costs\n\nThe Company's professional services include software development and customization. The contracts generally include project deliverables specified by each customer. The performance obligations in the agreements are generally combined into one deliverable and generally result in the transfer of control over time. The underlying deliverable is owned and controlled by the customer and does not create an asset with an alternative use to us. The Company recognizes revenue on fixed fee contracts on the proportion of labor hours expended to the total hours expected to complete the contract performance obligation.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. The MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn response to COVID-19, we have been executing our business continuity plans and evolving our operations to protect the safety of our employees while continuing to provide critical products and services to our customers. Some of the initiatives the Company has undertaken include:\nDuring our qualitative assessment we make significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments, around the financial performance of the Company, changes in our share price, and forecasts of earnings, working capital requirements, and cash flows. We consider each reporting unit's historical results and operating trends as well as any strategic difference from our historical results when determining these assumptions.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe future success of our business depends on the continued growth of Business-to-Business and Business-to-Business-to-Consumer driving customer transactions, and continued expansion of our platforms into the TMT Market globally through Cloud, Messaging and Digital markets. As such, the volume of transactions and our ability to expand our footprint in TMT and globally may result in revenue fluctuations on a quarterly basis.\nThis disclosure discusses the actions the Company has taken in response to the COVID-19 crisis and the impacts that it has had on our business, as well as related known or expected trends.\n* Cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization which are shown separately.\nThe fair value measurement associated with the quantitative goodwill impairment test is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. Significant changes in the underlying assumptions used to value goodwill could significantly increase or decrease the fair value estimates used for impairment assessments.\nFor so long as Silver has the right to appoint a director to the Board of Directors of Synchronoss, without the prior approval by a majority of directors voting who are not appointed by the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, neither Silver nor its affiliates will directly or indirectly purchase or acquire any debt or equity securities of Synchronoss (including equity-linked derivative securities) if such purchase or acquisition would result in Silver's Standstill Percentage (as defined in the Investor Rights Agreement) being in excess of 30%. However, the foregoing standstill restrictions would not prohibit the purchase of shares pursuant to the PIPE Purchase Agreement or the receipt of shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued as Preferred Dividends pursuant to the Series A Certificate, shares of Common Stock received upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock or receipt of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Common Stock or other securities of the Company otherwise paid as dividends or as an increase of the Liquidation Preference (as defined in the Series A Certificate) or distributions thereon. Silver will also have preemptive rights with respect to issuances of securities of Synchronoss in order to maintain its ownership percentage.\nWhile we believe we have identified all reasonably identifiable exposures and that the reserve we have established for identifiable exposures is appropriate under the circumstances, it is possible that additional exposures exist and that exposures may be settled at amounts different than the amounts reserved. It is also possible that changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to either materially increase or reduce the carrying amount of our tax reserves. In general, tax returns for the year 2017 and thereafter are subject to future examination by tax authorities.\nPursuant to the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, neither Silver nor its affiliates may transfer any shares of Series A Preferred Stock subject to certain exceptions (including transfers to affiliates that agree to be bound by the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement).\nIncome tax. The Company recognized approximately $27.1 million in related income tax benefit and $2.2 million in related income tax provision during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The effective tax rate was approximately 72.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of the CARES Act provision allowing for a 5 year carryback of Net Operating Losses arising in 2018, 2019 and 2020. The Company's effective tax rate was approximately (2.1)% for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to pre-tax losses in jurisdictions where full valuation allowances have been recorded and in zero tax rate jurisdictions and permanent differences associated with U.S. Base Erosion and Anti Abuse Tax elections, offset by certain foreign jurisdictions projecting current income tax expense.\nFor the income approach, we used projections, which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions. Factors specific to each reporting unit include revenue and cost growth, profit margins, terminal value growth rates, capital expenditures projections, assumed tax rates, discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted TCJA. The TCJA made changes to the corporate tax rate, business-related deductions and taxation of foreign earnings, among others, that are generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $33.4 million to $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. The 2020 decrease was primarily attributable to the expiration of amortizable acquired assets and a reduction in capital expenditures. These changes were partially offset by the increased amortization of capitalized software.\nMost of our revenues are recorded in U.S. dollars but as we continue to expand our footprint with international carriers, we will become subject to currency translation that could affect our future net sales as reported in U.S. dollars.\nthe right of use assets. Excluding the impairment charges incurred in 2020, the research and development costs decreased year over year mainly as a result of executed cost savings initiatives to streamline our workforce and reduce vendor spend.\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased $23.5 million to $89.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. The 2020 decrease was primarily attributable to significant cost cutting initiatives executed in year which included headcount reductions, reduced vendor spending and lower facility costs offset by impairments to our right of use assets.\ncapital was the continued run-off of the deferred revenue balance which is in line with our business as our customers shift away from larger prepayments of services.\n________________________________\n\u2022Maintaining effective governance and internal controls in a remote work environment\nResearch and development expense decreased $3.6 million to $75.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018. The decrease in 2019 is primarily due to the realization of our strategic efforts to reduce costs and refocus our resources on key strategic priorities. These efforts resulted in decreased personnel related costs including stock-based compensation expense.\nInvestor Rights Agreement\nOn October 4, 2019, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement with Citizens Bank, N.A., for a $10.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Company's option, either (1) the arithmetic average of the LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period (one, three or six months (or 12 months if agreed to by all applicable Lenders)) as selected by the Company relevant to such borrowing plus the applicable margin, or (2) a base rate determined by reference to the greatest of the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, the prime commercial lending rate as determined by the Agent, and the daily LIBOR rate plus 1.00%, in each case plus an applicable margin and subject to a floor of 0.00%. In addition, on a quarterly basis, the Company is required to pay each lender under the Revolving Credit Facility a 0.2% commitment fee on the undrawn balance under the Revolving Credit Facility, which may be subject to adjustment based on the Company's total leverage ratio.\n2019 Revolving Credit Facility\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased $9.3 million to $112.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018. The 2019 decrease was primarily due to a net reduction in professional services and outside consulting fees incurred and lower telecommunication and facility costs offset by a right of use asset impairment.\nMost of the Company's contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations which generally include either 1) a perpetual software license with support and maintenance and sometimes a hosting agreement or 2) a term SaaS agreement, in many cases these are sold along with professional services. For these contracts, the Company accounts for individual goods and services separately if they are distinct performance obligations. This often requires significant judgment based upon knowledge of the products, the solution provided and the structure of the sales contract. In SaaS agreements, the Company provides a service to the customer which combines the software functionality, maintenance and hosting into a single performance obligation when the customer doesn't have the ability to take possession of the underlying software license. The Company may also sell the same three goods and services in a contract, but there may be three performance obligations, where the customer has the right to take possession of the software license without significant penalty.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company drew the $10.0 million from our Revolving Credit Facility, which remains outstanding as of December 31, 2020.\nAt December 31, 2020, our non-U.S. subsidiaries held approximately $6.2 million of cash and cash equivalents that are available for use by all of our operations around the world. At this time, we believe the funds held by all non-U.S. subsidiaries will be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. However, if these funds were repatriated to the U.S. or used for U.S. operations, certain amounts could be subject to U.S. tax for the incremental amount in excess of the foreign tax paid. Due to the timing and circumstances of repatriation of these earnings, if any, it is not practical to determine the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the amount.\nTo support our growth, which we expect to be driven by these favorable industry trends mentioned above, we will leverage modular components from our existing software platforms to build new products. We believe that these opportunities will continue to provide future benefits and position us for future revenue growth. We are also making investments in research and development of new products designed to enable us to grow rapidly in the mobile wireless market. Our purchase of capital assets and equipment may also increase based on aggressive deployment, subscriber growth and promotional offers for free or bundled storage by our major Tier 1 carrier customers.\nThe holders of a majority of the Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class, are entitled at each of our annual meetings of stockholders or at any special meeting called for the purpose of electing directors (or by written consent signed by the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock in lieu of such a meeting): (i) to nominate and elect two members of our Board of Directors for so long as the Preferred Percentage (as defined in the Series A Certificate) is equal to or greater than 10%; and (ii) to nominate and elect one member of our Board of Directors for so long as the Preferred Percentage is equal to or greater than 5% but less than 10%.\nTransaction service arrangements include services such as processing equipment orders, new account setup and activation, number port requests, credit checks and inventory management. Transaction revenues are principally based on a contractual price per transaction and are recognized based on the number of transactions processed during each reporting period. Revenues are recorded based on the total number of transactions processed at the applicable price established in the relevant contract.\nThe judgments that we make in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact net income in periods following a business combination. We generally use either the income, cost or market approach to aid in our conclusions of such fair values and asset lives. The income approach presumes that the value of an asset can be estimated by the net economic benefit to be received over the life of the\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, credit facility, and our ability to manage working capital and expected positive cash flows generated from operations in combination with continued expense reductions will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months from the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, as the impact of\nVerizon accounted for more than 10% of the Company's revenues in 2020, 2019, and 2018. The loss of Verizon as a customer would have a material negative impact on our company. However, we believe that the costs incurred and subscriber disruption by Verizon to replace Synchronoss' solutions would be substantial.\n\n\u2022a $45.6 million decrease in Digital Transformation revenues is primarily driven by changes to the STIN business that led the Company to conclude that its collection of certain STIN receivables is no longer probable. In accordance with ASC 842, the portion of revenue that is no longer deemed collectible is reversed in the current period against revenue. Accordingly, the Company determined a contingency reserve is required, which was included as a reduction of revenue. The year over year change to STIN revenue was in excess of $34.6 million. The remaining change is primarily driven by a decline in business activity.\nmultiples based on market data. We generally applied an equal weighting to the income and market approaches for our analysis when both are applied.\nWe generate most of our revenues on a per transaction or subscription basis, which is derived from contracts that extend up to 60 months from execution.\nWe record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. Each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to net change in contingent consideration obligation within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation can result from updates in the achievement of financial or other operational targets and changes to the weighted probability of achieving those future targets. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, any change in the assumptions described above, could have a material impact on the amount of the net change in contingent consideration obligation that we record in any given period.\nSince we conduct operations on a global basis, our effective tax rate has and will depend upon the geographic distribution of our pre-tax earnings among locations with varying tax rates. We account for the effects of income taxes that result from our activities during the current and preceding years. Under this method, deferred income tax liabilities and assets are based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse or be utilized. The realization of deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income. A valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not\u201d that a portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nCost of revenues decreased $28.6 million to $121.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. The 2020 decrease was primarily attributable to the year over year reduction in revenue and the cost savings from strategic initiatives implemented in the year driven mainly by data center consolidation and operating expense savings.\nCash flows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $14.3 million of cash used by investing activities, as compared to $19.4 million in cash provided by investing activities during the same period in 2019. The cash used for investing in the current year was primarily related to the $16.7 million investment in capitalized software offset by the sale of certain IP address assets. The net decrease in cash from investing activities from the prior year mainly related to the net proceeds from the purchases and sales of marketable securities in the prior year that were not present in the current period.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax-planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.\nWe use the average of our fair values for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the quantitative impairment test. The table below depicts the methods employed, assumptions used and percentage fair value in excess of carrying value.\nFor a discussion of recently issued accounting standards see Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAs the crisis continues, we may revise our approach to these initiatives or take additional actions to meet the needs of our employees, customers and the Company and to continue to provide our products and services.\nThe Company paid off the remaining carrying amount of the convertible senior notes on August 15, 2019. For further details, see Note 12. Debt of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nCompanies in the TMT market all face the dilemma of attempting to pivot their businesses to digital execution in order to create experiences that meet the expectations of their subscribers, generate new revenues and streamline costs creating healthier margins at a faster time to market than they have ever operated before. Their challenges feature the lack of skill sets to conceptualize and run day to day digital operations and the lack of resources to integrate their legacy back end systems to enact digital experiences that achieve their business objectives. The growth of Synchronoss Digital Platforms will be driven by the ability to provide TMT companies' desire to obtain digital transformation solutions as quickly as possible while educating them on the ability to operate a digital business efficiently. Our Platform as a Service ( PaaS\u201d) model provides a desirable alternative to heavy capital expenditure spending options often tried internally. The ability for our platforms to create low/no code, new customer digital journeys, virtually on the fly, gives TMT Companies the ability to operate new experiences and businesses without heavily investing in development resources.\nCost of revenues decreased $8.4 million to $150.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018. The 2019 decrease was primarily due to cost savings initiatives implemented in 2018 and continuing into 2019. These initiatives resulted in a decrease in cost of revenues driven mainly by data center consolidation and operating expense savings.\n\u2022a $2.3 million increase in Digital revenues is primarily driven an uptick in subscription services partially offset by a reduction in professional service business.\n\u2022an $18.8 million decrease in Messaging revenues was primarily driven by a significant 2019 non-recurring license and professional services revenue deal in advanced messaging. This revenue change was partially offset by favorable license renewals in 2020.\nthe COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and our operations evolves, we will continue to assess our liquidity needs. Given the economic uncertainty as a result of the pandemic, we have taken actions to improve our current liquidity position, including, reducing working capital, reducing operating costs and substantially reducing discretionary spending. Even with these actions however, an extended period of economic disruption as a result of COVID-19 could materially affect our business, results of operations, ability to meet debt covenants, access to sources of liquidity and financial condition. Our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" section of this MD&A and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d, some of which are outside of our control.\nRestructuring charges were $8.0 million, $0.8 million and $12.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively. The 2020 restructuring costs was primarily driven by our strategic cost savings initiatives to streamline our business operations and reduce headcount. 2019 restructuring costs were primarily related to employment termination costs as a result of the work-force reduction and facility consolidation plans. In prior years, we commenced separate plans designed to reduce operating costs and align our resources with our key strategic priorities, which resulted in work-force reductions and facility consolidations.\nEach holder of Series A Preferred Stock has one vote per share on any matter on which holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote separately as a class, whether at a meeting or by written consent. The holders of Series A Preferred Stock are permitted to take any action or consent to any action with respect to such rights without a meeting by delivering a consent in writing or electronic transmission of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock entitled to cast not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize, take or consent to such action at a meeting of stockholders. In addition to any vote (or action taken by written consent) of the holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock as a separate class provided for in the Series A Certificate or by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote with the holders of shares of common stock (and any other class or series that may similarly be entitled to vote on an as-converted basis with the holders of common stock) on all matters submitted to a vote or to the consent of the stockholders of the Company (including the election of directors) as one class.\nThe 2020 fair value of the reporting unit was estimated using a combination of the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method, and the market approach, which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue\nIncome Taxes\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired, including other definite-lived intangible assets. Our policy is to perform an impairment test of goodwill at least annually, and more frequently if events or circumstances occurred that would indicate a reduced fair value in our reporting units could exist. Typically, we perform a qualitative assessment in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. As part of this qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative assessment where necessary in substantiating our qualitative assessment.\nOn and after the fifth anniversary of February 15, 2018, holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to cause the Company to redeem each share of Series A Preferred Stock for cash in an amount equal to the sum of the current\nFactors influencing the revenue growth rates include the nature of the services the reporting unit provides for its clients, the maturity of the reporting unit and any known concentrated customer contract renewals. We believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable, but they are susceptible to change from period to period. Actual results of operations, cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation, and it is possible that differences and changes could be material.\nOur primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. The primary uses of cash are personnel and related costs, telecommunications and facility costs related primarily to our cost of revenue and general operating expenses including professional service fees, consulting fees, building and equipment maintenance and marketing expense.\nUnder the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, Silver will be entitled to (i) three demand registrations, with no more than two demand registrations in any single calendar year and provided that each demand registration must include at least 10% of the shares of Common Stock held by Silver, including shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and (ii) unlimited piggyback registration rights with respect to primary issuances and all other issuances.\n\n\u2022an increase in Messaging revenues of $28.4 million primarily due to a growth in advanced messaging in North America as well as the continued delivery of an advanced messaging solution to a customer in the Japanese market.\nSignificant accounting policies that we employ are presented in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. There were no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in our Form 10-K during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNet revenues decreased $17.1 million to $291.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. The overall change is due to:\n_______________________________\nWe recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. The amount of the accrual for which an exposure exists is measured by determining the amount that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon the settlement of the position. Components of the reserve are classified as current or a long-term liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on when we expect each of the items to be settled. We record interest and penalties accrued in relation to uncertain tax benefits as a component of interest expense.\n\u2022Enhancing our safety protocols including moving the majority of our employees to remote work arrangements\nA review of long-lived assets for impairment is performed when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. If an indication of impairment is present, the Company compares the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the asset to the asset's carrying amount. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, the Company records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its fair value. The fair value is determined based on valuation techniques such as a comparison to fair values of similar assets or using a discounted cash flow analysis.\nWe believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations and they require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain.\nMany of the Company's contracts guarantee minimum volume transactions from the customer. In these instances, if the customer's total estimated transaction volume for the period is expected to be less than the contractual amount, the Company records revenues at the minimum guaranteed amount on a straight line based over the period covered by the minimum. Setup fees for transactional service arrangements are deferred until set up activities are completed and recognized on a straight-line basis over remaining expected customer relationship period. Revenues are presented net of discounts, which are volume level driven.\nCash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $121.3 million use of cash, as compared to $35.9 million of cash used by financing activities for the same period in 2018. The cash used for financing activities was mainly attributable to the repayment of the convertible debt in August 2019.\nThe rights, preferences, privileges, qualifications, restrictions and limitations of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are set forth in the Series A Certificate. Under the Series A Certificate, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive Preferred Dividends. The Preferred Dividends are due on each Series A Dividend Payment Date. We may choose to pay the Preferred Dividends in cash or in additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock. In the event we do not declare and pay a dividend in-kind or in cash on any Series A Dividend Payment Date, the unpaid amount of the Preferred Dividend will be added to the Liquidation Preference. In addition, the Series A Preferred Stock participates in dividends declared and paid on shares of our common stock.\nIn accordance with Topic 606 Section 10-50-20, any credits due to customers, which are generally performance driven and based upon system availability or response times to incidents, are determined and accounted for in the period in which the services are provided. The Company recognizes revenues from support and maintenance performance obligations over the service delivery period.\nSoftware development costs are accounted for in accordance with either ASC 985-20, Software - Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or Marketed,\u201d or ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software.\u201d Costs associated with the planning and designing phase of software development are classified as research and development costs and are expensed as incurred. The amounts capitalized include external direct costs of services used in developing internal-use software, employee compensation and related expenses of personnel directly associated with the development activities. Once technological feasibility has been determined, a portion of the costs incurred in development, including coding, testing and quality assurance, are capitalized until available for general release to clients.\nThe impact of COVID-19 will depend significantly on the duration and potential cyclicality of the health crisis and the related public policy actions, additional initiatives we undertake in response to employee, market or regulatory needs or demands, the length and severity of the global economic slowdown, and whether and how our customers change their behaviors over the longer term. As a result, the demand for our products and services, as well as our overall results of operations, may be materially and adversely impacted by the pandemic for the duration of 2021 or longer, and we are unable to predict the duration or degree of such impact with any certainty.\nContractual Obligations\nThese restrictions and our responses to them are impacting our customers and their use of our products and services. In addition, governments have imposed a wide variety of consumer protection measures that limit how certain businesses, including TMT companies, can operate their businesses and interact with their customers. The crisis and governmental responses to the crisis have also resulted in a slowdown of global economic activity, which has impacted our customers. As a result, prior trends in our business may not be applicable to our operations during the pendency of the crisis.\nFor the market approach, we used judgment in identifying the relevant comparable-company market multiples. These estimates and assumptions may vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that unit. If sufficient comparable data is not present, the market approach will not be employed. The discount rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations. Our cash and cash equivalents balance was $33.7 million at December 31, 2020. We anticipate that our principal uses of cash and cash equivalents will be to fund our business, including technology expansion and working capital.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nCash flows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $19.4 million of cash provided by investing activities, as compared to $67.3 million in cash used for investing activities during the same period in 2018. The 2019 cash provided from investing activities was driven by the sale of marketable securities offset by our continued investment in capitalized software. The increased spend in 2018 was due primarily to purchase marketable securities and fund the Honeybee acquisition.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $40.6 million to $77.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018. The 2019 decrease was primarily attributable to the expiration of amortizable acquired assets, a reduction in capital expenditures, and the one-time Zentry, LLC ( Zentry\u201d) impairment charge in 2018. These changes were partially offset by the increased amortization of capitalized software.\nFor our performance restricted stock awards and units, we estimate the number of shares the recipient is to receive by applying a probability of achieving the performance goals. The actual number of shares the recipient receives is determined at the end of the performance period based on the results achieved versus goals based on our performance targets, such as revenue, EBITDA and Total Shareholder Return (TSR). Once the number of awards is determined, the compensation cost is fixed and continues to be recognized using straight line recognition over the requisite service period for each vesting tranche.\nA deterioration in profitability, adverse market conditions, significant client losses, changes in spending levels of our existing clients or a different economic outlook than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge in the future.\nofferings. We are also exploring additional opportunities through merger and acquisition activities to support our customer, product and geographic diversification strategies.\nDiscussion of Cash Flows\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\u2022Working with our customers to continue to provide our products and services through the pandemic\nShares of Preferred Stock\nConvertible Senior Notes\nFor so long as the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to nominate at least one director, we are required to obtain the prior approval of Silver prior to taking certain actions, including: (i) certain dividends, repayments and redemptions; (ii) any amendment to our certificate of incorporation that adversely effects the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock; (iii) issuances of stock ranking senior or equivalent to shares of Series A Preferred Stock (including additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock) in the priority of payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of us; (iv) changes in the size of our Board of Directors; (v) any amendment, alteration, modification or repeal of the charter of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors and related documents; and (vi) any change in our principal business or the entry into any line of business outside of our existing lines of businesses. In addition, in the event that we are in EBITDA Non-Compliance (as defined in the Series A Certificate) or the undertaking of certain actions would result in us exceeding a specified pro forma leverage ratio, then the prior approval of Silver would be required to incur indebtedness (or alter any debt document) in excess of $10.0 million, enter or consummate any transaction where the fair market value exceeds $5.0 million individually or $10.0 million in the aggregate in a fiscal year or authorize or commit to capital expenditures in excess of $25.0 million in a fiscal year.\n\nasset, discounted to present value. The cost approach presumes that an investor would pay no more for an asset than its replacement or reproduction cost. The market approach estimates value based on what other participants in the market have paid for reasonably similar assets. Although each valuation approach is considered in valuing the assets acquired, the approach ultimately selected is based on the characteristics of the asset and the availability of information.\nCurrent Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLong lived assets that do not have indefinite lives are amortized/depreciated over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company reevaluates the useful life determinations each year to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining useful lives.\nConcurrently with the closing of the Preferred Transaction, Synchronoss and Silver entered into an Investor Rights Agreement. Under the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, Silver and Synchronoss have agreed that, effective as of the closing of the Preferred Transaction, the Board of Directors of Synchronoss will consist of ten members. From and after the closing of the Preferred Transaction, so long as the holders of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to nominate a member to the Board of Directors pursuant to the Series A Certificate, the Board of Directors of Synchronoss will consist of (i) two directors nominated and elected by the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock; (ii) four directors who meet the independence criteria set forth in the applicable listing standards (each of whom will be initially agreed upon by Synchronoss and Silver); and (iii) four other directors, two of whom shall satisfy the independence criteria of the applicable listing standards and, as of the closing of the Preferred Transaction, one of whom shall be the individual then serving as chief executive officer of Synchronoss and one of whom shall be the current chairman of the Board of Directors of Synchronoss as of the date of execution of the Investors Rights Agreement. Following the closing of the Preferred Transaction, so long as the holders of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to nominate at least one director to the Board of Directors of Synchronoss pursuant to the Series A Certificate, Silver will have the right to designate two members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors.\nThe transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. The Company estimates standalone selling prices of software based on observable inputs of past transactions to similarly situated customers. When such observable data is not available for certain software licenses because there is a limited number of transactions or prices are highly variable, the Company will estimate the standalone selling price using the residual approach. Standalone selling prices of services are typically determined based on observable transactions when these services are sold on a standalone basis to similarly situated customers or estimated using a cost-plus margin approach.\n\u2022a $0.1 million increase in Cloud revenues due to a decrease in transaction revenue of $3.4 million offset by an increase in subscription revenue of $2.8 million and an increase in professional services revenue of $0.7 million.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn accordance with the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement dated as of October 17, 2017 (the PIPE Purchase Agreement\u201d), with Silver Private Holdings I, LLC, an affiliate of Siris ( Silver\u201d), on February 15, 2018, we issued to Silver 185,000 shares of our newly issued Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, with an initial liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, in exchange for $97.7 million in cash and the transfer from Silver to us of the 5,994,667 shares of our common stock held by Silver (the Preferred Transaction\u201d). In connection with the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock, we (i) filed the Series A Certificate and (ii) entered into an Investor Rights Agreement with Silver setting forth certain registration, governance and preemptive rights of Silver with respect to us (the Investor Rights Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the PIPE Purchase Agreement, at the closing, we paid to Siris $5.0 million as a reimbursement of Silver's costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Preferred Transaction.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur policy has been to leave our cumulative unremitted foreign earnings invested indefinitely outside the United States, and we intend to continue this policy. Although the transition tax in the TCJA has removed U.S. federal taxes on distributions to the U.S. on a go forward basis, the Company continues to assert permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings. Due to the timing and circumstances of repatriation of such earnings, if any, it is not practicable to determine the unrecognized deferred tax liability relating to such amounts.\nEach share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into the number of shares of common stock equal to the Conversion Price\u201d (as that term is defined in the Series A Certificate) multiplied by the then applicable Conversion Rate\u201d (as that term is defined in the Series A Certificate). Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is initially convertible into 55.5556 shares of common stock, representing an initial conversion price\u201d of approximately $18.00 per share of common stock. The Conversion Rate is subject to equitable proportionate adjustment in the event of stock splits, recapitalizations and other events set forth in the Series A Certificate.\n\u2022a $0.5 million decrease in Cloud revenues is primarily due to the extension of a significant commercial arrangement which extended recognition of deferred revenue across the term of the new contract, partially offset by increased subscriber growth and professional services revenue.\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a fiscal period. We have discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this Form 10-K. Although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate, correct and reasonable under the circumstances, actual results may differ from those estimates. If actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates, our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K for certain matters bearing risks on our future results of operations.\nNet revenues decreased $17.1 million to $308.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018. The overall change is due to:\nAs of December 31, 2020, we maintain eight stock-based compensation plans. We utilize the Black-Scholes pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options on the dates of grant. Restricted stock awards are measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. We recognize stock-based compensation over the requisite service period with an offsetting credit to additional paid-in capital.\nCash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was a $0.6 million of cash used by operating activities, as compared to $32.6 million of cash provided by operating activities for the same period in 2019. The decrease of cash used by operating activities of $33.1 million was primarily due to favorable changes in cash earnings of $21.4 million offset by an unfavorable change in working capital of $70.2 million. The main driver of the unfavorable movement in working\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company's software licenses typically provide for a perpetual or term right to use the Company's software. The Company has concluded that in most cases its software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered to the customer. Contracts that include software customization or specified upgrades may result in the combination of the customization services with the software license as one performance obligation. The Company does not have a history of returns, or refunds of is software licenses, however, in limited instances, the Company may constrain consideration to high-risk customers, until collection is resolved.\nWe continue to expand our platforms into the converging TMT, MNO, and Digital spaces to enable connected devices to do more things across multiple networks, brands and communities. Our initiatives with AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, British Telecom, Softbank and other CSPs continue to grow both with regard to our current business as well as our new product\n* Amount represents customer delivery related purchase obligations.\nCash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $10.0 million of cash provided, as compared to $121.3 million of cash used by financing activities for the same period in 2019. The cash provided from investing activities was attributable to the $10.0 million drawdown from our Revolving Credit Facility. The net change in cash provided from financing activities from the prior year is primarily attributable to the cash provided from the Revolving Credit Facility offset by repayments for our Convertible Senior Notes in 2019.\nWe account for business combinations in accordance with the acquisition method. The acquisition method of accounting requires that assets acquired, and liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree (if any), be recorded at their fair values on the date of a business acquisition. Our consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business from the completion date of the transaction.\nAlthough inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and equipment, we do not believe that inflation has had any material effect on our results of operations during 2020, 2019 and 2018. We do not expect the current rate of inflation to have a material impact on our business for the foreseeable future.\nFor our 2020 impairment tests, the Company identified one reporting unit, Core. The Company performed a quantitative impairment assessment, as of October 1, 2020, for the Core reporting unit. The amounts below represent the results of our quantitative assessment.\nCOVID-19 was identified in China in late 2019 and has since spread throughout the world, including throughout the United States (U.S.). COVID-19 has resulted in authorities implementing numerous preventative measures to contain or mitigate the outbreak of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limitations on business activity, quarantines, and shelter-in-place orders.\nResearch and development expense increased $1.5 million to $77.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. The increase in 2020 is primarily related to the costs associated with the impairment of\nThe Company's top five customers accounted for 68.0%, 69.2% and 69.0% of net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Contracts with these customers typically run for three to five years. Of these customers,\nDiscussion of the Consolidated Statements of Operations\nA summary of net cash flows follows (in thousands):\nIf we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. Fair value estimates used in the quantitative impairment test are calculated using a combination of the income and market approaches. The income approach is based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit, while the market approach is based on certain multiples of selected guideline public companies or selected guideline transactions. The approaches incorporate a number of market participant assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, income tax rates and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. If the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.\n\u2022Adjusting business operations to address circumstances created by COVID-19\nImpacts of the Recent Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)\nGoodwill\nThis fair value measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. Significant changes in the underlying assumptions used to value long lived assets could significantly increase or decrease the fair value estimates used for impairment assessments.\nBusiness from our traditional Synchronoss Messaging business (Email) has been driven by a resurgence in the need for white label secure messaging platforms that favor the Mobile Network Operator's ( MNO\u201d) business objectives and are not beholden to the objectives of a sponsoring over-the-top ( OTT\u201d) platform. We believe that messaging drives higher subscriber engagement than any other application in the market today and holds the potential to stimulate new revenue from traditional services and third-party brands. OTT global success has driven MNOs to look at opportunities to preempt and compete with the OTTs which has potential opportunity for Synchronoss' future growth to be driven by the need of TMT companies including (and especially) MNOs to embrace Messaging as a Platform ( MaaP\u201d). MaaP will allow TMT and MNO's to converse with subscribers in an efficient, automated way by streamlining the costs and increasing the effectiveness of self-care, as well as yielding cross-sell upselling of service plans, devices, bundles, etc. The Synchronoss Advanced Messaging Platform provides state of the art RCS-driven features including the ability to support advanced Peer to Peer communications and introduce new revenue streams driven by commerce and advertising via Application-to-Person capabilities.\nCash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $32.6 million of cash provided by operating activities, as compared to $31.4 million of cash used by operating activities for the same period in 2018. The increase of cash provided by operating activities of $64.0 million was primarily due to favorable changes in cash earnings of $16.1 million, a $20.7 million tax refund and a favorable change in working capital of $27.1 million.\nliquidation preference and any accrued dividends. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is also redeemable at the option of the holder upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change\u201d (as that term is defined in the Series A Certificate) at a specified premium ( Liquidation Value\u201d). In addition, the Company is also permitted to redeem all outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock at any time (i) within the first 30 months of the date of issuance for the sum of the then-applicable Liquidation Preference, accrued but unpaid dividends and a make whole amount (known as Redemption Value\u201d) and (ii) following the 30-month anniversary of the date of issuance for the sum of the then-applicable Liquidation Preference and the accrued but unpaid dividends. As of December 31, 2020, the Liquidation Value and Redemption Value of the Preferred Shares was $243.1 million.\nBusiness from our Synchronoss Personal Cloud\u2122 solution has been driven by the growth in mobile devices globally that are becoming content rich. As these devices replace other traditional devices like PCs, the ability to securely back up content from mobile devices, sync it with other devices and share it with family, friends and business associates have become essential needs and subscriber expectations. Such devices include smartphones, connected cars, personal health and wellness devices and connected home devices. The need for the contents of these devices to be stored in a common cloud are also expected to be drivers of our business in the longer term.\nUnrecognized tax positions are $3.3 million at December 31, 2020. We are not able to reasonably estimate when we would make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities, but we do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity. We do not expect that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease over the next twelve months.\nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nThe following table presents an overview of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands).\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop, we are actively monitoring the global situation. The extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our customers and our sales cycles, impact on our business operations, impact on our customer, employee or industry events, and effect on our vendors, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact our business, financial condition or results of operations is uncertain, but may include, without limitation, impacts to our paying user growth as well as disruptions to our business operations as a result of travel restrictions, shutdown of workplaces and potential impacts to our vendors. Additionally, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to U.S. dollars, our reporting currency, as well as changes in interest rates. Volatile market conditions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic have and may continue to negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows, due to a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which may cause our revenues to decline relative to our costs.", "item_7_text": "In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ( CARES Act\u201d) was signed into law. The CARES Act provides numerous tax provisions and other stimulus measures, including temporary changes regarding the prior and future utilization of net operating losses. The CARES Act amends the Net Operating Loss provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, allowing for the carryback of losses arising in tax years 2018, 2019 and 2020, to each of the five taxable years preceding the taxable year of loss.\nEstimating the transaction price of variable consideration including the variable quantity subscription or transaction contracts in a multiple performance obligation arrangement requires significant judgment. The Company generally estimates this variable consideration at the most likely amount to which the Company expects to be entitled and in certain cases based on the expected value. The Company includes estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The Company's estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of the Company's anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. The Company reviews and updates these estimates on a quarterly basis.\nSubscription and Transaction revenues consist of revenues derived from the processing of transactions through the Company's service platforms, providing enterprise portal management services on a subscription basis and maintenance agreements on software licenses. The Company generates revenue from Subscription services from monthly active user fees, software as a service ( SaaS\u201d) fees, hosting and storage fees, and fees for the related maintenance support for those services. In most cases, the subscription or transaction arrangement is a single performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer (i.e., distinct days of service). The Company applies a measure of progress (typically time-based) to any fixed consideration and allocates variable consideration to the distinct periods of service based on usage, under Topic 606 Section 10-25-14(b). When the Company does not allocate variable consideration to distinct periods of service, the total estimated transaction price is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, where the level of service provided to the customer does not vary significantly from one period to another.\nOur contractual obligations consist of contingent consideration, office equipment and colocation services and contractual commitments under third-party hosting, software licenses and maintenance agreements. The following table summarizes our long-term contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands).\nEffect of Inflation\nThe Company generates revenue from the delivery of a range of products, solutions and services for operators, enterprises, OEMs and technology providers. We offer services principally on a Transactional or Subscription basis (SaaS) or in the form of Professional Services or Software Licenses. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to the Company's customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company generates all of its revenue from contracts with customers.\nStock-Based Compensation\nAmortization is calculated on a solution-by-solution basis and is recognized over the estimated economic life of the software, typically ranging two to three years. Amortization begins when the software is substantially completed for its intended use. Costs incurred during the preliminary and post-implementation stages are expensed as incurred. The amounts capitalized include external direct costs of services used in developing internal-use software, employee compensation and related expenses of personnel directly associated with the development activities. Software development costs are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Unrecoverable costs are reviewed annually and recognized in the period they become unrecoverable, as needed, and are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as depreciation and amortization expense.\nRevenues\nUse of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical information of our stock. The average expected life was determined using historical stock option exercise activity. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common equity and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\nCertificate of Designation of the Series A Preferred Stock\nUncertain Tax Positions\nUnder the Series A Certificate, if Silver and certain of its affiliates have elected to effect a conversion of some or all of their shares of Series A Preferred Stock and if the sum, without duplication, of (i) the aggregate number of shares of our common stock issued to such holders upon such conversion and any shares of our common stock previously issued to such holders upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock and then held by such holders, plus (ii) the number of shares of our common stock underlying shares of Series A Preferred Stock that would be held at such time by such holders (after giving effect to such conversion), would exceed the 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of our voting stock on an as converted basis (the Conversion Cap\u201d), then such holders would only be entitled to convert such number of shares as would result in the sum of clauses (i) and (ii) (after giving effect to such conversion) being equal to the Conversion Cap (after giving effect to any such limitation on conversion). Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock which a holder has elected to convert but which, by reason of the previous sentence, are not so converted, will be treated as if the holder had not made such election to convert and such shares of Series A Preferred Stock will remain outstanding. Also, under the Series A Certificate, if the sum, without duplication, of (i) the aggregate voting power of the shares previously issued to Silver and certain of its affiliates held by such holders at the record date, plus (ii) the aggregate voting power of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such holders as of such record date, would exceed 19.99% of the total voting power of our outstanding voting stock at such record date, then, with respect to such shares, Silver and certain of its affiliates are only entitled to cast a number of votes equal to 19.99% of such total voting power. The limitation on conversion and voting ceases to apply upon receipt of the requisite approval of holders of our common stock under the applicable listing standards.\nCapitalized Software Development Costs\n\nThe Company's professional services include software development and customization. The contracts generally include project deliverables specified by each customer. The performance obligations in the agreements are generally combined into one deliverable and generally result in the transfer of control over time. The underlying deliverable is owned and controlled by the customer and does not create an asset with an alternative use to us. The Company recognizes revenue on fixed fee contracts on the proportion of labor hours expended to the total hours expected to complete the contract performance obligation.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. The MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn response to COVID-19, we have been executing our business continuity plans and evolving our operations to protect the safety of our employees while continuing to provide critical products and services to our customers. Some of the initiatives the Company has undertaken include:\nDuring our qualitative assessment we make significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments, around the financial performance of the Company, changes in our share price, and forecasts of earnings, working capital requirements, and cash flows. We consider each reporting unit's historical results and operating trends as well as any strategic difference from our historical results when determining these assumptions.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe future success of our business depends on the continued growth of Business-to-Business and Business-to-Business-to-Consumer driving customer transactions, and continued expansion of our platforms into the TMT Market globally through Cloud, Messaging and Digital markets. As such, the volume of transactions and our ability to expand our footprint in TMT and globally may result in revenue fluctuations on a quarterly basis.\nThis disclosure discusses the actions the Company has taken in response to the COVID-19 crisis and the impacts that it has had on our business, as well as related known or expected trends.\n* Cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization which are shown separately.\nThe fair value measurement associated with the quantitative goodwill impairment test is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. Significant changes in the underlying assumptions used to value goodwill could significantly increase or decrease the fair value estimates used for impairment assessments.\nFor so long as Silver has the right to appoint a director to the Board of Directors of Synchronoss, without the prior approval by a majority of directors voting who are not appointed by the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, neither Silver nor its affiliates will directly or indirectly purchase or acquire any debt or equity securities of Synchronoss (including equity-linked derivative securities) if such purchase or acquisition would result in Silver's Standstill Percentage (as defined in the Investor Rights Agreement) being in excess of 30%. However, the foregoing standstill restrictions would not prohibit the purchase of shares pursuant to the PIPE Purchase Agreement or the receipt of shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued as Preferred Dividends pursuant to the Series A Certificate, shares of Common Stock received upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock or receipt of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Common Stock or other securities of the Company otherwise paid as dividends or as an increase of the Liquidation Preference (as defined in the Series A Certificate) or distributions thereon. Silver will also have preemptive rights with respect to issuances of securities of Synchronoss in order to maintain its ownership percentage.\nWhile we believe we have identified all reasonably identifiable exposures and that the reserve we have established for identifiable exposures is appropriate under the circumstances, it is possible that additional exposures exist and that exposures may be settled at amounts different than the amounts reserved. It is also possible that changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to either materially increase or reduce the carrying amount of our tax reserves. In general, tax returns for the year 2017 and thereafter are subject to future examination by tax authorities.\nPursuant to the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, neither Silver nor its affiliates may transfer any shares of Series A Preferred Stock subject to certain exceptions (including transfers to affiliates that agree to be bound by the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement).\nIncome tax. The Company recognized approximately $27.1 million in related income tax benefit and $2.2 million in related income tax provision during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The effective tax rate was approximately 72.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of the CARES Act provision allowing for a 5 year carryback of Net Operating Losses arising in 2018, 2019 and 2020. The Company's effective tax rate was approximately (2.1)% for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to pre-tax losses in jurisdictions where full valuation allowances have been recorded and in zero tax rate jurisdictions and permanent differences associated with U.S. Base Erosion and Anti Abuse Tax elections, offset by certain foreign jurisdictions projecting current income tax expense.\nFor the income approach, we used projections, which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions. Factors specific to each reporting unit include revenue and cost growth, profit margins, terminal value growth rates, capital expenditures projections, assumed tax rates, discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted TCJA. The TCJA made changes to the corporate tax rate, business-related deductions and taxation of foreign earnings, among others, that are generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $33.4 million to $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. The 2020 decrease was primarily attributable to the expiration of amortizable acquired assets and a reduction in capital expenditures. These changes were partially offset by the increased amortization of capitalized software.\nMost of our revenues are recorded in U.S. dollars but as we continue to expand our footprint with international carriers, we will become subject to currency translation that could affect our future net sales as reported in U.S. dollars.\nthe right of use assets. Excluding the impairment charges incurred in 2020, the research and development costs decreased year over year mainly as a result of executed cost savings initiatives to streamline our workforce and reduce vendor spend.\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased $23.5 million to $89.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. The 2020 decrease was primarily attributable to significant cost cutting initiatives executed in year which included headcount reductions, reduced vendor spending and lower facility costs offset by impairments to our right of use assets.\ncapital was the continued run-off of the deferred revenue balance which is in line with our business as our customers shift away from larger prepayments of services.\n________________________________\n\u2022Maintaining effective governance and internal controls in a remote work environment\nResearch and development expense decreased $3.6 million to $75.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018. The decrease in 2019 is primarily due to the realization of our strategic efforts to reduce costs and refocus our resources on key strategic priorities. These efforts resulted in decreased personnel related costs including stock-based compensation expense.\nInvestor Rights Agreement\nOn October 4, 2019, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement with Citizens Bank, N.A., for a $10.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Company's option, either (1) the arithmetic average of the LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period (one, three or six months (or 12 months if agreed to by all applicable Lenders)) as selected by the Company relevant to such borrowing plus the applicable margin, or (2) a base rate determined by reference to the greatest of the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, the prime commercial lending rate as determined by the Agent, and the daily LIBOR rate plus 1.00%, in each case plus an applicable margin and subject to a floor of 0.00%. In addition, on a quarterly basis, the Company is required to pay each lender under the Revolving Credit Facility a 0.2% commitment fee on the undrawn balance under the Revolving Credit Facility, which may be subject to adjustment based on the Company's total leverage ratio.\n2019 Revolving Credit Facility\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased $9.3 million to $112.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018. The 2019 decrease was primarily due to a net reduction in professional services and outside consulting fees incurred and lower telecommunication and facility costs offset by a right of use asset impairment.\nMost of the Company's contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations which generally include either 1) a perpetual software license with support and maintenance and sometimes a hosting agreement or 2) a term SaaS agreement, in many cases these are sold along with professional services. For these contracts, the Company accounts for individual goods and services separately if they are distinct performance obligations. This often requires significant judgment based upon knowledge of the products, the solution provided and the structure of the sales contract. In SaaS agreements, the Company provides a service to the customer which combines the software functionality, maintenance and hosting into a single performance obligation when the customer doesn't have the ability to take possession of the underlying software license. The Company may also sell the same three goods and services in a contract, but there may be three performance obligations, where the customer has the right to take possession of the software license without significant penalty.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company drew the $10.0 million from our Revolving Credit Facility, which remains outstanding as of December 31, 2020.\nAt December 31, 2020, our non-U.S. subsidiaries held approximately $6.2 million of cash and cash equivalents that are available for use by all of our operations around the world. At this time, we believe the funds held by all non-U.S. subsidiaries will be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. However, if these funds were repatriated to the U.S. or used for U.S. operations, certain amounts could be subject to U.S. tax for the incremental amount in excess of the foreign tax paid. Due to the timing and circumstances of repatriation of these earnings, if any, it is not practical to determine the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the amount.\nTo support our growth, which we expect to be driven by these favorable industry trends mentioned above, we will leverage modular components from our existing software platforms to build new products. We believe that these opportunities will continue to provide future benefits and position us for future revenue growth. We are also making investments in research and development of new products designed to enable us to grow rapidly in the mobile wireless market. Our purchase of capital assets and equipment may also increase based on aggressive deployment, subscriber growth and promotional offers for free or bundled storage by our major Tier 1 carrier customers.\nThe holders of a majority of the Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class, are entitled at each of our annual meetings of stockholders or at any special meeting called for the purpose of electing directors (or by written consent signed by the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock in lieu of such a meeting): (i) to nominate and elect two members of our Board of Directors for so long as the Preferred Percentage (as defined in the Series A Certificate) is equal to or greater than 10%; and (ii) to nominate and elect one member of our Board of Directors for so long as the Preferred Percentage is equal to or greater than 5% but less than 10%.\nTransaction service arrangements include services such as processing equipment orders, new account setup and activation, number port requests, credit checks and inventory management. Transaction revenues are principally based on a contractual price per transaction and are recognized based on the number of transactions processed during each reporting period. Revenues are recorded based on the total number of transactions processed at the applicable price established in the relevant contract.\nThe judgments that we make in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact net income in periods following a business combination. We generally use either the income, cost or market approach to aid in our conclusions of such fair values and asset lives. The income approach presumes that the value of an asset can be estimated by the net economic benefit to be received over the life of the\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, credit facility, and our ability to manage working capital and expected positive cash flows generated from operations in combination with continued expense reductions will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months from the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, as the impact of\nVerizon accounted for more than 10% of the Company's revenues in 2020, 2019, and 2018. The loss of Verizon as a customer would have a material negative impact on our company. However, we believe that the costs incurred and subscriber disruption by Verizon to replace Synchronoss' solutions would be substantial.\n\n\u2022a $45.6 million decrease in Digital Transformation revenues is primarily driven by changes to the STIN business that led the Company to conclude that its collection of certain STIN receivables is no longer probable. In accordance with ASC 842, the portion of revenue that is no longer deemed collectible is reversed in the current period against revenue. Accordingly, the Company determined a contingency reserve is required, which was included as a reduction of revenue. The year over year change to STIN revenue was in excess of $34.6 million. The remaining change is primarily driven by a decline in business activity.\nmultiples based on market data. We generally applied an equal weighting to the income and market approaches for our analysis when both are applied.\nWe generate most of our revenues on a per transaction or subscription basis, which is derived from contracts that extend up to 60 months from execution.\nWe record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. Each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to net change in contingent consideration obligation within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation can result from updates in the achievement of financial or other operational targets and changes to the weighted probability of achieving those future targets. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, any change in the assumptions described above, could have a material impact on the amount of the net change in contingent consideration obligation that we record in any given period.\nSince we conduct operations on a global basis, our effective tax rate has and will depend upon the geographic distribution of our pre-tax earnings among locations with varying tax rates. We account for the effects of income taxes that result from our activities during the current and preceding years. Under this method, deferred income tax liabilities and assets are based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse or be utilized. The realization of deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income. A valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not\u201d that a portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nCost of revenues decreased $28.6 million to $121.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. The 2020 decrease was primarily attributable to the year over year reduction in revenue and the cost savings from strategic initiatives implemented in the year driven mainly by data center consolidation and operating expense savings.\nCash flows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $14.3 million of cash used by investing activities, as compared to $19.4 million in cash provided by investing activities during the same period in 2019. The cash used for investing in the current year was primarily related to the $16.7 million investment in capitalized software offset by the sale of certain IP address assets. The net decrease in cash from investing activities from the prior year mainly related to the net proceeds from the purchases and sales of marketable securities in the prior year that were not present in the current period.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax-planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.\nWe use the average of our fair values for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the quantitative impairment test. The table below depicts the methods employed, assumptions used and percentage fair value in excess of carrying value.\nFor a discussion of recently issued accounting standards see Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAs the crisis continues, we may revise our approach to these initiatives or take additional actions to meet the needs of our employees, customers and the Company and to continue to provide our products and services.\nThe Company paid off the remaining carrying amount of the convertible senior notes on August 15, 2019. For further details, see Note 12. Debt of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nCompanies in the TMT market all face the dilemma of attempting to pivot their businesses to digital execution in order to create experiences that meet the expectations of their subscribers, generate new revenues and streamline costs creating healthier margins at a faster time to market than they have ever operated before. Their challenges feature the lack of skill sets to conceptualize and run day to day digital operations and the lack of resources to integrate their legacy back end systems to enact digital experiences that achieve their business objectives. The growth of Synchronoss Digital Platforms will be driven by the ability to provide TMT companies' desire to obtain digital transformation solutions as quickly as possible while educating them on the ability to operate a digital business efficiently. Our Platform as a Service ( PaaS\u201d) model provides a desirable alternative to heavy capital expenditure spending options often tried internally. The ability for our platforms to create low/no code, new customer digital journeys, virtually on the fly, gives TMT Companies the ability to operate new experiences and businesses without heavily investing in development resources.\nCost of revenues decreased $8.4 million to $150.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018. The 2019 decrease was primarily due to cost savings initiatives implemented in 2018 and continuing into 2019. These initiatives resulted in a decrease in cost of revenues driven mainly by data center consolidation and operating expense savings.\n\u2022a $2.3 million increase in Digital revenues is primarily driven an uptick in subscription services partially offset by a reduction in professional service business.\n\u2022an $18.8 million decrease in Messaging revenues was primarily driven by a significant 2019 non-recurring license and professional services revenue deal in advanced messaging. This revenue change was partially offset by favorable license renewals in 2020.\nthe COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and our operations evolves, we will continue to assess our liquidity needs. Given the economic uncertainty as a result of the pandemic, we have taken actions to improve our current liquidity position, including, reducing working capital, reducing operating costs and substantially reducing discretionary spending. Even with these actions however, an extended period of economic disruption as a result of COVID-19 could materially affect our business, results of operations, ability to meet debt covenants, access to sources of liquidity and financial condition. Our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" section of this MD&A and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d, some of which are outside of our control.\nRestructuring charges were $8.0 million, $0.8 million and $12.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively. The 2020 restructuring costs was primarily driven by our strategic cost savings initiatives to streamline our business operations and reduce headcount. 2019 restructuring costs were primarily related to employment termination costs as a result of the work-force reduction and facility consolidation plans. In prior years, we commenced separate plans designed to reduce operating costs and align our resources with our key strategic priorities, which resulted in work-force reductions and facility consolidations.\nEach holder of Series A Preferred Stock has one vote per share on any matter on which holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote separately as a class, whether at a meeting or by written consent. The holders of Series A Preferred Stock are permitted to take any action or consent to any action with respect to such rights without a meeting by delivering a consent in writing or electronic transmission of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock entitled to cast not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize, take or consent to such action at a meeting of stockholders. In addition to any vote (or action taken by written consent) of the holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock as a separate class provided for in the Series A Certificate or by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote with the holders of shares of common stock (and any other class or series that may similarly be entitled to vote on an as-converted basis with the holders of common stock) on all matters submitted to a vote or to the consent of the stockholders of the Company (including the election of directors) as one class.\nThe 2020 fair value of the reporting unit was estimated using a combination of the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method, and the market approach, which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue\nIncome Taxes\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired, including other definite-lived intangible assets. Our policy is to perform an impairment test of goodwill at least annually, and more frequently if events or circumstances occurred that would indicate a reduced fair value in our reporting units could exist. Typically, we perform a qualitative assessment in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. As part of this qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative assessment where necessary in substantiating our qualitative assessment.\nOn and after the fifth anniversary of February 15, 2018, holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to cause the Company to redeem each share of Series A Preferred Stock for cash in an amount equal to the sum of the current\nFactors influencing the revenue growth rates include the nature of the services the reporting unit provides for its clients, the maturity of the reporting unit and any known concentrated customer contract renewals. We believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable, but they are susceptible to change from period to period. Actual results of operations, cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation, and it is possible that differences and changes could be material.\nOur primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. The primary uses of cash are personnel and related costs, telecommunications and facility costs related primarily to our cost of revenue and general operating expenses including professional service fees, consulting fees, building and equipment maintenance and marketing expense.\nUnder the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, Silver will be entitled to (i) three demand registrations, with no more than two demand registrations in any single calendar year and provided that each demand registration must include at least 10% of the shares of Common Stock held by Silver, including shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and (ii) unlimited piggyback registration rights with respect to primary issuances and all other issuances.\n\n\u2022an increase in Messaging revenues of $28.4 million primarily due to a growth in advanced messaging in North America as well as the continued delivery of an advanced messaging solution to a customer in the Japanese market.\nSignificant accounting policies that we employ are presented in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. There were no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in our Form 10-K during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNet revenues decreased $17.1 million to $291.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. The overall change is due to:\n_______________________________\nWe recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. The amount of the accrual for which an exposure exists is measured by determining the amount that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon the settlement of the position. Components of the reserve are classified as current or a long-term liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on when we expect each of the items to be settled. We record interest and penalties accrued in relation to uncertain tax benefits as a component of interest expense.\n\u2022Enhancing our safety protocols including moving the majority of our employees to remote work arrangements\nA review of long-lived assets for impairment is performed when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. If an indication of impairment is present, the Company compares the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the asset to the asset's carrying amount. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, the Company records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its fair value. The fair value is determined based on valuation techniques such as a comparison to fair values of similar assets or using a discounted cash flow analysis.\nWe believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations and they require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain.\nMany of the Company's contracts guarantee minimum volume transactions from the customer. In these instances, if the customer's total estimated transaction volume for the period is expected to be less than the contractual amount, the Company records revenues at the minimum guaranteed amount on a straight line based over the period covered by the minimum. Setup fees for transactional service arrangements are deferred until set up activities are completed and recognized on a straight-line basis over remaining expected customer relationship period. Revenues are presented net of discounts, which are volume level driven.\nCash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $121.3 million use of cash, as compared to $35.9 million of cash used by financing activities for the same period in 2018. The cash used for financing activities was mainly attributable to the repayment of the convertible debt in August 2019.\nThe rights, preferences, privileges, qualifications, restrictions and limitations of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are set forth in the Series A Certificate. Under the Series A Certificate, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive Preferred Dividends. The Preferred Dividends are due on each Series A Dividend Payment Date. We may choose to pay the Preferred Dividends in cash or in additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock. In the event we do not declare and pay a dividend in-kind or in cash on any Series A Dividend Payment Date, the unpaid amount of the Preferred Dividend will be added to the Liquidation Preference. In addition, the Series A Preferred Stock participates in dividends declared and paid on shares of our common stock.\nIn accordance with Topic 606 Section 10-50-20, any credits due to customers, which are generally performance driven and based upon system availability or response times to incidents, are determined and accounted for in the period in which the services are provided. The Company recognizes revenues from support and maintenance performance obligations over the service delivery period.\nSoftware development costs are accounted for in accordance with either ASC 985-20, Software - Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or Marketed,\u201d or ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software.\u201d Costs associated with the planning and designing phase of software development are classified as research and development costs and are expensed as incurred. The amounts capitalized include external direct costs of services used in developing internal-use software, employee compensation and related expenses of personnel directly associated with the development activities. Once technological feasibility has been determined, a portion of the costs incurred in development, including coding, testing and quality assurance, are capitalized until available for general release to clients.\nThe impact of COVID-19 will depend significantly on the duration and potential cyclicality of the health crisis and the related public policy actions, additional initiatives we undertake in response to employee, market or regulatory needs or demands, the length and severity of the global economic slowdown, and whether and how our customers change their behaviors over the longer term. As a result, the demand for our products and services, as well as our overall results of operations, may be materially and adversely impacted by the pandemic for the duration of 2021 or longer, and we are unable to predict the duration or degree of such impact with any certainty.\nContractual Obligations\nThese restrictions and our responses to them are impacting our customers and their use of our products and services. In addition, governments have imposed a wide variety of consumer protection measures that limit how certain businesses, including TMT companies, can operate their businesses and interact with their customers. The crisis and governmental responses to the crisis have also resulted in a slowdown of global economic activity, which has impacted our customers. As a result, prior trends in our business may not be applicable to our operations during the pendency of the crisis.\nFor the market approach, we used judgment in identifying the relevant comparable-company market multiples. These estimates and assumptions may vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that unit. If sufficient comparable data is not present, the market approach will not be employed. The discount rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations. Our cash and cash equivalents balance was $33.7 million at December 31, 2020. We anticipate that our principal uses of cash and cash equivalents will be to fund our business, including technology expansion and working capital.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nCash flows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $19.4 million of cash provided by investing activities, as compared to $67.3 million in cash used for investing activities during the same period in 2018. The 2019 cash provided from investing activities was driven by the sale of marketable securities offset by our continued investment in capitalized software. The increased spend in 2018 was due primarily to purchase marketable securities and fund the Honeybee acquisition.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $40.6 million to $77.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018. The 2019 decrease was primarily attributable to the expiration of amortizable acquired assets, a reduction in capital expenditures, and the one-time Zentry, LLC ( Zentry\u201d) impairment charge in 2018. These changes were partially offset by the increased amortization of capitalized software.\nFor our performance restricted stock awards and units, we estimate the number of shares the recipient is to receive by applying a probability of achieving the performance goals. The actual number of shares the recipient receives is determined at the end of the performance period based on the results achieved versus goals based on our performance targets, such as revenue, EBITDA and Total Shareholder Return (TSR). Once the number of awards is determined, the compensation cost is fixed and continues to be recognized using straight line recognition over the requisite service period for each vesting tranche.\nA deterioration in profitability, adverse market conditions, significant client losses, changes in spending levels of our existing clients or a different economic outlook than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge in the future.\nofferings. We are also exploring additional opportunities through merger and acquisition activities to support our customer, product and geographic diversification strategies.\nDiscussion of Cash Flows\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\u2022Working with our customers to continue to provide our products and services through the pandemic\nShares of Preferred Stock\nConvertible Senior Notes\nFor so long as the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to nominate at least one director, we are required to obtain the prior approval of Silver prior to taking certain actions, including: (i) certain dividends, repayments and redemptions; (ii) any amendment to our certificate of incorporation that adversely effects the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock; (iii) issuances of stock ranking senior or equivalent to shares of Series A Preferred Stock (including additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock) in the priority of payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of us; (iv) changes in the size of our Board of Directors; (v) any amendment, alteration, modification or repeal of the charter of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors and related documents; and (vi) any change in our principal business or the entry into any line of business outside of our existing lines of businesses. In addition, in the event that we are in EBITDA Non-Compliance (as defined in the Series A Certificate) or the undertaking of certain actions would result in us exceeding a specified pro forma leverage ratio, then the prior approval of Silver would be required to incur indebtedness (or alter any debt document) in excess of $10.0 million, enter or consummate any transaction where the fair market value exceeds $5.0 million individually or $10.0 million in the aggregate in a fiscal year or authorize or commit to capital expenditures in excess of $25.0 million in a fiscal year.\n\nasset, discounted to present value. The cost approach presumes that an investor would pay no more for an asset than its replacement or reproduction cost. The market approach estimates value based on what other participants in the market have paid for reasonably similar assets. Although each valuation approach is considered in valuing the assets acquired, the approach ultimately selected is based on the characteristics of the asset and the availability of information.\nCurrent Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLong lived assets that do not have indefinite lives are amortized/depreciated over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company reevaluates the useful life determinations each year to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining useful lives.\nConcurrently with the closing of the Preferred Transaction, Synchronoss and Silver entered into an Investor Rights Agreement. Under the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, Silver and Synchronoss have agreed that, effective as of the closing of the Preferred Transaction, the Board of Directors of Synchronoss will consist of ten members. From and after the closing of the Preferred Transaction, so long as the holders of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to nominate a member to the Board of Directors pursuant to the Series A Certificate, the Board of Directors of Synchronoss will consist of (i) two directors nominated and elected by the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock; (ii) four directors who meet the independence criteria set forth in the applicable listing standards (each of whom will be initially agreed upon by Synchronoss and Silver); and (iii) four other directors, two of whom shall satisfy the independence criteria of the applicable listing standards and, as of the closing of the Preferred Transaction, one of whom shall be the individual then serving as chief executive officer of Synchronoss and one of whom shall be the current chairman of the Board of Directors of Synchronoss as of the date of execution of the Investors Rights Agreement. Following the closing of the Preferred Transaction, so long as the holders of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to nominate at least one director to the Board of Directors of Synchronoss pursuant to the Series A Certificate, Silver will have the right to designate two members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors.\nThe transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. The Company estimates standalone selling prices of software based on observable inputs of past transactions to similarly situated customers. When such observable data is not available for certain software licenses because there is a limited number of transactions or prices are highly variable, the Company will estimate the standalone selling price using the residual approach. Standalone selling prices of services are typically determined based on observable transactions when these services are sold on a standalone basis to similarly situated customers or estimated using a cost-plus margin approach.\n\u2022a $0.1 million increase in Cloud revenues due to a decrease in transaction revenue of $3.4 million offset by an increase in subscription revenue of $2.8 million and an increase in professional services revenue of $0.7 million.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn accordance with the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement dated as of October 17, 2017 (the PIPE Purchase Agreement\u201d), with Silver Private Holdings I, LLC, an affiliate of Siris ( Silver\u201d), on February 15, 2018, we issued to Silver 185,000 shares of our newly issued Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, with an initial liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, in exchange for $97.7 million in cash and the transfer from Silver to us of the 5,994,667 shares of our common stock held by Silver (the Preferred Transaction\u201d). In connection with the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock, we (i) filed the Series A Certificate and (ii) entered into an Investor Rights Agreement with Silver setting forth certain registration, governance and preemptive rights of Silver with respect to us (the Investor Rights Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the PIPE Purchase Agreement, at the closing, we paid to Siris $5.0 million as a reimbursement of Silver's costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Preferred Transaction.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur policy has been to leave our cumulative unremitted foreign earnings invested indefinitely outside the United States, and we intend to continue this policy. Although the transition tax in the TCJA has removed U.S. federal taxes on distributions to the U.S. on a go forward basis, the Company continues to assert permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings. Due to the timing and circumstances of repatriation of such earnings, if any, it is not practicable to determine the unrecognized deferred tax liability relating to such amounts.\nEach share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into the number of shares of common stock equal to the Conversion Price\u201d (as that term is defined in the Series A Certificate) multiplied by the then applicable Conversion Rate\u201d (as that term is defined in the Series A Certificate). Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is initially convertible into 55.5556 shares of common stock, representing an initial conversion price\u201d of approximately $18.00 per share of common stock. The Conversion Rate is subject to equitable proportionate adjustment in the event of stock splits, recapitalizations and other events set forth in the Series A Certificate.\n\u2022a $0.5 million decrease in Cloud revenues is primarily due to the extension of a significant commercial arrangement which extended recognition of deferred revenue across the term of the new contract, partially offset by increased subscriber growth and professional services revenue.\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a fiscal period. We have discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this Form 10-K. Although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate, correct and reasonable under the circumstances, actual results may differ from those estimates. If actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates, our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K for certain matters bearing risks on our future results of operations.\nNet revenues decreased $17.1 million to $308.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018. The overall change is due to:\nAs of December 31, 2020, we maintain eight stock-based compensation plans. We utilize the Black-Scholes pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options on the dates of grant. Restricted stock awards are measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. We recognize stock-based compensation over the requisite service period with an offsetting credit to additional paid-in capital.\nCash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was a $0.6 million of cash used by operating activities, as compared to $32.6 million of cash provided by operating activities for the same period in 2019. The decrease of cash used by operating activities of $33.1 million was primarily due to favorable changes in cash earnings of $21.4 million offset by an unfavorable change in working capital of $70.2 million. The main driver of the unfavorable movement in working\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company's software licenses typically provide for a perpetual or term right to use the Company's software. The Company has concluded that in most cases its software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered to the customer. Contracts that include software customization or specified upgrades may result in the combination of the customization services with the software license as one performance obligation. The Company does not have a history of returns, or refunds of is software licenses, however, in limited instances, the Company may constrain consideration to high-risk customers, until collection is resolved.\nWe continue to expand our platforms into the converging TMT, MNO, and Digital spaces to enable connected devices to do more things across multiple networks, brands and communities. Our initiatives with AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, British Telecom, Softbank and other CSPs continue to grow both with regard to our current business as well as our new product\n* Amount represents customer delivery related purchase obligations.\nCash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $10.0 million of cash provided, as compared to $121.3 million of cash used by financing activities for the same period in 2019. The cash provided from investing activities was attributable to the $10.0 million drawdown from our Revolving Credit Facility. The net change in cash provided from financing activities from the prior year is primarily attributable to the cash provided from the Revolving Credit Facility offset by repayments for our Convertible Senior Notes in 2019.\nWe account for business combinations in accordance with the acquisition method. The acquisition method of accounting requires that assets acquired, and liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree (if any), be recorded at their fair values on the date of a business acquisition. Our consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business from the completion date of the transaction.\nAlthough inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and equipment, we do not believe that inflation has had any material effect on our results of operations during 2020, 2019 and 2018. We do not expect the current rate of inflation to have a material impact on our business for the foreseeable future.\nFor our 2020 impairment tests, the Company identified one reporting unit, Core. The Company performed a quantitative impairment assessment, as of October 1, 2020, for the Core reporting unit. The amounts below represent the results of our quantitative assessment.\nCOVID-19 was identified in China in late 2019 and has since spread throughout the world, including throughout the United States (U.S.). COVID-19 has resulted in authorities implementing numerous preventative measures to contain or mitigate the outbreak of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limitations on business activity, quarantines, and shelter-in-place orders.\nResearch and development expense increased $1.5 million to $77.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. The increase in 2020 is primarily related to the costs associated with the impairment of\nThe Company's top five customers accounted for 68.0%, 69.2% and 69.0% of net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Contracts with these customers typically run for three to five years. Of these customers,\nDiscussion of the Consolidated Statements of Operations\nA summary of net cash flows follows (in thousands):\nIf we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. Fair value estimates used in the quantitative impairment test are calculated using a combination of the income and market approaches. The income approach is based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit, while the market approach is based on certain multiples of selected guideline public companies or selected guideline transactions. The approaches incorporate a number of market participant assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, income tax rates and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. If the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.\n\u2022Adjusting business operations to address circumstances created by COVID-19\nImpacts of the Recent Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)\nGoodwill\nThis fair value measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. Significant changes in the underlying assumptions used to value long lived assets could significantly increase or decrease the fair value estimates used for impairment assessments.\nBusiness from our traditional Synchronoss Messaging business (Email) has been driven by a resurgence in the need for white label secure messaging platforms that favor the Mobile Network Operator's ( MNO\u201d) business objectives and are not beholden to the objectives of a sponsoring over-the-top ( OTT\u201d) platform. We believe that messaging drives higher subscriber engagement than any other application in the market today and holds the potential to stimulate new revenue from traditional services and third-party brands. OTT global success has driven MNOs to look at opportunities to preempt and compete with the OTTs which has potential opportunity for Synchronoss' future growth to be driven by the need of TMT companies including (and especially) MNOs to embrace Messaging as a Platform ( MaaP\u201d). MaaP will allow TMT and MNO's to converse with subscribers in an efficient, automated way by streamlining the costs and increasing the effectiveness of self-care, as well as yielding cross-sell upselling of service plans, devices, bundles, etc. The Synchronoss Advanced Messaging Platform provides state of the art RCS-driven features including the ability to support advanced Peer to Peer communications and introduce new revenue streams driven by commerce and advertising via Application-to-Person capabilities.\nCash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $32.6 million of cash provided by operating activities, as compared to $31.4 million of cash used by operating activities for the same period in 2018. The increase of cash provided by operating activities of $64.0 million was primarily due to favorable changes in cash earnings of $16.1 million, a $20.7 million tax refund and a favorable change in working capital of $27.1 million.\nliquidation preference and any accrued dividends. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is also redeemable at the option of the holder upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change\u201d (as that term is defined in the Series A Certificate) at a specified premium ( Liquidation Value\u201d). In addition, the Company is also permitted to redeem all outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock at any time (i) within the first 30 months of the date of issuance for the sum of the then-applicable Liquidation Preference, accrued but unpaid dividends and a make whole amount (known as Redemption Value\u201d) and (ii) following the 30-month anniversary of the date of issuance for the sum of the then-applicable Liquidation Preference and the accrued but unpaid dividends. As of December 31, 2020, the Liquidation Value and Redemption Value of the Preferred Shares was $243.1 million.\nBusiness from our Synchronoss Personal Cloud\u2122 solution has been driven by the growth in mobile devices globally that are becoming content rich. As these devices replace other traditional devices like PCs, the ability to securely back up content from mobile devices, sync it with other devices and share it with family, friends and business associates have become essential needs and subscriber expectations. Such devices include smartphones, connected cars, personal health and wellness devices and connected home devices. The need for the contents of these devices to be stored in a common cloud are also expected to be drivers of our business in the longer term.\nUnrecognized tax positions are $3.3 million at December 31, 2020. We are not able to reasonably estimate when we would make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities, but we do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity. We do not expect that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease over the next twelve months.\nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nThe following table presents an overview of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands).\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop, we are actively monitoring the global situation. The extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our customers and our sales cycles, impact on our business operations, impact on our customer, employee or industry events, and effect on our vendors, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact our business, financial condition or results of operations is uncertain, but may include, without limitation, impacts to our paying user growth as well as disruptions to our business operations as a result of travel restrictions, shutdown of workplaces and potential impacts to our vendors. Additionally, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to U.S. dollars, our reporting currency, as well as changes in interest rates. Volatile market conditions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic have and may continue to negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows, due to a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which may cause our revenues to decline relative to our costs.", "item_7_tables": "Table 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 vs 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(564) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,583 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(31,369) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(33,147) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63,952 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities </td> <td>(14,339) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,377 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(67,282) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33,716) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86,659 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td>9,991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(121,257) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35,885) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>131,248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(85,372) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>Table 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022-2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>2025-2026 </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance lease obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>258 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>171 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,273 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,367 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,594 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations* </td> <td> </td> <td>58,222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,632 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,891 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,699 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>127,480 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,066 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,594 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>Table 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 Impairment Test </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reporting Unit </td> <td>Discount Rate </td> <td>Growth rate range </td> <td>Terminal Growth Rate </td> <td>Goodwill </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value Exceeds Carrying Value by </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value method </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core </td> <td>13.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td>2.0 -
