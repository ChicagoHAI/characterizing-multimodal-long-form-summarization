MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that are included in this annual report. Capitalized terms used, but not defined, in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations have the same meanings as defined in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nExecutive Overview\nWe are a self-managed, self-administered, fully integrated REIT that is engaged in the ownership, development, acquisition, leasing, management and operation of regional shopping malls, open-air and mixed-use centers, outlet centers, associated centers, community centers and office properties. Our shopping centers are located in 26 states, but are primarily in the southeastern and midwestern United States. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.\nWe conduct substantially all of our business through the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership consolidates the financial statements of all entities in which it has a controlling financial interest or where it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. See Item 1. Business\nfor a description of our Properties owned and under development as of December 31, 2019.\nWe had a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $131.7 million as compared to a net loss of $99.2 million in the prior-year period. The operating results of our Properties declined further in 2019 due to the ongoing challenges in the retail environment that have resulted in tenant bankruptcies, store closures and rental reductions for tenants with high occupancy costs. We recognized non-cash impairment losses of $239.5 million related to six malls and one community center and $61.8 million of expense related to a litigation settlement entered into in 2019, which were partially offset by gain on investments/deconsolidation of $67.2 million related to the sale of a portion of our interests in two joint ventures and a gain on extinguishment of debt of $71.7 million related to two Malls.\nSame-center NOI (see below) decreased 6.5% as compared to the prior-year period. Stabilized mall same-center sales per square foot increased to $386 for the current year from $379 for the prior-year period. Diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") attributable to common shareholders was ($0.89) per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $(0.72) per diluted share for the prior-year period. FFO, as adjusted, per diluted share (see below) decreased 21.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1.36 per diluted share as compared to $1.73 per diluted share in the prior-year period.\nAs our results for 2019 and guidance for 2020 indicate, we are facing ongoing challenges, including heightened bankruptcy and store closure activity from retailers as they struggle to succeed in an increasingly competitive and fast-changing industry. Revenues and occupancy were significantly impacted by retailer bankruptcies, store closings, including the liquidation or reorganization of several major retailers, and rent reductions for tenants with high occupancy costs.\nAverage leasing spreads for comparable space under 10,000 square feet in our stabilized malls were down 8.6% for leases signed in 2019, including a 11.5% decrease in renewal lease rates and a 9.1% increase for new leases. Average annual base rents for our same-center malls also decreased to $31.85 per square foot as of December 31, 2019 compared to $32.64 per square foot for the prior-year period.\nIn 2019 we continued to execute our strategy to transform our properties into suburban town centers, primarily through the re-tenanting of former anchor locations as well as diversification of in-line tenancy. We also significantly extended our debt maturity schedule by replacing our unsecured credit facilities and unsecured term loans with a new $1.185 billion secured facility with 16 banks that closed in January 2019, which provides us the flexibility to execute on our operational and redevelopment goals. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\nsection for more information. While the industry and our Company continue to face challenges, some of which may not be in our control, we believe that the strategies in place to redevelop our Properties and diversify our tenant mix will contribute to stabilization of our portfolio and revenues in future years.\nSame-center NOI and FFO are non-GAAP measures. For a description of same-center NOI, a reconciliation from net income to same-center NOI, and an explanation of why we believe this is a useful performance measure, see Non-GAAP Measure - Same-center Net Operating Income in Results of Operations.\u201d\nFor a description of FFO and FFO, as adjusted, a reconciliation from net income attributable to common shareholders to FFO allocable to Operating\nPartnership common unitholders, and an explanation of why we believe this is a useful performance measure, see Non-GAAP Measure -\nFunds from Operations within the\n\"Liquidity and Capital Resources\"\nsection.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2019\nto the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2018\nProperties that were in operation for the entire year during both 2019 and 2018 are referred to as the 2019 Comparable Properties.\u201d Since January 1, 2018, we have opened two self-storage facilities and one community center as follows:\nTable 249: <table> <tr>

cost levels, including tenants that declared bankruptcy in 2019 and 2018.\nThe decrease in management, development and leasing fees of $1.2 million was primarily due to terminated contracts for properties that we were managing for third-party owners.\nThe increase in other revenues of $3.6 million was primarily due to one-time payments from third parties to waive certain restrictions related to prior transactions.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 252: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total for the Year\nEnded December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Properties decreased primarily due to a change in the classification of bad debt expense as a result of the adoption of ASC 842 effective January 1, 2019. Bad debt expense of $4.8 million was included in property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018; however, beginning January 1, 2019, rental revenues that are estimated to be uncollectable are reflected as a decrease in rental revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $3.5 million as a reduction to rental revenues for amounts that are\nestimated to be uncollectable, substantially all of which was related to the Comparable Properties. The remaining decrease in property operating expenses of the Comparable Properties was primarily due to maintenance and repairs, marketing and payroll expenses. Real estate tax expense declined as a number of the Comparable Properties experienced reductions in real estate taxes in their respective markets.\nThe $15.0 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of the Comparable Properties is primarily due to write-offs of tenant improvements and intangible lease assets related to store closings in the prior year period, as well as a lower basis in depreciable assets resulting from impairments recorded in 2018 and 2019.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $2.7 million primarily due to higher legal expense related to litigation and adopting the new leasing standard in 2019, which resulted in discontinuing capitalizing the cost of leasing personnel for development and redevelopment projects, which were partially offset by reductions in salary and stock compensation costs.\nDuring 2019, we recognized $239.5 million of loss on impairment of real estate to write down the book value of six malls and one community center. During 2018, we recognized $174.5 million of loss on impairment of real estate to write down the book value of five malls and undeveloped land. See Note 16\nto the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these impairments.\nDuring 2019, we recognized $61.8 million of litigation settlement expense related to the settlement of a class action lawsuit. See Note 15\nto the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nOther Income and Expenses\nInterest and other income increased $0.9 million in 2019 compared to the prior-year period primarily due to additional interest income received related to a mortgage note receivable that was retired in the current year.\nInterest expense decreased $13.8 million in 2019 compared to the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily due to a $13.5 million decrease in property-level interest expense, including default interest expense, due to dispositions of encumbered properties during 2019 and a paydown in May 2019 of a portion of the loan that is secured by The Outlet Shoppes at Laredo. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $3.2 million in corporate-level interest expense due to higher variable rates on our corporate-level debt as compared to the prior-year, partially related to the higher interest rate on our new secured credit facility as compared with the previous credit facility, as well as increases in LIBOR.\nDuring 2019, we recorded $71.7 million of gain on extinguishment of debt related to two malls. We transferred Acadiana Mall to the lender in satisfaction of the non-recourse debt secured by the property. We sold Cary Towne Center and used the net proceeds from the sale to satisfy a portion of the non-recourse loan that secured the property. The remaining principal balance was forgiven.\nDuring 2019, we recorded $67.2 million of gain on deconsolidation related to The Outlet Shoppes at El Paso and The Outlet Shoppes at Atlanta. See Note 7\nfor more information.\nThe income tax provision of $3.2 million in 2019 relates to the Management Company, which is a taxable REIT subsidiary, and consists of a current tax provision of $0.5 million and a deferred tax provision of $2.7 million. The income tax benefit of $1.6 million in 2018 consists of a current tax provision of $1.3 million and a deferred tax benefit of $2.9 million.\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased by $9.7 million during 2019 compared to the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense related to the retirement of certain real estate assets and decreases in rental revenues at several malls primarily due to store closures and rent concessions for tenants with high occupancy cost levels, including tenants in bankruptcy.\nIn 2019, we recognized $16.3 million of gain on sales of real estate assets primarily related to the sale of two centers, a hotel, an office building and seven outparcels. In 2018, we recognized a $19.0 million gain on sales of real estate assets, which included $7.5 million for the sale of four operating properties and $11.5 million related to the sale of 12 outparcels.\nSee Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for a comparison of the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNon-GAAP Measure\nSame-center Net Operating Income\nNOI is a supplemental non-GAAP measure of the operating performance of our shopping centers and other Properties. We define NOI as property operating revenues (rental revenues, tenant reimbursements and other income) less property operating expenses (property operating, real estate taxes and maintenance and repairs).\nWe compute NOI based on the Operating Partnership's pro rata share of both consolidated and unconsolidated Properties. We believe that presenting NOI and same-center NOI (described below) based on our Operating Partnership's pro rata share of both consolidated and unconsolidated Properties is useful since we conduct substantially all of our business through our Operating Partnership and, therefore, it reflects the performance of the Properties in absolute terms regardless of the ratio of ownership interests of our common shareholders and the noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership. Our definition of NOI may be different than that used by other companies, and accordingly, our calculation of NOI may not be comparable to that of other companies.\nSince NOI includes only those revenues and expenses related to the operations of our shopping center Properties, we believe that same-center NOI provides a measure that reflects trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, sales at the malls and operating costs and the impact of those trends on our results of operations. Our calculation of same-center NOI excludes lease termination income, straight-line rent adjustments, and amortization of above and below market lease intangibles in order to enhance the comparability of results from one period to another.\nWe include a Property in our same-center pool when we have owned all or a portion of the Property since January 1 of the preceding calendar year and it has been in operation for both the entire preceding calendar year ended December 31, 2018 and the current year ended December 31, 2019. New Properties are excluded from same-center NOI, until they meet these criteria. Properties excluded from the same-center pool, which would otherwise meet these criteria, are Properties that are being repositioned or Properties where we are considering alternatives for repositioning, where we intend to renegotiate the terms of the debt secured by the related Property or return the Property to the lender. Greenbrier Mall and Hickory Point Mall were classified as Lender Malls as of December 31, 2019.\nDue to the exclusions noted above, same-center NOI should only be used as a supplemental measure of our performance and not as an alternative to GAAP operating income (loss) or net income (loss).

The NOI decline of 6.5% for 2019 was driven by a decline in total revenue of $48.8 million offset by a $9.9 million decline in total operating expenses. Rental revenues declined $58.0 million during 2019 primarily due to the impact of store closures and rent concessions for tenants with high occupancy cost levels, including tenants that declared bankruptcy. The decrease in rental revenues includes the impact of $4.8 million of uncollectable revenues, which was formerly categorized as bad debt expense included in property operating expense in the prior-year period. The $9.9 million decrease in total operating expenses was primarily driven by bad debt expense of $5.0 million in the prior-year period and a decrease in real estate tax expense of $4.2 million.\nOperational Review\nThe shopping center business is, to some extent, seasonal in nature with tenants typically achieving the highest levels of sales during the fourth quarter due to the holiday season, which generally results in higher percentage rents in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the malls earn most of their rents from short-term tenants during the holiday period. Thus, occupancy levels and revenue production are generally the highest in the fourth quarter of each year. Results of operations realized in any one quarter may not be indicative of the results likely to be experienced over the course of the fiscal year.\nWe derive the majority of our revenues from the Mall Properties. The sources of our revenues by property type were as follows:\nTable 255: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Malls\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 91.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 91.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMall Store Sales\nMall store sales include reporting mall tenants of 10,000 square feet or less for Stabilized Malls and exclude license agreements, which are retail contracts that are temporary or short-term in nature and generally last more than three months but less than twelve months.

are working to diversify and stabilize revenues. In recent months, we have opened 15 new tenants in former anchor locations, adding more productive, higher traffic-driving uses. Also, we have another dozen committed replacements either under construction or with planning underway. We are proactively reducing our exposure to apparel retailers with more than 76% of 2019 mall leasing completed with non-apparel tenants.\nLiquidity and Ca pital Resources\nIn January 2019, we entered into a new $1.185 billion senior secured credit facility, which included a fully-funded $500 million term loan and a revolving line of credit with a borrowing capacity of $685 million. The facility replaced all of the Company's prior unsecured bank facilities, which included three unsecured term loans with an aggregate balance of $695 million and three unsecured revolving lines of credit with an aggregate capacity of $1.1 billion. At closing, we utilized the line of credit to reduce the principal balance of the unsecured term loans from $695 million to $500 million. The facility matures in July 2023 and bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 2.25%. The Operating Partnership is required to pay an annual facility fee on the line of credit balance, to be paid quarterly, which ranges from 0.25% to 0.35%, based on the unused capacity of the line of credit. The principal balance on the term loan will be reduced by $35 million per year in quarterly installments. The senior secured credit facility is secured by a portfolio of the Company's Properties consisting of seventeen malls and three associated centers. The facility contains customary provisions upon which the Properties may be released from the collateral securing the Facility. The senior secured credit facility contains, among other restrictions, various restrictive covenants that are defined and computed on the same basis as the covenants required under the Notes. Such covenants relate to the Operating Partnership's and the Company's aggregate unsecured debt, aggregate secured debt, maintenance of unencumbered assets and debt service coverage. The Credit Agreement for the senior secured credit facility contains default and cross-default provisions customary for transactions of this nature (with applicable customary grace periods). Any default (i) in the payment of any recourse indebtedness greater than or equal to $50.0 million (for the Company's ownership share), or any non-recourse indebtedness greater than or equal to $150.0 million (for the Company's ownership share) or (ii) that results in the acceleration of the maturity of recourse indebtedness greater than or equal to $50.0 million (for the Company's ownership share), or any non-recourse indebtedness greater than or equal to $150.0 million (for the Company's ownership share) of the Company or the Operating Partnership will constitute an event of default under the Credit Agreement. At all times during the term of the Credit Agreement, there shall be no fewer than ten Borrowing Base Properties (as defined in the Credit Agreement) which have an aggregate occupancy rate of not less than 80% on a quarterly basis. In addition, at all times the Company shall be required to maintain a minimum debt yield of 10% for the Borrowing Base Properties based on the outstanding balance of the facility. The Credit Agreement provides that, upon the occurrence and continuation of an event of default, payment of all amounts outstanding under the facility may be accelerated and the lenders' commitments may be terminated. The Company is a limited guarantor of the Operating Partnership's obligations under the terms of the new Credit Agreement.\nDuring 2019, we reduced our total pro rata share of debt by $409.0 million excluding debt issuance costs. In addition to scheduled amortization, we sold Cary Towne Center and transferred Acadiana Mall to the lender, which resulted in a reduction of $163.5 million. We closed on $185.7 million in gross asset sales, which consisted of $137.1 million related to the sale of properties and outparcels and $48.6 million related to the sale of a portion of our interests in two joint ventures. In conjunction with the sale of our interests in these joint ventures, our partner assumed $30.0 million of related debt. Excess proceeds from the sales were used to retire debt. See Note 6\nand\nNote 7\nfor additional information on dispositions.\nIn 2019, we entered into four unconsolidated construction loans totaling $38.3 million. We refinanced the loan secured by one of our consolidated malls to increase the principal balance to $50.0 million and used the net proceeds from the new loan to retire the existing $41.0 million loan. Also, we exercised an option to extend the loan secured by a consolidated mall to May 2021. In conjunction with the extension, a payment of $10.8 million was made to reduce the outstanding balance of the loan to $43.0 million, of which our joint venture partner funded its 35% share. See\nNote 7\nand\nNote 8\nto the consolidated financial statements for more information on 2019 loan activity.\nIn April 2019, we entered into a settlement agreement and release with respect to a class action lawsuit. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, we did not pay any dividends to holders of our common stock payable in the third and fourth quarters of 2019. Unrelated to the settlement agreement, the board of directors decided to suspend dividends in 2020, subject to quarterly review. See Note 15\nto the consolidated financial statements for more information related to the settlement.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $310.9 million outstanding on our secured line of credit leaving $374.1 million of availability, after considering outstanding letters of credit of $4.8 million, as well as unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $32.8 million. Our total pro rata share of debt at December 31, 2019 was $4.3 billion. Our consolidated unencumbered properties generated approximately 27.4% of total consolidated NOI for the year ended December 31, 2019 (excluding dispositions and Excluded Malls).\nWe derive the majority of our revenues from leases with retail tenants, which have historically been the primary source for funding short-term liquidity and capital needs such as operating expenses, debt service, tenant construction allowances, recurring capital expenditures, dividends and distributions. We believe that the cash flows generated from our operations, combined with our debt and equity sources, including but not limited to, the availability under our secured line\nof credit , the suspension of dividends on our preferred stock and common stock and proceeds from dispositions will, for the foreseeable future, provide adequate liquidity to meet our cash needs. In addition to these factors, subject to market conditions, we have options available to us to generate additional liquidity, including but not limited to, debt and equity offerings, joint venture investments, issuances of noncontrolling interests in our Operating Partnership, and decreasing expenditures related to tenant construction allowances and other capital expenditures. We also generate revenues from sales of peripheral land at our properties and from sales of real estate assets when it is determined that we can realize an optimal value for the assets.\nCash Flows - Operating, Investing and Financing Activities\nThere was $59.1 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of December 31, 2019, an increase of $1.6 million from December 31, 2018. Of this amount, $32.8 million was unrestricted cash as of December 31, 2019. Our net cash flows are summarized as follows (in thousands):\nTable 268: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 273,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 377,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (103,834\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (27,469\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (296,448\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (360,433\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash flows\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10,660\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nTable 269: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\u2022\n</td> <td>\nCash provided by operating activities during 2019 decreased $103.8 million to $273.4 million from $377.2 million during 2018.

The cash inflow for 2019 was primarily related to a greater amount of proceeds from sales in the current year combined with lower cash paid for capital expenditures as we continue to focus on controlling such expenditures. These increases were partially offset by a lower amount of distributions from unconsolidated affiliates in 2019 as we received a distribution from an unconsolidated affiliate in 2018 related to excess proceeds from the refinancing of a mortgage loan.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nTable 271: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\u2022\n</td> <td>\nCash flows used in financing activities during 2019 was $296.4 million as compared to $360.4 million in the prior-year period. The reduction in our common and preferred stock dividend resulted in savings in dividends and distributions paid to common and preferred shareholders and the noncontrolling interest holders in the Operating Partnership. This was partially offset by the additional principal payments on debt and the payment of deferred financing costs, which were mostly related to our new secured credit facility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Item 7.

Either the Operating Partnership or one of its consolidated subsidiaries, that it has a direct or indirect ownership interest in, is the borrower on all of our debt.\nCBL is a limited guarantor of the Notes, as described in Note 8\nto the consolidated financial statements, for losses suffered solely by reason of fraud or willful misrepresentation by the Operating Partnership or its affiliates. We also provide a similar limited guarantee of the Operating Partnership's obligations with respect to our secured credit facility as of December 31, 2019.\nDebt of the Operating Partnership\nThe

We refinanced the loan secured by one of our consolidated malls to increase the principal balance to $50.0 million and used the net proceeds from the new loan to retire the existing $41.0 million loan. W e repaid two fixed-rate consolidated loans totaling $35.5 million. In conjunction with our deconsolidation of two properties, our joint venture partner assumed $30.0 million of related debt. Lastly, we recognized a $71.7 million gain on extinguishment of debt related to two consolidated malls. See\nNote 7\nand\nNote 8\nto the consolidated financial statements for more information on 2019 loan activity.\nEquity\nAt-The-Market Equity Program\nWe have not sold any shares under the ATM program since 2013. See Note 9\nto the consolidated financial statements for a description of our ATM program.\nPreferred Stock / Preferred Units\nOur authorized preferred stock consists of 15,000,000 shares at $0.01 par value per share. The Operating Partnership issues an equivalent number of preferred units to CBL in exchange for the contribution of the proceeds from CBL to the Operating Partnership when CBL issues preferred stock. The preferred units generally have the same terms and economic characteristics as the corresponding series of preferred stock. See Note 9\nto the consolidated financial statements for a description of our cumulative redeemable preferred stock.\nIn December 2019, we announced the suspension o f all future dividends on our 7.375% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and 6.625% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock , subject to review each quarter by our Board of Directors . Unpaid dividends on the preferred stock will accrue without interest.\nDividends - CBL\nCBL paid a first quarter 2019 cash dividend on its common stock of $0.075 per share on April 16th. Under the terms of the settlement agreement in a class action lawsuit discussed in Item 3 of this report, we did not pay any dividends to holders of our common stock payable in the third and fourth quarters of 2019. As noted above, we suspended all future dividends on our common stock and preferred stock, as well as distributions to all noncontrolling interest investors in our Operating Partnership (as noted below). No dividends may be paid on shares of our common stock unless (i) all accrued but unpaid dividends on our preferred stock, and any current dividend then due, have been paid in cash, or a cash sum sufficient for such payment has been set apart for payment and (ii) the SCU Distribution Shortfall created by our related suspension of distributions to noncontrolling interest investors in our Operating Partnership has likewise been remedied through the payment of distributions sufficient to satisfy such shortfall for all prior periods and the then-current period (thereby allowing the resumption of distributions on the common units in the Operating Partnership that are held by the CBL, which fund our common stock dividends). We will review taxable income on a regular basis and take measures, if necessary, to ensure that we meet the minimum distribution requirements to maintain our status as a REIT.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid dividends of $59.6 million to holders of our common stock and our preferred stock, as well as $18.8 million in distributions to the noncontrolling interest investors in our Operating Partnership and other consolidated subsidiaries.\nDistributions - The Operating Partnership\nThe Operating Partnership paid first, second and third quarter 2019 cash distributions on its redeemable common units of $0.7322 per share on April 16th, July 16th and October 16th. The Operating partnership paid first quarter cash distributions on its common units of $0.075 per share on April 16th. The Operating Partnership has suspended all future distributions until further notice.\nAs a publicly traded company and, as a subsidiary of a publicly traded company, we have access to capital through both the public equity and debt markets. We currently have a shelf registration statement on file with the SEC authorizing us to publicly issue senior and/or subordinated debt securities, shares of preferred stock (or depositary shares representing fractional interests therein), shares of common stock, warrants or rights to purchase any of the foregoing securities, and units consisting of two or more of these classes or series of securities and limited guarantees of debt securities issued by the Operating Partnership. This shelf registration statement also authorized the Operating Partnership to publicly issue unsubordinated debt securities. This shelf registration statement was due to expire in July 2021. However, the Company no longer qualifies as a well-known seasoned issuer under SEC rules, and we therefore are unable to use this shelf registration.\nOur common and preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 2019 was as follows (in thousands, except stock prices):\nTable 296: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Shares\nOutstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Stock\nPrice (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common stock and operating partnership units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 200,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 7.375% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 250.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 6.625% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 250.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 297: <table> <tr> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td> Stock price for common stock and Operating Partnership units equals the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2019.

Our shadow pipeline consists of projects for Properties on which we have completed initial project analysis and design but which have not commenced construction as of December 31, 201 . Except for the projects presented above, we did not have any other material capital commitments as of December 31, 201 .\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nUnconsolidated Affiliates\nWe have ownership interests in 28 unconsolidated affiliates as of December 31, 2019. See Note 7\nto the consolidated financial statements for more information. The unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as investments in unconsolidated affiliates.\nGuarantees\nWe may guarantee the debt of a joint venture primarily because it allows the joint venture to obtain funding at a lower cost than could be obtained otherwise. This results in a higher return for the joint venture on its investment, and a higher return on our investment in the joint venture. We may receive a fee from the joint venture for providing the guaranty. Additionally, when we issue a guaranty, the terms of the joint venture agreement typically provide that we may receive indemnification from the joint venture partner or have the ability to increase our ownership interest.\nSee Note 15\nto the consolidated financial statements for information related to our guarantees of unconsolidated affiliates' debt as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In preparing our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements. Management believes that the following critical accounting policies discussed in this section reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. We have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our board of directors. See Note 2\nof the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in\nItem 8\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our significant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nMinimum rental revenue from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial terms of the related leases. Certain tenants are required to pay percentage rent if their sales volumes exceed thresholds specified in their lease agreements. Percentage rent is recognized as revenue when the thresholds are achieved and the amounts become determinable.\nWe receive reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes, insurance, CAM, and other recoverable operating expenses as provided in the lease agreements. Tenant reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period the related operating expenses are incurred. Tenant reimbursements related to certain capital expenditures are billed to tenants over periods of 5 to 15 years and are recognized as revenue in accordance with underlying lease terms.\nWe receive management, leasing and development fees from third parties and unconsolidated affiliates. Management fees are charged as a percentage of revenues (as defined in the management agreement) and are recognized as revenue when earned. Development fees are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the development period. Leasing fees are charged for newly executed leases and lease renewals and are recognized as revenue when earned. Development and leasing fees received from unconsolidated affiliates during the development period are recognized as\nrevenue to the extent of the third-party partners' ownership interest. Fees to the extent of our ownership interest are recorded as a reduction to our investment in the unconsolidated affiliate.\nGains on sales of real estate assets are recognized when it is determined that the sale has been consummated, the buyer's initial and continuing investment is adequate, our receivable, if any, is not subject to future subordination, and the buyer has assumed the usual risks and rewards of ownership of the asset. When we have an ownership interest in the buyer, gain is recognized to the extent of the third-party partner's ownership interest and the portion of the gain attributable to our ownership interest is deferred.\nReal Estate Assets\nAll acquired real estate assets are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly, the results of operations are included in the consolidated statements of operations from the respective dates of acquisition. The purchase price is allocated to (i) tangible assets, consisting of land, buildings and improvements, as if vacant, and tenant improvements and (ii) identifiable intangible assets and liabilities generally consisting of above- and below-market leases and in-place leases. We use estimates of fair value based on estimated cash flows, using appropriate discount rates, and other valuation methods to allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible and intangible assets. Liabilities assumed generally consist of mortgage debt on the real estate assets acquired. Assumed debt with a stated interest rate that is significantly different from market interest rates is recorded at its fair value based on estimated market interest rates at the date of acquisition. Following our adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a Business , on a prospective basis in January 2017, we expect our future acquisitions will be accounted for as acquisitions of assets in which related transaction costs will be capitalized.\nCarrying Value of Long-Lived Assets\nWe monitor events or changes in circumstances that could indicate the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment are present that suggest that the carrying amounts of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability of the asset by determining whether the asset's carrying value will be recovered through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from our probability weighted use of the asset and its eventual disposition. In the event that such undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, we adjust the carrying value of the long-lived asset to its estimated fair value and recognize an impairment loss. The estimated fair value is calculated based on the following information, in order of preference, depending upon availability: (Level 1) recently quoted market prices, (Level 2) market prices for comparable properties, or (Level 3) the present value of future cash flows, including estimated salvage value. Certain of our long-lived assets may be carried at more than an amount that could be realized in a current disposition transaction. The Company estimates future operating cash flows, the terminal capitalization rate and the discount rate, among other factors. As these assumptions are subject to economic and market uncertainties, they are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter the assumptions used or management's estimates of future possible outcomes. Therefore, the future cash flows estimated in our impairment analyses may not be achieved.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a loss on impairment totaling $239.5 million, which primarily consists of six malls and one community center. During 2018, we recorded a loss on impairment totaling $174.5 million, which primarily consists of $158.4 million attributable to five malls and $16.1 million related to vacant land. During 2017, we recorded a loss on impairment totaling $71.4 million, which was primarily attributable to two malls. See Note 6\nand\nNote 16\nto the consolidated financial statements for additional information about these impairment losses.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Affiliates\nOn a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indicators that the fair value of our investments in unconsolidated affiliates may be impaired. An investment is impaired only if our estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment, and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment. Our estimates of fair value for each investment are based on a number of assumptions such as future leasing expectations, operating forecasts, discount rates and capitalization rates, among others. These assumptions are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, but not limited to, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates, and operating costs. As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions, the fair values estimated in the impairment analyses may not be realized.\nIn 2018, an unconsolidated affiliate recognized an impairment of $89.8 million related to a mall. We recorded $1.0 million as our share of the loss on impairment, which reduced the carrying value of our investment in the joint venture to zero. See\nNote 7\nto the consolidated financial statements for additional information about this impairment loss. No impairments of investments in unconsolidated affiliates were incurred during 2019 and 2017.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2\nto the consolidated financial statements for information on recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nImpact of Inflation and Deflation\nDeflation can result in a decline in general price levels, often caused by a decrease in the supply of money or credit. The predominant effects of deflation are high unemployment, credit contraction and weakened consumer demand. Restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financings or refinancings for our Properties and our tenants' ability to obtain credit. Decreases in consumer demand can have a direct impact on our tenants and the rents we receive.\nDuring inflationary periods, substantially all of our tenant leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the impact of inflation. These provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rent based on tenants' gross sales, which generally increase as prices rise, and/or escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. In addition, many of the leases are for terms of less than ten years, which may provide us the opportunity to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base and/or percentage rent if rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate. Most of the leases require the tenants to pay a fixed amount subject to annual increases for their share of operating expenses, including CAM, real estate taxes, insurance and certain capital expenditures, which reduces our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.\nNon-GAAP Measure\nFunds from Operations\nFFO is a widely used non-GAAP measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that supplements net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d) defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains or losses on sales of depreciable operating properties and impairment losses of depreciable properties, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures and noncontrolling interests. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures and noncontrolling interests are calculated on the same basis. We define FFO as defined above by NAREIT less dividends on preferred stock of the Company or distributions on preferred units of the Operating Partnership, as applicable. Our method of calculating FFO may be different from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.\nWe believe that FFO provides an additional indicator of the operating performance of our Properties without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization, which assumes the value of real estate assets declines predictably over time. Since values of real estate assets have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, we believe that FFO enhances investors' understanding of our operating performance. The use of FFO as an indicator of financial performance is influenced not only by the operations of our Properties and interest rates, but also by our capital structure.\nWe present both FFO allocable to Operating Partnership common unitholders and FFO allocable to common shareholders, as we believe that both are useful performance measures. We believe FFO allocable to Operating Partnership common unitholders is a useful performance measure since we conduct substantially all of our business through our Operating Partnership and, therefore, it reflects the performance of the Properties in absolute terms regardless of the ratio of ownership interests of our common shareholders and the noncontrolling interest in our Operating Partnership. We believe FFO allocable to common shareholders is a useful performance measure because it is the performance measure that is most directly comparable to net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders.\nIn our reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders to FFO allocable to Operating Partnership common unitholders that is presented below, we make an adjustment to add back noncontrolling interest in income (loss) of our Operating Partnership in order to arrive at FFO of the Operating Partnership common unitholders. We then apply a percentage to FFO of our Operating Partnership common unitholders to arrive at FFO allocable to common shareholders. The percentage is computed by taking the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period and dividing it by the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares and the weighted-average number of Operating Partnership units held by noncontrolling interests during the period.\nFFO does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) for purposes of evaluating our operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.\nWe believe that it is important to identify the impact of certain significant items on our FFO measures for a reader to have a complete understanding of our results of operations. Therefore, we have also presented adjusted FFO measures excluding these significant items from the applicable periods. Please refer to the reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders to FFO allocable to Operating Partnership common unitholders below for a description of these adjustments.\nFFO allocable to Operating Partnership common unitholders decreased 17.5% to $280.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $339.8 million for the prior year. After making the adjustments noted below, FFO of the Operating Partnership, as adjusted, decreased 21.3% for the year ending December 31, 2019 to $271.5 million compared to $345.1 million in 2018. The decline in FFO was primarily a result of dilution from asset sales, lower gains on outparcel sales and declines in Property NOI primarily related to retailer and anchor bankruptcies.\nThe reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders to FFO allocable to Operating Partnership common unitholders is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 325: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment are present that suggest that the carrying amounts of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability of the asset by determining whether the asset's carrying value will be recovered through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from our probability weighted use of the asset and its eventual disposition. In the event that such undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, we adjust the carrying value of the long-lived asset to its estimated fair value and recognize an impairment loss. The estimated fair value is calculated based on the following information, in order of preference, depending upon availability: (Level 1) recently quoted market prices, (Level 2) market prices for comparable properties, or (Level 3) the present value of future cash flows, including estimated salvage value. Certain of our long-lived assets may be carried at more than an amount that could be realized in a current disposition transaction. The Company estimates future operating cash flows, the terminal capitalization rate and the discount rate, among other factors. As these assumptions are subject to economic and market uncertainties, they are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter the assumptions used or management's estimates of future possible outcomes. Therefore, the future cash flows estimated in our impairment analyses may not be achieved.\nWe receive reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes, insurance, CAM, and other recoverable operating expenses as provided in the lease agreements. Tenant reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period the related operating expenses are incurred. Tenant reimbursements related to certain capital expenditures are billed to tenants over periods of 5 to 15 years and are recognized as revenue in accordance with underlying lease terms.\nTable 291:

CBL\nIn April 2019, we entered into a settlement agreement and release with respect to a class action lawsuit. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, we did not pay any dividends to holders of our common stock payable in the third and fourth quarters of 2019. Unrelated to the settlement agreement, the board of directors decided to suspend dividends in 2020, subject to quarterly review. See Note 15\nAs a publicly traded company and, as a subsidiary of a publicly traded company, we have access to capital through both the public equity and debt markets. We currently have a shelf registration statement on file with the SEC authorizing us to publicly issue senior and/or subordinated debt securities, shares of preferred stock (or depositary shares representing fractional interests therein), shares of common stock, warrants or rights to purchase any of the foregoing securities, and units consisting of two or more of these classes or series of securities and limited guarantees of debt securities issued by the Operating Partnership. This shelf registration statement also authorized the Operating Partnership to publicly issue unsubordinated debt securities. This shelf registration statement was due to expire in July 2021. However, the Company no longer qualifies as a well-known seasoned issuer under SEC rules, and we therefore are unable to use this shelf registration.\n ( ) This loan has one two-year extension option.

Such Notes may, at the option of the Operating Partnership or the relevant affiliate of the Operating Partnership, be held, resold or surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation.\nOther Income and Expenses\n (2) An unconsolidated affiliate has an interest rate swap on a notional amount of $43,623 as of December 31, 2019 and $44,863 as of December 31, 2018 related to a variable-rate loan on Ambassador Town Center to effectively fix the interest rate on this loan to a fixed-rate of 3.22%. \n (1) Adjustments are based on our Operating Partnership's pro rata ownership share, including our share of unconsolidated affiliates and excluding noncontrolling interests' share of consolidated Properties. \nWe derive the majority of our revenues from the Mall Properties. The sources of our revenues by property type were as follows:\n \nto the consolidated financial statements for additional information about these impairment losses.\nLiquidity and Ca pital Resources\nThe table below presents the Company's compliance with key covenant ratios, as defined, of the Notes as of December 31, 2019.\nDuring 2019, we recognized $239.5 million of loss on impairment of real estate to write down the book value of six malls and one community center. During 2018, we recognized $174.5 million of loss on impairment of real estate to write down the book value of five malls and undeveloped land. See Note 16\n\nIn 2018, an unconsolidated affiliate recognized an impairment of $89.8 million related to a mall. We recorded $1.0 million as our share of the loss on impairment, which reduced the carrying value of our investment in the joint venture to zero. See\nCBL is a limited guarantor of the Notes, as described in Note 8\nWe are continually pursuing new re development opportunities and have projects in various stages of pre-development. Our shadow pipeline consists of projects for Properties on which we have completed initial project analysis and design but which have not commenced construction as of December 31, 201 . Except for the projects presented above, we did not have any other material capital commitments as of December 31, 201 .\nRedevelopments Completed During the\nDistributions - The Operating Partnership\nThe weighted-average remaining term of our total share of consolidated and unconsolidated debt was 3.9 years and 4.0 years at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The weighted-average remaining term of our pro rata share of fixed-rate debt was 4.1 years and 4.8 years at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nto the Year Ended\n (1) Total Cost is presented net of reimbursements to be received. \n This gain was partially offset by a loss on extinguishment of debt from prepayment fees on the early retirement of mortgage loans, net of the noncontrolling interests' share. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid dividends of $59.6 million to holders of our common stock and our preferred stock, as well as $18.8 million in distributions to the noncontrolling interest investors in our Operating Partnership and other consolidated subsidiaries.\n ( ) Yield is based on the expected yield upon stabilization. \n\nto the consolidated financial statements for a description of our ATM program.\nto the consolidated financial statements for more information. The unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as investments in unconsolidated affiliates.\nDeferred maintenance expenditures are generally billed to tenants as CAM expense, and most are recovered over a 5 to 15-year period. Renovation expenditures are primarily for remodeling and upgrades of Malls, of which a portion is recovered from tenants over a 5 to 15-year period. We recover these costs through fixed amounts with annual increases or pro rata cost reimbursements based on the tenant's occupied space.\nto the consolidated financial statements for information on recently issued accounting pronouncements.\n ( ) We replaced our unsecured lines of credit and unsecured terms loans in January 2019 with a new secured senior credit facility. \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that are included in this annual report. Capitalized terms used, but not defined, in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations have the same meanings as defined in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nComparison of the Year Ended\nto the consolidated financial statements for more information on 2019 loan activity.\n(Dollars in thousands)\n\nProperties Opened During the\nImpact of Inflation and Deflation\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nMall store sales include reporting mall tenants of 10,000 square feet or less for Stabilized Malls and exclude license agreements, which are retail contracts that are temporary or short-term in nature and generally last more than three months but less than twelve months. The following is a comparison of our same-center sales per square foot for Mall tenants of 10,000 square feet or less:\n (1) Tenant allowances primarily relate to new leases. Tenant allowances related to renewal leases were not material for the periods presented. \nFFO is a widely used non-GAAP measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that supplements net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d) defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains or losses on sales of depreciable operating properties and impairment losses of depreciable properties, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures and noncontrolling interests. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures and noncontrolling interests are calculated on the same basis. We define FFO as defined above by NAREIT less dividends on preferred stock of the Company or distributions on preferred units of the Operating Partnership, as applicable. Our method of calculating FFO may be different from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased by $9.7 million during 2019 compared to the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense related to the retirement of certain real estate assets and decreases in rental revenues at several malls primarily due to store closures and rent concessions for tenants with high occupancy cost levels, including tenants in bankruptcy.\n \nOperating Expenses\nto the consolidated financial statements, for losses suffered solely by reason of fraud or willful misrepresentation by the Operating Partnership or its affiliates. We also provide a similar limited guarantee of the Operating Partnership's obligations with respect to our secured credit facility as of December 31, 2019.\nWe include a Property in our same-center pool when we have owned all or a portion of the Property since January 1 of the preceding calendar year and it has been in operation for both the entire preceding calendar year ended December 31, 2018 and the current year ended December 31, 2019. New Properties are excluded from same-center NOI, until they meet these criteria. Properties excluded from the same-center pool, which would otherwise meet these criteria, are Properties that are being repositioned or Properties where we are considering alternatives for repositioning, where we intend to renegotiate the terms of the debt secured by the related Property or return the Property to the lender. Greenbrier Mall and Hickory Point Mall were classified as Lender Malls as of December 31, 2019.\nThe Operating Partnership paid first, second and third quarter 2019 cash distributions on its redeemable common units of $0.7322 per share on April 16th, July 16th and October 16th. The Operating partnership paid first quarter cash distributions on its common units of $0.075 per share on April 16th. The Operating Partnership has suspended all future distributions until further notice.\nWe are a self-managed, self-administered, fully integrated REIT that is engaged in the ownership, development, acquisition, leasing, management and operation of regional shopping malls, open-air and mixed-use centers, outlet centers, associated centers, community centers and office properties. Our shopping centers are located in 26 states, but are primarily in the southeastern and midwestern United States. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.\n (3) Obligations where we own the buildings and improvements, but lease the underlying land under long-term ground leases. The maturities of these leases range from 2021 to 2089 and generally provide for renewal options. \nNote 16\nAverage annual base rents per square foot are computed based on contractual rents in effect as of December 31, 201 and 201 , including the impact of any rent concessions. Average annual base rents per square foot for comparable small shop space of less than 10,000 square feet were as follows for each Property type (1) :\n (3) The return reflected represents a pro forma incremental return as Total Cost excludes the cost related to the acquisition of the Sears (Brookfield) and Macy's (Parkdale) buildings in 2017. \nIn 2019, we recognized $16.3 million of gain on sales of real estate assets primarily related to the sale of two centers, a hotel, an office building and seven outparcels. In 2018, we recognized a $19.0 million gain on sales of real estate assets, which included $7.5 million for the sale of four operating properties and $11.5 million related to the sale of 12 outparcels.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSee Note 7\nWe had a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $131.7 million as compared to a net loss of $99.2 million in the prior-year period. The operating results of our Properties declined further in 2019 due to the ongoing challenges in the retail environment that have resulted in tenant bankruptcies, store closures and rental reductions for tenants with high occupancy costs. We recognized non-cash impairment losses of $239.5 million related to six malls and one community center and $61.8 million of expense related to a litigation settlement entered into in 2019, which were partially offset by gain on investments/deconsolidation of $67.2 million related to the sale of a portion of our interests in two joint ventures and a gain on extinguishment of debt of $71.7 million related to two Malls.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a loss on impairment totaling $239.5 million, which primarily consists of six malls and one community center. During 2018, we recorded a loss on impairment totaling $174.5 million, which primarily consists of $158.4 million attributable to five malls and $16.1 million related to vacant land. During 2017, we recorded a loss on impairment totaling $71.4 million, which was primarily attributable to two malls. See Note 6\nThe increase in other revenues of $3.6 million was primarily due to one-time payments from third parties to waive certain restrictions related to prior transactions.\n\nThere was $59.1 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of December 31, 2019, an increase of $1.6 million from December 31, 2018. Of this amount, $32.8 million was unrestricted cash as of December 31, 2019. Our net cash flows are summarized as follows (in thousands):\n ( ) The year ended December 31, 2019 includes non-cash default interest expense related to Acadiana Mall, Cary Towne Center, Greenbrier Mall and Hickory Point Mall. The year ended December 31, 2018 includes non-cash default interest expense related to Acadiana Mall, Cary Towne Center and Triangle Town Center. The year ended December 31, 2017 includes non-cash default interest expense related to Acadiana Mall, Chesterfield Mall, Midland Mall and Wausau Center. \nInterest and other income increased $0.9 million in 2019 compared to the prior-year period primarily due to additional interest income received related to a mortgage note receivable that was retired in the current year.\n (1) Represents same-center sales per square foot for mall tenants 10,000 square feet or less for stabilized malls. \nSee Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for a comparison of the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSame-center NOI (see below) decreased 6.5% as compared to the prior-year period. Stabilized mall same-center sales per square foot increased to $386 for the current year from $379 for the prior-year period. Diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") attributable to common shareholders was ($0.89) per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $(0.72) per diluted share for the prior-year period. FFO, as adjusted, per diluted share (see below) decreased 21.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1.36 per diluted share as compared to $1.73 per diluted share in the prior-year period.\n\nThe reconciliations of FFO allocable to Operating Partnership common unitholders to FFO allocable to common shareholders, including and excluding the adjustments noted above are as follows (in thousands):\n (1) Based on the Operating Partnership's long-term issuer rating. \nNote 7\n (1) As noted in Item 2. Properties , excluded Properties are not included in base rent. Average base rents for associated centers, community centers and office buildings include all leased space, regardless of size. \nThe shopping center business is, to some extent, seasonal in nature with tenants typically achieving the highest levels of sales during the fourth quarter due to the holiday season, which generally results in higher percentage rents in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the malls earn most of their rents from short-term tenants during the holiday period. Thus, occupancy levels and revenue production are generally the highest in the fourth quarter of each year. Results of operations realized in any one quarter may not be indicative of the results likely to be experienced over the course of the fiscal year.\n\nThe following table presents our pro rata share of consolidated and unconsolidated debt as of December 31, 201 , excluding debt premiums and discounts, that is scheduled to mature in 20 (in thousands):\n\n ( ) The year ended December 31, 2019 includes a gain on extinguishment of debt related to the non-recourse loan secured by Acadiana Mall, which was conveyed to the lender in the first quarter of 2019, and a gain on extinguishment of debt related to the non-recourse loan secured by Cary Towne Center, which was sold in the first quarter of 2019. The year ended December 31, 2017 includes a gain on extinguishment of debt of $39,798 related to the non-recourse loans secured by Chesterfield Mall, Midland Mall and Wausau Center which were conveyed to their respective lenders in 2017. \nWe derive the majority of our revenues from leases with retail tenants, which have historically been the primary source for funding short-term liquidity and capital needs such as operating expenses, debt service, tenant construction allowances, recurring capital expenditures, dividends and distributions. We believe that the cash flows generated from our operations, combined with our debt and equity sources, including but not limited to, the availability under our secured line\nOccupancy\nNote 8\nNote 8\nto the consolidated financial statements for a description of our cumulative redeemable preferred stock.\n (4) Represents the remaining balance to be incurred under construction contracts that had been entered into as of December 31, 2019, but were not complete. The contracts are primarily for development of Properties. \nSince NOI includes only those revenues and expenses related to the operations of our shopping center Properties, we believe that same-center NOI provides a measure that reflects trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, sales at the malls and operating costs and the impact of those trends on our results of operations. Our calculation of same-center NOI excludes lease termination income, straight-line rent adjustments, and amortization of above and below market lease intangibles in order to enhance the comparability of results from one period to another.\n (2) Represents average annual base rents for The Outlet Shoppes at Laredo as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. \n \u2022 Cash provided by operating activities during 2019 decreased $103.8 million to $273.4 million from $377.2 million during 2018. The decrease in operating cash flows was primarily due to a decline in rental revenues related to store closures and rent concessions for tenants with high occupancy cost levels, including tenants in bankruptcy, properties that were disposed of and payment of amounts under the class action litigation settlement. \nCapital Expenditures\nWe present both FFO allocable to Operating Partnership common unitholders and FFO allocable to common shareholders, as we believe that both are useful performance measures. We believe FFO allocable to Operating Partnership common unitholders is a useful performance measure since we conduct substantially all of our business through our Operating Partnership and, therefore, it reflects the performance of the Properties in absolute terms regardless of the ratio of ownership interests of our common shareholders and the noncontrolling interest in our Operating Partnership. We believe FFO allocable to common shareholders is a useful performance measure because it is the performance measure that is most directly comparable to net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders.\n\nAll acquired real estate assets are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly, the results of operations are included in the consolidated statements of operations from the respective dates of acquisition. The purchase price is allocated to (i) tangible assets, consisting of land, buildings and improvements, as if vacant, and tenant improvements and (ii) identifiable intangible assets and liabilities generally consisting of above- and below-market leases and in-place leases. We use estimates of fair value based on estimated cash flows, using appropriate discount rates, and other valuation methods to allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible and intangible assets. Liabilities assumed generally consist of mortgage debt on the real estate assets acquired. Assumed debt with a stated interest rate that is significantly different from market interest rates is recorded at its fair value based on estimated market interest rates at the date of acquisition. Following our adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a Business , on a prospective basis in January 2017, we expect our future acquisitions will be accounted for as acquisitions of assets in which related transaction costs will be capitalized.\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nWe receive management, leasing and development fees from third parties and unconsolidated affiliates. Management fees are charged as a percentage of revenues (as defined in the management agreement) and are recognized as revenue when earned. Development fees are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the development period. Leasing fees are charged for newly executed leases and lease renewals and are recognized as revenue when earned. Development and leasing fees received from unconsolidated affiliates during the development period are recognized as\nWe completed several Anchor redevelopments during 201 , adding in a variety of non-traditional tenants, as we continue to reinvent our Properties into suburban town centers.\nIn our reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders to FFO allocable to Operating Partnership common unitholders that is presented below, we make an adjustment to add back noncontrolling interest in income (loss) of our Operating Partnership in order to arrive at FFO of the Operating Partnership common unitholders. We then apply a percentage to FFO of our Operating Partnership common unitholders to arrive at FFO allocable to common shareholders. The percentage is computed by taking the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period and dividing it by the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares and the weighted-average number of Operating Partnership units held by noncontrolling interests during the period.\nof the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in\nWe believe that FFO provides an additional indicator of the operating performance of our Properties without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization, which assumes the value of real estate assets declines predictably over time. Since values of real estate assets have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, we believe that FFO enhances investors' understanding of our operating performance. The use of FFO as an indicator of financial performance is influenced not only by the operations of our Properties and interest rates, but also by our capital structure.\nOn a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indicators that the fair value of our investments in unconsolidated affiliates may be impaired. An investment is impaired only if our estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment, and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment. Our estimates of fair value for each investment are based on a number of assumptions such as future leasing expectations, operating forecasts, discount rates and capitalization rates, among others. These assumptions are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, but not limited to, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates, and operating costs. As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions, the fair values estimated in the impairment analyses may not be realized.\nYear Ended December 31, 201\nSame-center NOI decreased $38.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. The NOI decline of 6.5% for 2019 was driven by a decline in total revenue of $48.8 million offset by a $9.9 million decline in total operating expenses. Rental revenues declined $58.0 million during 2019 primarily due to the impact of store closures and rent concessions for tenants with high occupancy cost levels, including tenants that declared bankruptcy. The decrease in rental revenues includes the impact of $4.8 million of uncollectable revenues, which was formerly categorized as bad debt expense included in property operating expense in the prior-year period. The $9.9 million decrease in total operating expenses was primarily driven by bad debt expense of $5.0 million in the prior-year period and a decrease in real estate tax expense of $4.2 million.\nThe following is a summary of the total square feet of leases signed in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior-year period:\nand\nto the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning the amount and terms of our outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2019.\n (1) Represents principal and interest payments due under the terms of mortgage and other indebtedness, net and includes $951,338 of variable-rate debt service on one operating Property, one construction loan, the secured line of credit and the secured term loan. The secured line of credit does not require scheduled principal payments. The future interest payments are projected based on the interest rates that were in effect at December 31, 2019. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the terms of long-term debt. The total consolidated debt service includes two loans, with an aggregate principal balance of $92,186 as of December 31, 2019, secured by Greenbrier Mall and Hickory Point Mall, which were in default. The Company is in discussion with the lenders. \nSee Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for a comparison of the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nEquity\nDevelopments and Redevelopments\nAt-The-Market Equity Program\nResults of Operations\nThe decrease in management, development and leasing fees of $1.2 million was primarily due to terminated contracts for properties that we were managing for third-party owners.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nWe may guarantee the debt of a joint venture primarily because it allows the joint venture to obtain funding at a lower cost than could be obtained otherwise. This results in a higher return for the joint venture on its investment, and a higher return on our investment in the joint venture. We may receive a fee from the joint venture for providing the guaranty. Additionally, when we issue a guaranty, the terms of the joint venture agreement typically provide that we may receive indemnification from the joint venture partner or have the ability to increase our ownership interest.\nFunds from Operations within the\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $2.7 million primarily due to higher legal expense related to litigation and adopting the new leasing standard in 2019, which resulted in discontinuing capitalizing the cost of leasing personnel for development and redevelopment projects, which were partially offset by reductions in salary and stock compensation costs.\nPartnership common unitholders, and an explanation of why we believe this is a useful performance measure, see Non-GAAP Measure -\nNon-GAAP Measure\nestimated to be uncollectable, substantially all of which was related to the Comparable Properties. The remaining decrease in property operating expenses of the Comparable Properties was primarily due to maintenance and repairs, marketing and payroll expenses. Real estate tax expense declined as a number of the Comparable Properties experienced reductions in real estate taxes in their respective markets.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our pro rata share of consolidated and unconsolidated variable-rate debt represented 22.5% and 22.8%, respectively, of our total pro rata share of debt.\nPreferred Stock / Preferred Units\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements. Management believes that the following critical accounting policies discussed in this section reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. We have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our board of directors. See Note 2\nWe conduct substantially all of our business through the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership consolidates the financial statements of all entities in which it has a controlling financial interest or where it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. See Item 1. Business\nand\nAnnual capital expenditures budgets are prepared for each of our Properties that are intended to provide for all necessary recurring and non-recurring capital expenditures. We believe that property operating cash flows, which include reimbursements from tenants for certain expenses, will provide the necessary funding for these expenditures.\nResults from new and renewal leasing of comparable small shop space of less than 10,000 square feet during the year ended December 31, 2019 for spaces that were previously occupied, based on the contractual terms of the related leases inclusive of the impact of any rent concessions, are as follows:\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nWe are working to diversify and stabilize revenues. In recent months, we have opened 15 new tenants in former anchor locations, adding more productive, higher traffic-driving uses. Also, we have another dozen committed replacements either under construction or with planning underway. We are proactively reducing our exposure to apparel retailers with more than 76% of 2019 mall leasing completed with non-apparel tenants.\nOur common and preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 2019 was as follows (in thousands, except stock prices):\nWe compute NOI based on the Operating Partnership's pro rata share of both consolidated and unconsolidated Properties. We believe that presenting NOI and same-center NOI (described below) based on our Operating Partnership's pro rata share of both consolidated and unconsolidated Properties is useful since we conduct substantially all of our business through our Operating Partnership and, therefore, it reflects the performance of the Properties in absolute terms regardless of the ratio of ownership interests of our common shareholders and the noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership. Our definition of NOI may be different than that used by other companies, and accordingly, our calculation of NOI may not be comparable to that of other companies.\nMortgages on Operating Properties\nDecember 31, 2019\n (3) An unconsolidated affiliate has an interest rate swap on a notional amount of $10,050 as of December 31, 2019 and $10,605 as of December 31, 2018 related to a variable-rate loan on Ambassador Town Center - Infrastructure Improvements to effectively fix the interest rate on this loan to a fixed-rate of 3.74%. \nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $310.9 million outstanding on our secured line of credit leaving $374.1 million of availability, after considering outstanding letters of credit of $4.8 million, as well as unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $32.8 million. Our total pro rata share of debt at December 31, 2019 was $4.3 billion. Our consolidated unencumbered properties generated approximately 27.4% of total consolidated NOI for the year ended December 31, 2019 (excluding dispositions and Excluded Malls).\nFunds from Operations\n\n \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nContractual Obligations\nIn January 2019, we entered into a new $1.185 billion senior secured credit facility, which included a fully-funded $500 million term loan and a revolving line of credit with a borrowing capacity of $685 million. The facility replaced all of the Company's prior unsecured bank facilities, which included three unsecured term loans with an aggregate balance of $695 million and three unsecured revolving lines of credit with an aggregate capacity of $1.1 billion. At closing, we utilized the line of credit to reduce the principal balance of the unsecured term loans from $695 million to $500 million. The facility matures in July 2023 and bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 2.25%. The Operating Partnership is required to pay an annual facility fee on the line of credit balance, to be paid quarterly, which ranges from 0.25% to 0.35%, based on the unused capacity of the line of credit. The principal balance on the term loan will be reduced by $35 million per year in quarterly installments. The senior secured credit facility is secured by a portfolio of the Company's Properties consisting of seventeen malls and three associated centers. The facility contains customary provisions upon which the Properties may be released from the collateral securing the Facility. The senior secured credit facility contains, among other restrictions, various restrictive covenants that are defined and computed on the same basis as the covenants required under the Notes. Such covenants relate to the Operating Partnership's and the Company's aggregate unsecured debt, aggregate secured debt, maintenance of unencumbered assets and debt service coverage. The Credit Agreement for the senior secured credit facility contains default and cross-default provisions customary for transactions of this nature (with applicable customary grace periods). Any default (i) in the payment of any recourse indebtedness greater than or equal to $50.0 million (for the Company's ownership share), or any non-recourse indebtedness greater than or equal to $150.0 million (for the Company's ownership share) or (ii) that results in the acceleration of the maturity of recourse indebtedness greater than or equal to $50.0 million (for the Company's ownership share), or any non-recourse indebtedness greater than or equal to $150.0 million (for the Company's ownership share) of the Company or the Operating Partnership will constitute an event of default under the Credit Agreement. At all times during the term of the Credit Agreement, there shall be no fewer than ten Borrowing Base Properties (as defined in the Credit Agreement) which have an aggregate occupancy rate of not less than 80% on a quarterly basis. In addition, at all times the Company shall be required to maintain a minimum debt yield of 10% for the Borrowing Base Properties based on the outstanding balance of the facility. The Credit Agreement provides that, upon the occurrence and continuation of an event of default, payment of all amounts outstanding under the facility may be accelerated and the lenders' commitments may be terminated. The Company is a limited guarantor of the Operating Partnership's obligations under the terms of the new Credit Agreement.\nCBL has no indebtedness. Either the Operating Partnership or one of its consolidated subsidiaries, that it has a direct or indirect ownership interest in, is the borrower on all of our debt.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Affiliates\nLeasing\nrevenue to the extent of the third-party partners' ownership interest. Fees to the extent of our ownership interest are recorded as a reduction to our investment in the unconsolidated affiliate.\nCBL paid a first quarter 2019 cash dividend on its common stock of $0.075 per share on April 16th. Under the terms of the settlement agreement in a class action lawsuit discussed in Item 3 of this report, we did not pay any dividends to holders of our common stock payable in the third and fourth quarters of 2019. As noted above, we suspended all future dividends on our common stock and preferred stock, as well as distributions to all noncontrolling interest investors in our Operating Partnership (as noted below). No dividends may be paid on shares of our common stock unless (i) all accrued but unpaid dividends on our preferred stock, and any current dividend then due, have been paid in cash, or a cash sum sufficient for such payment has been set apart for payment and (ii) the SCU Distribution Shortfall created by our related suspension of distributions to noncontrolling interest investors in our Operating Partnership has likewise been remedied through the payment of distributions sufficient to satisfy such shortfall for all prior periods and the then-current period (thereby allowing the resumption of distributions on the common units in the Operating Partnership that are held by the CBL, which fund our common stock dividends). We will review taxable income on a regular basis and take measures, if necessary, to ensure that we meet the minimum distribution requirements to maintain our status as a REIT.\n ( ) The balance is net of an unamortized discount of $7,527 and $8,365 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. \nReal Estate Assets\nUnconsolidated Affiliates\nShadow Development Pipeline\n\nDebt of the Operating Partnership\n\"Liquidity and Capital Resources\"\nYear Ended December 31, 2019\nCredit Ratings\nDecember 31, 2018\nRental revenues from the Comparable Properties declined primarily due to store closures and rent concessions for tenants with high occupancy cost levels, including tenants that declared bankruptcy in 2019 and 2018.\nIn 2019, we entered into four unconsolidated construction loans totaling $38.3 million. We refinanced the loan secured by one of our consolidated malls to increase the principal balance to $50.0 million and used the net proceeds from the new loan to retire the existing $41.0 million loan. W e repaid two fixed-rate consolidated loans totaling $35.5 million. In conjunction with our deconsolidation of two properties, our joint venture partner assumed $30.0 million of related debt. Lastly, we recognized a $71.7 million gain on extinguishment of debt related to two consolidated malls. See\n\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\nAverage leasing spreads for comparable space under 10,000 square feet in our stabilized malls were down 8.6% for leases signed in 2019, including a 11.5% decrease in renewal lease rates and a 9.1% increase for new leases.

The reduction in our common and preferred stock dividend resulted in savings in dividends and distributions paid to common and preferred shareholders and the noncontrolling interest holders in the Operating Partnership. This was partially offset by the additional principal payments on debt and the payment of deferred financing costs, which were mostly related to our new secured credit facility. \n (3) Yield is based on the expected yield upon stabilization. \nItem 8\nDeflation can result in a decline in general price levels, often caused by a decrease in the supply of money or credit. The predominant effects of deflation are high unemployment, credit contraction and weakened consumer demand. Restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financings or refinancings for our Properties and our tenants' ability to obtain credit. Decreases in consumer demand can have a direct impact on our tenants and the rents we receive.\nWe believe that it is important to identify the impact of certain significant items on our FFO measures for a reader to have a complete understanding of our results of operations. Therefore, we have also presented adjusted FFO measures excluding these significant items from the applicable periods. Please refer to the reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders to FFO allocable to Operating Partnership common unitholders below for a description of these adjustments.\nDebt of the Company\nAs our results for 2019 and guidance for 2020 indicate, we are facing ongoing challenges, including heightened bankruptcy and store closure activity from retailers as they struggle to succeed in an increasingly competitive and fast-changing industry. Revenues and occupancy were significantly impacted by retailer bankruptcies, store closings, including the liquidation or reorganization of several major retailers, and rent reductions for tenants with high occupancy costs.\n (4) The return reflected represents a pro forma incremental return as Total Cost excludes the cost related to the acquisition of the Sears (Hamilton Place) building in 2017. \nRevenues\nThe $15.0 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of the Comparable Properties is primarily due to write-offs of tenant improvements and intangible lease assets related to store closings in the prior year period, as well as a lower basis in depreciable assets resulting from impairments recorded in 2018 and 2019.\nIn addition, $92.2 million of our pro rata share of consolidated and unconsolidated debt is related to two operating property loans, Greenbrier Mall and Hickory Point Mall, which matured in 2019. We are in discussions with the lenders regarding both loans.\n (1) The year ended December 31, 2019 is comprised of the accrued maximum expense of $88,150 recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2019 less total subsequent reductions of $26,396 pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement related to past tenants that did not submit a claim pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, tenants that opted out of the lawsuit and other permissible reductions. Litigation expense and nonrecurring professional fees expense, including settlements paid, are included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Nonrecurring professional fees reimbursement is included in interest and other income in the consolidated statements of operations. \nNote 7\nThe following table, which excludes expenditures for developments and expansions, summarizes these capital expenditures, including our share of unconsolidated affiliates' capital expenditures, for the year ended December 31, 201 compared to 201 (in thousands):\nto the consolidated financial statements for more information.\n (1 ) Weighted-average interest rate includes the effect of debt premiums and discounts, but excludes amortization of deferred financing costs. \n\nto the consolidated financial statements for more information on 2019 loan activity.\nIn 2019, we entered into four unconsolidated construction loans totaling $38.3 million. We refinanced the loan secured by one of our consolidated malls to increase the principal balance to $50.0 million and used the net proceeds from the new loan to retire the existing $41.0 million loan. Also, we exercised an option to extend the loan secured by a consolidated mall to May 2021. In conjunction with the extension, a payment of $10.8 million was made to reduce the outstanding balance of the loan to $43.0 million, of which our joint venture partner funded its 35% share.

In preparing our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\n (2) Average gross rent does not incorporate allowable future increases for recoverable CAM expenses. \nFFO does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) for purposes of evaluating our operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.\nto the consolidated financial statements for information related to our guarantees of unconsolidated affiliates' debt as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nThe reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders to FFO allocable to Operating Partnership common unitholders is as follows (in thousands):\n ( ) The balance is net of an unamortized discount of $40 and $47 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. \nIn December 2019, we announced the suspension o f all future dividends on our 7.375% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and 6.625% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock , subject to review each quarter by our Board of Directors . Unpaid dividends on the preferred stock will accrue without interest.\nGains on sales of real estate assets are recognized when it is determined that the sale has been consummated, the buyer's initial and continuing investment is adequate, our receivable, if any, is not subject to future subordination, and the buyer has assumed the usual risks and rewards of ownership of the asset. When we have an ownership interest in the buyer, gain is recognized to the extent of the third-party partner's ownership interest and the portion of the gain attributable to our ownership interest is deferred.\nMinimum rental revenue from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial terms of the related leases. Certain tenants are required to pay percentage rent if their sales volumes exceed thresholds specified in their lease agreements. Percentage rent is recognized as revenue when the thresholds are achieved and the amounts become determinable.\nof credit , the suspension of dividends on our preferred stock and common stock and proceeds from dispositions will, for the foreseeable future, provide adequate liquidity to meet our cash needs. In addition to these factors, subject to market conditions, we have options available to us to generate additional liquidity, including but not limited to, debt and equity offerings, joint venture investments, issuances of noncontrolling interests in our Operating Partnership, and decreasing expenditures related to tenant construction allowances and other capital expenditures. We also generate revenues from sales of peripheral land at our properties and from sales of real estate assets when it is determined that we can realize an optimal value for the assets.\nThe income tax provision of $3.2 million in 2019 relates to the Management Company, which is a taxable REIT subsidiary, and consists of a current tax provision of $0.5 million and a deferred tax provision of $2.7 million.

See Note 15\n (4) NOI is derived from unencumbered Tier One Malls, as well as unencumbered portions of Tier One Malls that are otherwise secured by a loan. The unencumbered portions include outparcels, Anchors and former Anchors that have been redeveloped. \n (3) Our consolidated unencumbered properties generated approximately 27.4% of total consolidated NOI of $501,171,170 (which excludes NOI related to dispositions) for the year ended December 31, 2019. \nNote 7\n (2) Operating metrics are included for unencumbered consolidated operating properties and do not include sales or occupancy of unencumbered parcels. \n \u2022 Cash provided by investing activities during 2019 was $24.6 million, representing a $52.1 million difference as compared to cash used by investing activities of $27.5 million in the prior-year period. The cash inflow for 2019 was primarily related to a greater amount of proceeds from sales in the current year combined with lower cash paid for capital expenditures as we continue to focus on controlling such expenditures. These increases were partially offset by a lower amount of distributions from unconsolidated affiliates in 2019 as we received a distribution from an unconsolidated affiliate in 2018 related to excess proceeds from the refinancing of a mortgage loan. \n\n ( ) Represents a $43,716 non-recourse mortgage loan secured by Cary Towne Center that was classified on the consolidated balance sheet as liabilities related to assets held for sale. \nand\n (1) The debt covenant compliance ratios for the secured line of credit, the secured term loan and the senior unsecured notes are defined and computed on the same basis. \nDuring 2019, we recorded $67.2 million of gain on deconsolidation related to The Outlet Shoppes at El Paso and The Outlet Shoppes at Atlanta.

While the industry and our Company continue to face challenges, some of which may not be in our control, we believe that the strategies in place to redevelop our Properties and diversify our tenant mix will contribute to stabilization of our portfolio and revenues in future years.\nWe had the following credit ratings as of December 31, 2019:\nInterest expense decreased $13.8 million in 2019 compared to the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily due to a $13.5 million decrease in property-level interest expense, including default interest expense, due to dispositions of encumbered properties during 2019 and a paydown in May 2019 of a portion of the loan that is secured by The Outlet Shoppes at Laredo. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $3.2 million in corporate-level interest expense due to higher variable rates on our corporate-level debt as compared to the prior-year, partially related to the higher interest rate on our new secured credit facility as compared with the previous credit facility, as well as increases in LIBOR.\n (1) Total Cost is presented net of reimbursements to be received. \n (1) Total Cost is presented net of reimbursements to be received. \nDuring 2019, we recorded $71.7 million of gain on extinguishment of debt related to two malls.

We also significantly extended our debt maturity schedule by replacing our unsecured credit facilities and unsecured term loans with a new $1.185 billion secured facility with 16 banks that closed in January 2019, which provides us the flexibility to execute on our operational and redevelopment goals. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nCash Flows - Operating, Investing and Financing Activities\nDuring inflationary periods, substantially all of our tenant leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the impact of inflation. These provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rent based on tenants' gross sales, which generally increase as prices rise, and/or escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. In addition, many of the leases are for terms of less than ten years, which may provide us the opportunity to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base and/or percentage rent if rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate. Most of the leases require the tenants to pay a fixed amount subject to annual increases for their share of operating expenses, including CAM, real estate taxes, insurance and certain capital expenditures, which reduces our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our significant accounting policies.", "item_7_text": "Note 8\n\nDuring 2019, we reduced our total pro rata share of debt by $409.0 million excluding debt issuance costs.

When indicators of potential impairment are present that suggest that the carrying amounts of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability of the asset by determining whether the asset's carrying value will be recovered through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from our probability weighted use of the asset and its eventual disposition. In the event that such undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, we adjust the carrying value of the long-lived asset to its estimated fair value and recognize an impairment loss. The estimated fair value is calculated based on the following information, in order of preference, depending upon availability: (Level 1) recently quoted market prices, (Level 2) market prices for comparable properties, or (Level 3) the present value of future cash flows, including estimated salvage value. Certain of our long-lived assets may be carried at more than an amount that could be realized in a current disposition transaction. The Company estimates future operating cash flows, the terminal capitalization rate and the discount rate, among other factors. As these assumptions are subject to economic and market uncertainties, they are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter the assumptions used or management's estimates of future possible outcomes. Therefore, the future cash flows estimated in our impairment analyses may not be achieved.\nWe receive reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes, insurance, CAM, and other recoverable operating expenses as provided in the lease agreements. Tenant reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period the related operating expenses are incurred. Tenant reimbursements related to certain capital expenditures are billed to tenants over periods of 5 to 15 years and are recognized as revenue in accordance with underlying lease terms.\n (1) Stock price for common stock and Operating Partnership units equals the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2019.

After making the adjustments noted below, FFO of the Operating Partnership, as adjusted, decreased 21.3% for the year ending December 31, 2019 to $271.5 million compared to $345.1 million in 2018. The decline in FFO was primarily a result of dilution from asset sales, lower gains on outparcel sales and declines in Property NOI primarily related to retailer and anchor bankruptcies.\n\n\nWe have ownership interests in 28 unconsolidated affiliates as of December 31, 2019. See Note 7\n\nDividends - CBL\nIn April 2019, we entered into a settlement agreement and release with respect to a class action lawsuit. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, we did not pay any dividends to holders of our common stock payable in the third and fourth quarters of 2019. Unrelated to the settlement agreement, the board of directors decided to suspend dividends in 2020, subject to quarterly review. See Note 15\nAs a publicly traded company and, as a subsidiary of a publicly traded company, we have access to capital through both the public equity and debt markets. We currently have a shelf registration statement on file with the SEC authorizing us to publicly issue senior and/or subordinated debt securities, shares of preferred stock (or depositary shares representing fractional interests therein), shares of common stock, warrants or rights to purchase any of the foregoing securities, and units consisting of two or more of these classes or series of securities and limited guarantees of debt securities issued by the Operating Partnership. This shelf registration statement also authorized the Operating Partnership to publicly issue unsubordinated debt securities. This shelf registration statement was due to expire in July 2021. However, the Company no longer qualifies as a well-known seasoned issuer under SEC rules, and we therefore are unable to use this shelf registration.\n ( ) This loan has one two-year extension option. \n (2) Yield is based on expected yield upon stabilization. \n (1) Includes Stabilized Malls, associated centers, community centers and other. \n\n (2) Cost to Date does not reflect reimbursements until they are received. \n \nProperty operating expenses at the Comparable Properties decreased primarily due to a change in the classification of bad debt expense as a result of the adoption of ASC 842 effective January 1, 2019.

During 2018, we recognized $174.5 million of loss on impairment of real estate to write down the book value of five malls and undeveloped land. See Note 16\n\nIn 2018, an unconsolidated affiliate recognized an impairment of $89.8 million related to a mall.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nMall store sales include reporting mall tenants of 10,000 square feet or less for Stabilized Malls and exclude license agreements, which are retail contracts that are temporary or short-term in nature and generally last more than three months but less than twelve months. The following is a comparison of our same-center sales per square foot for Mall tenants of 10,000 square feet or less:\n (1) Tenant allowances primarily relate to new leases. Tenant allowances related to renewal leases were not material for the periods presented. \nFFO is a widely used non-GAAP measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that supplements net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d) defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains or losses on sales of depreciable operating properties and impairment losses of depreciable properties, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures and noncontrolling interests. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures and noncontrolling interests are calculated on the same basis. We define FFO as defined above by NAREIT less dividends on preferred stock of the Company or distributions on preferred units of the Operating Partnership, as applicable. Our method of calculating FFO may be different from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased by $9.7 million during 2019 compared to the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense related to the retirement of certain real estate assets and decreases in rental revenues at several malls primarily due to store closures and rent concessions for tenants with high occupancy cost levels, including tenants in bankruptcy.\n \nOperating Expenses\nto the consolidated financial statements, for losses suffered solely by reason of fraud or willful misrepresentation by the Operating Partnership or its affiliates. We also provide a similar limited guarantee of the Operating Partnership's obligations with respect to our secured credit facility as of December 31, 2019.\nWe include a Property in our same-center pool when we have owned all or a portion of the Property since January 1 of the preceding calendar year and it has been in operation for both the entire preceding calendar year ended December 31, 2018 and the current year ended December 31, 2019. New Properties are excluded from same-center NOI, until they meet these criteria. Properties excluded from the same-center pool, which would otherwise meet these criteria, are Properties that are being repositioned or Properties where we are considering alternatives for repositioning, where we intend to renegotiate the terms of the debt secured by the related Property or return the Property to the lender. Greenbrier Mall and Hickory Point Mall were classified as Lender Malls as of December 31, 2019.\nThe Operating Partnership paid first, second and third quarter 2019 cash distributions on its redeemable common units of $0.7322 per share on April 16th, July 16th and October 16th. The Operating partnership paid first quarter cash distributions on its common units of $0.075 per share on April 16th. The Operating Partnership has suspended all future distributions until further notice.\nWe are a self-managed, self-administered, fully integrated REIT that is engaged in the ownership, development, acquisition, leasing, management and operation of regional shopping malls, open-air and mixed-use centers, outlet centers, associated centers, community centers and office properties. Our shopping centers are located in 26 states, but are primarily in the southeastern and midwestern United States. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.\n (3) Obligations where we own the buildings and improvements, but lease the underlying land under long-term ground leases. The maturities of these leases range from 2021 to 2089 and generally provide for renewal options. \nNote 16\nAverage annual base rents per square foot are computed based on contractual rents in effect as of December 31, 201 and 201 , including the impact of any rent concessions. Average annual base rents per square foot for comparable small shop space of less than 10,000 square feet were as follows for each Property type (1) :\n (3) The return reflected represents a pro forma incremental return as Total Cost excludes the cost related to the acquisition of the Sears (Brookfield) and Macy's (Parkdale) buildings in 2017. \nIn 2019, we recognized $16.3 million of gain on sales of real estate assets primarily related to the sale of two centers, a hotel, an office building and seven outparcels. In 2018, we recognized a $19.0 million gain on sales of real estate assets, which included $7.5 million for the sale of four operating properties and $11.5 million related to the sale of 12 outparcels.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSee Note 7\nWe had a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $131.7 million as compared to a net loss of $99.2 million in the prior-year period. The operating results of our Properties declined further in 2019 due to the ongoing challenges in the retail environment that have resulted in tenant bankruptcies, store closures and rental reductions for tenants with high occupancy costs. We recognized non-cash impairment losses of $239.5 million related to six malls and one community center and $61.8 million of expense related to a litigation settlement entered into in 2019, which were partially offset by gain on investments/deconsolidation of $67.2 million related to the sale of a portion of our interests in two joint ventures and a gain on extinguishment of debt of $71.7 million related to two Malls.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a loss on impairment totaling $239.5 million, which primarily consists of six malls and one community center. During 2018, we recorded a loss on impairment totaling $174.5 million, which primarily consists of $158.4 million attributable to five malls and $16.1 million related to vacant land. During 2017, we recorded a loss on impairment totaling $71.4 million, which was primarily attributable to two malls. See Note 6\nThe increase in other revenues of $3.6 million was primarily due to one-time payments from third parties to waive certain restrictions related to prior transactions.\n\nThere was $59.1 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of December 31, 2019, an increase of $1.6 million from December 31, 2018. Of this amount, $32.8 million was unrestricted cash as of December 31, 2019. Our net cash flows are summarized as follows (in thousands):\n ( ) The year ended December 31, 2019 includes non-cash default interest expense related to Acadiana Mall, Cary Towne Center, Greenbrier Mall and Hickory Point Mall. The year ended December 31, 2018 includes non-cash default interest expense related to Acadiana Mall, Cary Towne Center and Triangle Town Center. The year ended December 31, 2017 includes non-cash default interest expense related to Acadiana Mall, Chesterfield Mall, Midland Mall and Wausau Center. \nInterest and other income increased $0.9 million in 2019 compared to the prior-year period primarily due to additional interest income received related to a mortgage note receivable that was retired in the current year.\n (1) Represents same-center sales per square foot for mall tenants 10,000 square feet or less for stabilized malls. \nSee Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for a comparison of the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSame-center NOI (see below) decreased 6.5% as compared to the prior-year period. Stabilized mall same-center sales per square foot increased to $386 for the current year from $379 for the prior-year period. Diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") attributable to common shareholders was ($0.89) per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $(0.72) per diluted share for the prior-year period. FFO, as adjusted, per diluted share (see below) decreased 21.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1.36 per diluted share as compared to $1.73 per diluted share in the prior-year period.\n\nThe reconciliations of FFO allocable to Operating Partnership common unitholders to FFO allocable to common shareholders, including and excluding the adjustments noted above are as follows (in thousands):\n (1) Based on the Operating Partnership's long-term issuer rating. \nNote 7\n (1) As noted in Item 2. Properties , excluded Properties are not included in base rent. Average base rents for associated centers, community centers and office buildings include all leased space, regardless of size. \nThe shopping center business is, to some extent, seasonal in nature with tenants typically achieving the highest levels of sales during the fourth quarter due to the holiday season, which generally results in higher percentage rents in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the malls earn most of their rents from short-term tenants during the holiday period. Thus, occupancy levels and revenue production are generally the highest in the fourth quarter of each year. Results of operations realized in any one quarter may not be indicative of the results likely to be experienced over the course of the fiscal year.\n\nThe following table presents our pro rata share of consolidated and unconsolidated debt as of December 31, 201 , excluding debt premiums and discounts, that is scheduled to mature in 20 (in thousands):\n\n ( ) The year ended December 31, 2019 includes a gain on extinguishment of debt related to the non-recourse loan secured by Acadiana Mall, which was conveyed to the lender in the first quarter of 2019, and a gain on extinguishment of debt related to the non-recourse loan secured by Cary Towne Center, which was sold in the first quarter of 2019. The year ended December 31, 2017 includes a gain on extinguishment of debt of $39,798 related to the non-recourse loans secured by Chesterfield Mall, Midland Mall and Wausau Center which were conveyed to their respective lenders in 2017. \nWe derive the majority of our revenues from leases with retail tenants, which have historically been the primary source for funding short-term liquidity and capital needs such as operating expenses, debt service, tenant construction allowances, recurring capital expenditures, dividends and distributions. We believe that the cash flows generated from our operations, combined with our debt and equity sources, including but not limited to, the availability under our secured line\nOccupancy\nNote 8\nNote 8\nto the consolidated financial statements for a description of our cumulative redeemable preferred stock.\n (4) Represents the remaining balance to be incurred under construction contracts that had been entered into as of December 31, 2019, but were not complete. The contracts are primarily for development of Properties. \nSince NOI includes only those revenues and expenses related to the operations of our shopping center Properties, we believe that same-center NOI provides a measure that reflects trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, sales at the malls and operating costs and the impact of those trends on our results of operations. Our calculation of same-center NOI excludes lease termination income, straight-line rent adjustments, and amortization of above and below market lease intangibles in order to enhance the comparability of results from one period to another.\n (2) Represents average annual base rents for The Outlet Shoppes at Laredo as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. \n \u2022 Cash provided by operating activities during 2019 decreased $103.8 million to $273.4 million from $377.2 million during 2018. The decrease in operating cash flows was primarily due to a decline in rental revenues related to store closures and rent concessions for tenants with high occupancy cost levels, including tenants in bankruptcy, properties that were disposed of and payment of amounts under the class action litigation settlement. \nCapital Expenditures\nWe present both FFO allocable to Operating Partnership common unitholders and FFO allocable to common shareholders, as we believe that both are useful performance measures. We believe FFO allocable to Operating Partnership common unitholders is a useful performance measure since we conduct substantially all of our business through our Operating Partnership and, therefore, it reflects the performance of the Properties in absolute terms regardless of the ratio of ownership interests of our common shareholders and the noncontrolling interest in our Operating Partnership. We believe FFO allocable to common shareholders is a useful performance measure because it is the performance measure that is most directly comparable to net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders.\n\nAll acquired real estate assets are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly, the results of operations are included in the consolidated statements of operations from the respective dates of acquisition. The purchase price is allocated to (i) tangible assets, consisting of land, buildings and improvements, as if vacant, and tenant improvements and (ii) identifiable intangible assets and liabilities generally consisting of above- and below-market leases and in-place leases. We use estimates of fair value based on estimated cash flows, using appropriate discount rates, and other valuation methods to allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible and intangible assets. Liabilities assumed generally consist of mortgage debt on the real estate assets acquired. Assumed debt with a stated interest rate that is significantly different from market interest rates is recorded at its fair value based on estimated market interest rates at the date of acquisition. Following our adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a Business , on a prospective basis in January 2017, we expect our future acquisitions will be accounted for as acquisitions of assets in which related transaction costs will be capitalized.\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nWe receive management, leasing and development fees from third parties and unconsolidated affiliates. Management fees are charged as a percentage of revenues (as defined in the management agreement) and are recognized as revenue when earned. Development fees are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the development period. Leasing fees are charged for newly executed leases and lease renewals and are recognized as revenue when earned. Development and leasing fees received from unconsolidated affiliates during the development period are recognized as\nWe completed several Anchor redevelopments during 201 , adding in a variety of non-traditional tenants, as we continue to reinvent our Properties into suburban town centers.\nIn our reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders to FFO allocable to Operating Partnership common unitholders that is presented below, we make an adjustment to add back noncontrolling interest in income (loss) of our Operating Partnership in order to arrive at FFO of the Operating Partnership common unitholders. We then apply a percentage to FFO of our Operating Partnership common unitholders to arrive at FFO allocable to common shareholders. The percentage is computed by taking the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period and dividing it by the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares and the weighted-average number of Operating Partnership units held by noncontrolling interests during the period.\nof the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in\nWe believe that FFO provides an additional indicator of the operating performance of our Properties without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization, which assumes the value of real estate assets declines predictably over time. Since values of real estate assets have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, we believe that FFO enhances investors' understanding of our operating performance. The use of FFO as an indicator of financial performance is influenced not only by the operations of our Properties and interest rates, but also by our capital structure.\nOn a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indicators that the fair value of our investments in unconsolidated affiliates may be impaired. An investment is impaired only if our estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment, and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment. Our estimates of fair value for each investment are based on a number of assumptions such as future leasing expectations, operating forecasts, discount rates and capitalization rates, among others. These assumptions are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, but not limited to, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates, and operating costs. As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions, the fair values estimated in the impairment analyses may not be realized.\nYear Ended December 31, 201\nSame-center NOI decreased $38.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. The NOI decline of 6.5% for 2019 was driven by a decline in total revenue of $48.8 million offset by a $9.9 million decline in total operating expenses. Rental revenues declined $58.0 million during 2019 primarily due to the impact of store closures and rent concessions for tenants with high occupancy cost levels, including tenants that declared bankruptcy. The decrease in rental revenues includes the impact of $4.8 million of uncollectable revenues, which was formerly categorized as bad debt expense included in property operating expense in the prior-year period. The $9.9 million decrease in total operating expenses was primarily driven by bad debt expense of $5.0 million in the prior-year period and a decrease in real estate tax expense of $4.2 million.\nThe following is a summary of the total square feet of leases signed in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior-year period:\nand\nto the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning the amount and terms of our outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2019.\n (1) Represents principal and interest payments due under the terms of mortgage and other indebtedness, net and includes $951,338 of variable-rate debt service on one operating Property, one construction loan, the secured line of credit and the secured term loan. The secured line of credit does not require scheduled principal payments. The future interest payments are projected based on the interest rates that were in effect at December 31, 2019. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the terms of long-term debt. The total consolidated debt service includes two loans, with an aggregate principal balance of $92,186 as of December 31, 2019, secured by Greenbrier Mall and Hickory Point Mall, which were in default. The Company is in discussion with the lenders. \nSee Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for a comparison of the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nEquity\nDevelopments and Redevelopments\nAt-The-Market Equity Program\nResults of Operations\nThe decrease in management, development and leasing fees of $1.2 million was primarily due to terminated contracts for properties that we were managing for third-party owners.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nWe may guarantee the debt of a joint venture primarily because it allows the joint venture to obtain funding at a lower cost than could be obtained otherwise. This results in a higher return for the joint venture on its investment, and a higher return on our investment in the joint venture. We may receive a fee from the joint venture for providing the guaranty. Additionally, when we issue a guaranty, the terms of the joint venture agreement typically provide that we may receive indemnification from the joint venture partner or have the ability to increase our ownership interest.\nFunds from Operations within the\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $2.7 million primarily due to higher legal expense related to litigation and adopting the new leasing standard in 2019, which resulted in discontinuing capitalizing the cost of leasing personnel for development and redevelopment projects, which were partially offset by reductions in salary and stock compensation costs.\nPartnership common unitholders, and an explanation of why we believe this is a useful performance measure, see Non-GAAP Measure -\nNon-GAAP Measure\nestimated to be uncollectable, substantially all of which was related to the Comparable Properties. The remaining decrease in property operating expenses of the Comparable Properties was primarily due to maintenance and repairs, marketing and payroll expenses. Real estate tax expense declined as a number of the Comparable Properties experienced reductions in real estate taxes in their respective markets.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our pro rata share of consolidated and unconsolidated variable-rate debt represented 22.5% and 22.8%, respectively, of our total pro rata share of debt.\nPreferred Stock / Preferred Units\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements. Management believes that the following critical accounting policies discussed in this section reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. We have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our board of directors. See Note 2\nWe conduct substantially all of our business through the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership consolidates the financial statements of all entities in which it has a controlling financial interest or where it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. See Item 1. Business\nand\nAnnual capital expenditures budgets are prepared for each of our Properties that are intended to provide for all necessary recurring and non-recurring capital expenditures. We believe that property operating cash flows, which include reimbursements from tenants for certain expenses, will provide the necessary funding for these expenditures.\nResults from new and renewal leasing of comparable small shop space of less than 10,000 square feet during the year ended December 31, 2019 for spaces that were previously occupied, based on the contractual terms of the related leases inclusive of the impact of any rent concessions, are as follows:\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nWe are working to diversify and stabilize revenues. In recent months, we have opened 15 new tenants in former anchor locations, adding more productive, higher traffic-driving uses. Also, we have another dozen committed replacements either under construction or with planning underway. We are proactively reducing our exposure to apparel retailers with more than 76% of 2019 mall leasing completed with non-apparel tenants.\nOur common and preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 2019 was as follows (in thousands, except stock prices):\nWe compute NOI based on the Operating Partnership's pro rata share of both consolidated and unconsolidated Properties. We believe that presenting NOI and same-center NOI (described below) based on our Operating Partnership's pro rata share of both consolidated and unconsolidated Properties is useful since we conduct substantially all of our business through our Operating Partnership and, therefore, it reflects the performance of the Properties in absolute terms regardless of the ratio of ownership interests of our common shareholders and the noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership. Our definition of NOI may be different than that used by other companies, and accordingly, our calculation of NOI may not be comparable to that of other companies.\nMortgages on Operating Properties\nDecember 31, 2019\n (3) An unconsolidated affiliate has an interest rate swap on a notional amount of $10,050 as of December 31, 2019 and $10,605 as of December 31, 2018 related to a variable-rate loan on Ambassador Town Center - Infrastructure Improvements to effectively fix the interest rate on this loan to a fixed-rate of 3.74%. \nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $310.9 million outstanding on our secured line of credit leaving $374.1 million of availability, after considering outstanding letters of credit of $4.8 million, as well as unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $32.8 million. Our total pro rata share of debt at December 31, 2019 was $4.3 billion. Our consolidated unencumbered properties generated approximately 27.4% of total consolidated NOI for the year ended December 31, 2019 (excluding dispositions and Excluded Malls).\nFunds from Operations\n\n \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nContractual Obligations\nIn January 2019, we entered into a new $1.185 billion senior secured credit facility, which included a fully-funded $500 million term loan and a revolving line of credit with a borrowing capacity of $685 million. The facility replaced all of the Company's prior unsecured bank facilities, which included three unsecured term loans with an aggregate balance of $695 million and three unsecured revolving lines of credit with an aggregate capacity of $1.1 billion. At closing, we utilized the line of credit to reduce the principal balance of the unsecured term loans from $695 million to $500 million. The facility matures in July 2023 and bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 2.25%. The Operating Partnership is required to pay an annual facility fee on the line of credit balance, to be paid quarterly, which ranges from 0.25% to 0.35%, based on the unused capacity of the line of credit. The principal balance on the term loan will be reduced by $35 million per year in quarterly installments. The senior secured credit facility is secured by a portfolio of the Company's Properties consisting of seventeen malls and three associated centers. The facility contains customary provisions upon which the Properties may be released from the collateral securing the Facility. The senior secured credit facility contains, among other restrictions, various restrictive covenants that are defined and computed on the same basis as the covenants required under the Notes. Such covenants relate to the Operating Partnership's and the Company's aggregate unsecured debt, aggregate secured debt, maintenance of unencumbered assets and debt service coverage. The Credit Agreement for the senior secured credit facility contains default and cross-default provisions customary for transactions of this nature (with applicable customary grace periods). Any default (i) in the payment of any recourse indebtedness greater than or equal to $50.0 million (for the Company's ownership share), or any non-recourse indebtedness greater than or equal to $150.0 million (for the Company's ownership share) or (ii) that results in the acceleration of the maturity of recourse indebtedness greater than or equal to $50.0 million (for the Company's ownership share), or any non-recourse indebtedness greater than or equal to $150.0 million (for the Company's ownership share) of the Company or the Operating Partnership will constitute an event of default under the Credit Agreement. At all times during the term of the Credit Agreement, there shall be no fewer than ten Borrowing Base Properties (as defined in the Credit Agreement) which have an aggregate occupancy rate of not less than 80% on a quarterly basis. In addition, at all times the Company shall be required to maintain a minimum debt yield of 10% for the Borrowing Base Properties based on the outstanding balance of the facility. The Credit Agreement provides that, upon the occurrence and continuation of an event of default, payment of all amounts outstanding under the facility may be accelerated and the lenders' commitments may be terminated. The Company is a limited guarantor of the Operating Partnership's obligations under the terms of the new Credit Agreement.\nCBL has no indebtedness. Either the Operating Partnership or one of its consolidated subsidiaries, that it has a direct or indirect ownership interest in, is the borrower on all of our debt.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Affiliates\nLeasing\nrevenue to the extent of the third-party partners' ownership interest. Fees to the extent of our ownership interest are recorded as a reduction to our investment in the unconsolidated affiliate.\nCBL paid a first quarter 2019 cash dividend on its common stock of $0.075 per share on April 16th. Under the terms of the settlement agreement in a class action lawsuit discussed in Item 3 of this report, we did not pay any dividends to holders of our common stock payable in the third and fourth quarters of 2019. As noted above, we suspended all future dividends on our common stock and preferred stock, as well as distributions to all noncontrolling interest investors in our Operating Partnership (as noted below). No dividends may be paid on shares of our common stock unless (i) all accrued but unpaid dividends on our preferred stock, and any current dividend then due, have been paid in cash, or a cash sum sufficient for such payment has been set apart for payment and (ii) the SCU Distribution Shortfall created by our related suspension of distributions to noncontrolling interest investors in our Operating Partnership has likewise been remedied through the payment of distributions sufficient to satisfy such shortfall for all prior periods and the then-current period (thereby allowing the resumption of distributions on the common units in the Operating Partnership that are held by the CBL, which fund our common stock dividends). We will review taxable income on a regular basis and take measures, if necessary, to ensure that we meet the minimum distribution requirements to maintain our status as a REIT.\n ( ) The balance is net of an unamortized discount of $7,527 and $8,365 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. \nReal Estate Assets\nUnconsolidated Affiliates\nShadow Development Pipeline\n\nDebt of the Operating Partnership\n\"Liquidity and Capital Resources\"\nYear Ended December 31, 2019\nCredit Ratings\nDecember 31, 2018\nRental revenues from the Comparable Properties declined primarily due to store closures and rent concessions for tenants with high occupancy cost levels, including tenants that declared bankruptcy in 2019 and 2018.\nIn 2019, we entered into four unconsolidated construction loans totaling $38.3 million. We refinanced the loan secured by one of our consolidated malls to increase the principal balance to $50.0 million and used the net proceeds from the new loan to retire the existing $41.0 million loan. W e repaid two fixed-rate consolidated loans totaling $35.5 million. In conjunction with our deconsolidation of two properties, our joint venture partner assumed $30.0 million of related debt. Lastly, we recognized a $71.7 million gain on extinguishment of debt related to two consolidated malls. See\n\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\nAverage leasing spreads for comparable space under 10,000 square feet in our stabilized malls were down 8.6% for leases signed in 2019, including a 11.5% decrease in renewal lease rates and a 9.1% increase for new leases. Average annual base rents for our same-center malls also decreased to $31.85 per square foot as of December 31, 2019 compared to $32.64 per square foot for the prior-year period.\n (1) Represents the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period divided by the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares and the weighted-average number of Operating Partnership units held by noncontrolling interests during the period. \nProperties under Development at\n ( ) A 50/50 joint venture that is accounted for using the equity method of accounting and is included in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. \nDecember 31, 2019\nFor a description of FFO and FFO, as adjusted, a reconciliation from net income attributable to common shareholders to FFO allocable to Operating\n ( ) The balance is net of an unamortized discount of $2,106 and $2,577 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. \nMall Store Sales\nsection.\nBankruptcy-related store closures impacted 2019 occupancy by approximately 398 basis points or 702,000 square feet.\n \u2022 Cash flows used in financing activities during 2019 was $296.4 million as compared to $360.4 million in the prior-year period. The reduction in our common and preferred stock dividend resulted in savings in dividends and distributions paid to common and preferred shareholders and the noncontrolling interest holders in the Operating Partnership. This was partially offset by the additional principal payments on debt and the payment of deferred financing costs, which were mostly related to our new secured credit facility. \n (3) Yield is based on the expected yield upon stabilization. \nItem 8\nDeflation can result in a decline in general price levels, often caused by a decrease in the supply of money or credit. The predominant effects of deflation are high unemployment, credit contraction and weakened consumer demand. Restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financings or refinancings for our Properties and our tenants' ability to obtain credit. Decreases in consumer demand can have a direct impact on our tenants and the rents we receive.\nWe believe that it is important to identify the impact of certain significant items on our FFO measures for a reader to have a complete understanding of our results of operations. Therefore, we have also presented adjusted FFO measures excluding these significant items from the applicable periods. Please refer to the reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders to FFO allocable to Operating Partnership common unitholders below for a description of these adjustments.\nDebt of the Company\nAs our results for 2019 and guidance for 2020 indicate, we are facing ongoing challenges, including heightened bankruptcy and store closure activity from retailers as they struggle to succeed in an increasingly competitive and fast-changing industry. Revenues and occupancy were significantly impacted by retailer bankruptcies, store closings, including the liquidation or reorganization of several major retailers, and rent reductions for tenants with high occupancy costs.\n (4) The return reflected represents a pro forma incremental return as Total Cost excludes the cost related to the acquisition of the Sears (Hamilton Place) building in 2017. \nRevenues\nThe $15.0 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of the Comparable Properties is primarily due to write-offs of tenant improvements and intangible lease assets related to store closings in the prior year period, as well as a lower basis in depreciable assets resulting from impairments recorded in 2018 and 2019.\nIn addition, $92.2 million of our pro rata share of consolidated and unconsolidated debt is related to two operating property loans, Greenbrier Mall and Hickory Point Mall, which matured in 2019. We are in discussions with the lenders regarding both loans.\n (1) The year ended December 31, 2019 is comprised of the accrued maximum expense of $88,150 recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2019 less total subsequent reductions of $26,396 pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement related to past tenants that did not submit a claim pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, tenants that opted out of the lawsuit and other permissible reductions. Litigation expense and nonrecurring professional fees expense, including settlements paid, are included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Nonrecurring professional fees reimbursement is included in interest and other income in the consolidated statements of operations. \nNote 7\nThe following table, which excludes expenditures for developments and expansions, summarizes these capital expenditures, including our share of unconsolidated affiliates' capital expenditures, for the year ended December 31, 201 compared to 201 (in thousands):\nto the consolidated financial statements for more information.\n (1 ) Weighted-average interest rate includes the effect of debt premiums and discounts, but excludes amortization of deferred financing costs. \n\nto the consolidated financial statements for more information on 2019 loan activity.\nIn 2019, we entered into four unconsolidated construction loans totaling $38.3 million. We refinanced the loan secured by one of our consolidated malls to increase the principal balance to $50.0 million and used the net proceeds from the new loan to retire the existing $41.0 million loan. Also, we exercised an option to extend the loan secured by a consolidated mall to May 2021. In conjunction with the extension, a payment of $10.8 million was made to reduce the outstanding balance of the loan to $43.0 million, of which our joint venture partner funded its 35% share.

In preparing our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\n (2) Average gross rent does not incorporate allowable future increases for recoverable CAM expenses. \nFFO does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) for purposes of evaluating our operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.\nto the consolidated financial statements for information related to our guarantees of unconsolidated affiliates' debt as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nThe reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders to FFO allocable to Operating Partnership common unitholders is as follows (in thousands):\n ( ) The balance is net of an unamortized discount of $40 and $47 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. \nIn December 2019, we announced the suspension o f all future dividends on our 7.375% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and 6.625% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock , subject to review each quarter by our Board of Directors . Unpaid dividends on the preferred stock will accrue without interest.\nGains on sales of real estate assets are recognized when it is determined that the sale has been consummated, the buyer's initial and continuing investment is adequate, our receivable, if any, is not subject to future subordination, and the buyer has assumed the usual risks and rewards of ownership of the asset. When we have an ownership interest in the buyer, gain is recognized to the extent of the third-party partner's ownership interest and the portion of the gain attributable to our ownership interest is deferred.\nMinimum rental revenue from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial terms of the related leases. Certain tenants are required to pay percentage rent if their sales volumes exceed thresholds specified in their lease agreements. Percentage rent is recognized as revenue when the thresholds are achieved and the amounts become determinable.\nof credit , the suspension of dividends on our preferred stock and common stock and proceeds from dispositions will, for the foreseeable future, provide adequate liquidity to meet our cash needs. In addition to these factors, subject to market conditions, we have options available to us to generate additional liquidity, including but not limited to, debt and equity offerings, joint venture investments, issuances of noncontrolling interests in our Operating Partnership, and decreasing expenditures related to tenant construction allowances and other capital expenditures. We also generate revenues from sales of peripheral land at our properties and from sales of real estate assets when it is determined that we can realize an optimal value for the assets.\nThe income tax provision of $3.2 million in 2019 relates to the Management Company, which is a taxable REIT subsidiary, and consists of a current tax provision of $0.5 million and a deferred tax provision of $2.7 million. The income tax benefit of $1.6 million in 2018 consists of a current tax provision of $1.3 million and a deferred tax benefit of $2.9 million.\n (3) The return reflected represents a pro forma incremental return as Total Cost excludes the cost related to the acquisition of the Sears (Cross Creek) building in 2017 \nto the consolidated financial statements for additional information about this impairment loss. No impairments of investments in unconsolidated affiliates were incurred during 2019 and 2017.\nNOI is a supplemental non-GAAP measure of the operating performance of our shopping centers and other Properties. We define NOI as property operating revenues (rental revenues, tenant reimbursements and other income) less property operating expenses (property operating, real estate taxes and maintenance and repairs).\n\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDue to the exclusions noted above, same-center NOI should only be used as a supplemental measure of our performance and not as an alternative to GAAP operating income (loss) or net income (loss). A reconciliation of our same-center NOI to net income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 201 and 201 is as follows (in thousands):\nto the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these impairments.\nDuring 2019, we recognized $61.8 million of litigation settlement expense related to the settlement of a class action lawsuit. See Note 15\n (4) NOI is derived from unencumbered Tier One Malls, as well as unencumbered portions of Tier One Malls that are otherwise secured by a loan. The unencumbered portions include outparcels, Anchors and former Anchors that have been redeveloped. \n (3) Our consolidated unencumbered properties generated approximately 27.4% of total consolidated NOI of $501,171,170 (which excludes NOI related to dispositions) for the year ended December 31, 2019. \nNote 7\n (2) Operating metrics are included for unencumbered consolidated operating properties and do not include sales or occupancy of unencumbered parcels. \n \u2022 Cash provided by investing activities during 2019 was $24.6 million, representing a $52.1 million difference as compared to cash used by investing activities of $27.5 million in the prior-year period. The cash inflow for 2019 was primarily related to a greater amount of proceeds from sales in the current year combined with lower cash paid for capital expenditures as we continue to focus on controlling such expenditures. These increases were partially offset by a lower amount of distributions from unconsolidated affiliates in 2019 as we received a distribution from an unconsolidated affiliate in 2018 related to excess proceeds from the refinancing of a mortgage loan. \n\n ( ) Represents a $43,716 non-recourse mortgage loan secured by Cary Towne Center that was classified on the consolidated balance sheet as liabilities related to assets held for sale. \nand\n (1) The debt covenant compliance ratios for the secured line of credit, the secured term loan and the senior unsecured notes are defined and computed on the same basis. \nDuring 2019, we recorded $67.2 million of gain on deconsolidation related to The Outlet Shoppes at El Paso and The Outlet Shoppes at Atlanta. See Note 7\n\nCash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities\nExecutive Overview\nsection for more information. While the industry and our Company continue to face challenges, some of which may not be in our control, we believe that the strategies in place to redevelop our Properties and diversify our tenant mix will contribute to stabilization of our portfolio and revenues in future years.\nWe had the following credit ratings as of December 31, 2019:\nInterest expense decreased $13.8 million in 2019 compared to the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily due to a $13.5 million decrease in property-level interest expense, including default interest expense, due to dispositions of encumbered properties during 2019 and a paydown in May 2019 of a portion of the loan that is secured by The Outlet Shoppes at Laredo. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $3.2 million in corporate-level interest expense due to higher variable rates on our corporate-level debt as compared to the prior-year, partially related to the higher interest rate on our new secured credit facility as compared with the previous credit facility, as well as increases in LIBOR.\n (1) Total Cost is presented net of reimbursements to be received. \n (1) Total Cost is presented net of reimbursements to be received. \nDuring 2019, we recorded $71.7 million of gain on extinguishment of debt related to two malls. We transferred Acadiana Mall to the lender in satisfaction of the non-recourse debt secured by the property. We sold Cary Towne Center and used the net proceeds from the sale to satisfy a portion of the non-recourse loan that secured the property. The remaining principal balance was forgiven.\n (2) Secured debt to total assets is required to be less than 40% for the 2026 Notes. Secured debt to total assets must be less than 45% for the 2023 Notes and the 2024 Notes until January 1, 2020, after which the required ratio was reduced to 40%. \nUnencumbered Consolidated Portfolio Statistics\n(Dollars in thousands)\nto the consolidated financial statements for more information related to the settlement.\n\nDecember 31, 2019\n (2) Represents occupancy for The Outlet Shoppes at Laredo as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. \nIn 2019 we continued to execute our strategy to transform our properties into suburban town centers, primarily through the re-tenanting of former anchor locations as well as diversification of in-line tenancy. We also significantly extended our debt maturity schedule by replacing our unsecured credit facilities and unsecured term loans with a new $1.185 billion secured facility with 16 banks that closed in January 2019, which provides us the flexibility to execute on our operational and redevelopment goals. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nCash Flows - Operating, Investing and Financing Activities\nDuring inflationary periods, substantially all of our tenant leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the impact of inflation. These provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rent based on tenants' gross sales, which generally increase as prices rise, and/or escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. In addition, many of the leases are for terms of less than ten years, which may provide us the opportunity to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base and/or percentage rent if rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate. Most of the leases require the tenants to pay a fixed amount subject to annual increases for their share of operating expenses, including CAM, real estate taxes, insurance and certain capital expenditures, which reduces our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our significant accounting policies.", "item_7_tables": "Table 256: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stabilized mall same-center sales per square foot\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stabilized mall sales per square foot\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>Table 258: <table> <tr> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td> As noted in Item 2.
