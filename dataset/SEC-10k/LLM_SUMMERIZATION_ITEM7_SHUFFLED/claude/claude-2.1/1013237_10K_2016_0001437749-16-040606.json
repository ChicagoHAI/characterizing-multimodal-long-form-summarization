We deliver insight and information to investment professionals through our analytics, service, content, and technology. By integrating comprehensive datasets and analytics across asset classes with client data, we support the workflow of both buy-side and sell-side clients. These professionals include portfolio managers, wealth managers, research and performance analysts, risk managers, sell-side equity research professionals, investment bankers and fixed income professionals. From streaming real-time data to historical information, including quotes, estimates, news and commentary, FactSet offers unique and third-party content through desktop, wireless, and off-platform solutions. Our wide application suite offers tools and resources including company and industry analyses, full screening tools, portfolio analysis, risk profiles, alpha-testing, portfolio optimization and research management solutions. Recent additions to our offering include a complete services solution focused on verifying, cleaning and loading portfolio data across asset classes, and an execution management system through our acquisition of Portware. Our revenues are derived from subscriptions to products and services such as workstations, analytics, enterprise data and content, research management and trade execution. Investment management (buy-side) clients account for 82.6% of our annual subscription value and the remainder is derived from investment banking firms (sell-side) that perform mergers and acquisitions ( M&A\u201d) advisory work, capital markets services and equity research.\n2016 Year in Review\nFiscal 2016 results continued our positive topline growth. Revenue was up 12.0% while annual subscription value ( ASV\u201d) increased 8.8% organically. This fiscal year marked our 38th year of operation, our 36th consecutive year of revenue growth and our 20th consecutive year of earnings growth as a public company. The pressures our clients have experienced in the past 12 months have not abated and we have dedicated ourselves to helping them navigate an uncertain environment. As of August 31, 2016, ASV totaled $1.15 billion, an increase of $92.0 million over the prior year. In addition, clients and users reached new highs of 3,092 and 65,655, respectively, in fiscal 2016. We returned $431.0 million to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, an increase of 33.5% over the prior year. This included $120.0 million relating to an accelerated share repurchase agreement ( ASR Agreement\u201d) which we entered into in July 2016.\nIn 2016, we sought to strengthen and expand our core business model. Our strategic acquisition of Portware in October 2015 has provided a new stream of revenue and growth. Portware revenues have grown in double-digits since the acquisition and Portware is now break-even on an earnings per share basis. Additionally, we sold our Market Metrics business in July 2016 and recognized an after-tax gain of $81.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The sale allowed us to sharpen our focus on our long-term growth drivers and our mission to deliver world-class insight and information through our analytics, service, content and technology.\nOur investment in product, coupled with the acquisition of Portware, now allows us to address an increasingly greater percentage of our clients' enterprise workflow. Our robust Portfolio Analytics solutions have been the cornerstone of our growth in the middle office. With a growing interest in passive investment instruments, such as exchange-traded funds ( ETFs\u201d), our effort to build out our ETF content and analytics product suite has made significant strides in fiscal 2016. We now have 29 ETFs in the marketplace based upon FactSet content and over 40 benchmarks. The first FactSet branded ETF, the SPDR FactSet Innovative Technology ETF, launched in January 2016.\nAs a testament to our broadening suite of premium products and the strength of our business and service model FactSet was awarded Best Overall Provider,\u201d \"Best Research Provider\" and \"Best Analytics Provider\" by Inside Market Data in May 2016,. We were also named the Best Data Analytics Provider\u201d by Waters Technology in July 2016. Other recognition included Best Research and Analytics Tool\u201d award for our wealth management tools at the annual Systems in the City Awards. Portware also earned Best Buy-side EMS\u201d for the third time and was included on Global Finance's first annual list of forex leaders, \"The Innovators 2015 - Foreign Exchange.\"\nClient Service / Consultants\nA client-centric approach has always been a key foundation of our success at FactSet. We support our powerful information and analytical applications with a team of financial data and modeling experts. Client satisfaction is a key metric by which we measure the success of our service. According to our fiscal 2016 global client satisfaction survey, 96% of respondents were satisfied or very satisfied with FactSet's support, consistent with the prior year. The depth of our knowledge, the data behind the models and the complex mathematics behind the answers each create an opportunity for us to forge close working relationships with our user community.\nOur reward for investing in a consulting group comprised of several hundred individuals is client loyalty, as evidenced by an annual client retention rate of greater than 95% of ASV as of August 31, 2016. Our consulting teams have been trained to listen to our clients' needs and transfer this knowledge directly to the product development teams, helping us transform suggestions into new or enhanced product offerings. In fiscal 2016, FactSet employees made over 45,000 client consulting visits, over 182,000 consulting calls and handled over 282,000 client questions. In addition, our new support desk in Manila, the Philippines handled over 5,000 client emails.\nEducating our clients is also an important component of our service. Not only do we teach our users the nuances of our software and content offerings, but FactSet personnel are often thought-leaders in a particular area of financial modeling in our rapidly evolving industry. As a result, clients look to FactSet as a trusted partner to stay on the cutting edge of financial modeling and analysis. During fiscal 2016, over 1,600 clients attended live or online FactSet training sessions and we saw a 7% increase in online learning registration.\nOur industry-leading customer care is largely due to the talent of our employee population. As of August 31, 2016, employee headcount was 8,375, up 13.8% from a year ago. Excluding the acquired Portware workforce and employees of the divested Market Metrics business, headcount increased 13.4% from a year ago. The increases were primarily in positions that differentiate us in the market - software engineering, client service and content. In order to optimize costs, we have invested in expanding our footprint and talent pool in India and the Philippines, where we now have a combined workforce of over 4,800. Additionally, in fiscal 2016, we opened offices in Melbourne, Australia and Los Angeles, California.\nOf our total employees, 2,407 were located in the U.S., 849 in Europe and 5,119 in Asia Pacific. Approximately 55% of our employees were involved with content collection, 24% worked in product development, software and systems engineering, another 18% conducted sales and consulting services and the remaining 3% provided administrative support. We are proud to have received the following accolades during fiscal 2016:\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Ranked #89 on Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For.\u201d The only Connecticut-based company to make the list, we were recognized for our focus on career development and providing employees a variety of opportunities and experiences to learn.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Ranked #41 on Great Place to Work\u00ae 2016 Best Workplaces in the U.K.\u201d The report highlighted our collaborative culture and marks our eighth appearance on the list.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Named as one of the 100 Best Workplaces for Women\u201d and Best Workplaces for Millennials\u201d in the U.S. by Great Place to Work\u00ae\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Named as one of the Best Workplaces in France\u201d\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey Metrics\nThe following is a review of our key metrics:\nTable 49: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> As of and for the\nYear ended August 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions, except client and user counts)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,127.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,006.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.0% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>349.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>331.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>338.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>241.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted EPS\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.71 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Free Cash Flow(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>283.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>280.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ASV\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,149.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,057.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7% </td> <td>(2) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Clients\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,092 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,976 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.9% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Users\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65,655 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62,205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.5% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities, which includes the cash cost for taxes and changes in working capital, less capital expenditures.

We use free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, both in presenting our results to stockholders and the investment community, and in our internal evaluation and management of the business. Management believes that this financial measure and the information we provide are useful to investors because they permit investors to view our performance using the same metric that we use to gauge progress in achieving our goals. Free cash flow is also an indication of cash flow that may be available to fund further investments in future growth initiatives.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> ASV grew 8.8% organically year over year. Organic ASV excludes ASV from acquisitions and dispositions completed within the last 12 months and the effects of foreign currency.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAnnual Subscription Value Growth\nAnnual subscription value at any given point in time represents the forward-looking revenues for the next twelve months from all subscription services currently being supplied to clients. With proper notice to us, our clients are able to add to, delete portions of, or terminate service at any time, subject to certain contractual limitations. ASV totaled $1.15 billion at August 31, 2016, up 8.8% organically over the prior year. Organic ASV excludes ASV from acquisitions and dispositions completed within the past 12 months and the effects of foreign currency.\nASV from our U.S. operations was $754.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, up 8.3% organically from a year ago. International ASV totaled $395.5 million, up 10.7% organically from a year ago. ASV from our international operations represented 34.4% of our Company-wide total, its highest level in FactSet history. Our European organic ASV achieved a growth rate of 8.7% over the last 12 months while Asia Pacific organic ASV grew by 17.0%. We have seen notable wins in both the sovereign wealth and investment management space and growth globally, with the addition of new clients in all three segments.\nOverall, ASV growth for our buy-side business was 9.0%, down 40 basis points from the prior year period while our sell-side business experienced 7.6% growth, down 180 basis points from the prior year period. The decrease in the buy and sell-side growth rates can be attributed to an increase in market-related cancellations.\nClient and User Additions\nAs of August 31, 2016, there were 65,655 professionals using FactSet, an increase of 3,450 users in fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2016, we added 116 net new clients, increasing the number of clients by 3.9% over the prior year. Our total client count was 3,092 as of August 31, 2016. This net number reflects a reduction of 41 clients due to the sale of the Market Metrics business. We continue to focus on expanding our current client base as it is essential to our long-term growth strategy and encourages incremental sales growth of workstations, applications and content at our existing clients.\nAnnual client retention as of August 31, 2016, was greater than 95% of ASV and 94% when expressed as a percentage of clients, consistent with the prior year, and despite market-related cancellations which impacted our ASV growth rates. Our retention success, demonstrating that a majority of our clients maintain their subscriptions to FactSet year over year, highlights the strength of our business model. August 31, 2016, our largest individual client accounted for 2% of total subscriptions, and annual subscriptions from our ten largest clients did not surpass 15% of total client subscriptions, consistent with August 31, 2015.\nReturning Value to Stockholders\nOn May 6, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a 13.6% increase in the regular quarterly dividend beginning with the dividend payment in June 2016 which was $0.50 per share, or $2.00 per share per annum. In fiscal 2016, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $232.3 million under the existing share repurchase program compared to 1.7 million shares for $252.8 million under the existing share repurchase program during fiscal 2015.\nAdditionally, in July 2016, we entered into an ASR Agreement to repurchase $120.0 million of our common stock. We received 595,607 shares of common stock on July 5, 2016 which was approximately 80% of the total number of shares of common stock expected to be repurchased under the ASR Agreement. The final settlement of the ASR Agreement occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, with FactSet receiving an additional 102,916 shares of its common stock. In conjunction with the ASR Agreement, in May 2016, our Board of Directors approved a $165.0 million expansion of the existing share repurchase program. Including the expansion, $197.0 million remained available for future share repurchases as of August 31, 2016. Combining our dividends and share repurchases, we returned $431.0 million to stockholders during fiscal 2016.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures were $47.7 million during fiscal 2016, up from $25.7 million a year ago. Approximately $27.7 million, or 58%, of our capital expenditures related to the build out of office space including $15.1 million at our New York location, $3.9 million at our Chicago location and $1.4 million at our corporate headquarters in Norwalk. The remainder of our capital expenditures was primarily for purchases of more servers for our existing data centers, additional laptop computers and peripherals for new employees, upgrades to existing computer systems and improvements to our telecommunication equipment.\nResults of Operations\nFor an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended August 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(in thousands, except per share data) </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,127,092 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,006,768 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,006,768 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>920,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of services\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>487,409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>405,339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>405,339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>353,686 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>290,007 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>269,511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>269,511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>264,430 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>349,676 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>331,918 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>331,918 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>302,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>338,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>241,051 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>241,051 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>211,543 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted earnings per common share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.71 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.71 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.92 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted weighted average common shares\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,365 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,235 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,235 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,970 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nFiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015\nRevenues in fiscal 2016 were $1,127.1 million, up 12.0% compared to fiscal 2015. Our revenue growth drivers during fiscal 2016 were robust demand for our portfolio analytics ( PA\u201d) suite of products, including an expansion of our multi-asset class value added products, accelerated growth in our Content & Technology Solutions ( CTS\u201d), advancement in Workstation Solutions and significant progress in the Portware business, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency.\nRobust Demand for Analytics\nWe saw increased demand for total portfolio risk analytics resulting in increased traction for our fixed income and multi-asset class, performance and risk offerings. In fiscal 2016, we expanded our robust offering of analytics, models, stress testing and client reporting. Our Portfolio Services offering supports our clients in integrating, cleansing and building strong analytics on top of their data. This managed service is an example of how we have broadened our sources of revenue, while responding to client needs. Clients continue to find value in our ability to serve as a single solution for their analytics, risk and publishing needs, over a variety of asset classes, which enables them to analyze securities and portfolios based on a variety of asset classes.\nAccelerated Growth in Content & Technology Solutions\nOur CTS suite of products, which provides solutions for our clients outside our terminal business, was a significant growth driver during fiscal 2016. There is an increased awareness of our CTS capabilities and data solutions to power workflows for the front and middle office. Clients are developing internal solutions to provide more customization and to help them target their customers and users more directly. Firms are coming to FactSet to integrate unique content and analytics into their client portals, customer relationship management, performance systems, quant and regulatory workflows. We license in feed form, including Fundamentals, Estimates, Transcripts and Ownership, among other offerings. The CTS suite includes a growing number of standardized data feeds that complement and mirror the data in the FactSet workstation.\nAdvancement in Workstation Solutions\nOur Workstation Solutions, including Research Management Solutions ( RMS\u201d), StreetAccount, Wealth Management and Sales & Trading, continued to be positive revenue growth drivers during fiscal 2016. RMS, which is comprised of our Internal Research Notes ( IRN\u201d) and Code Red products, provides a centralized database for collecting both internal and external research, as well as fast and efficient ways to store and retrieve notes and documents over a shared drive. Growth in our RMS suite was driven by the ongoing regulatory demand for transparency across an increasing number of workflows. Code Red, which we acquired in February 2015, has been a strong local solution supplement to our hosted IRN solution. In adding Code Red's product offering to FactSet's existing RMS, we have been able to offer an RMS for all our clients' workflows.\nSignificant progress in Portware\nPortware, acquired in October 2015, has maintained its strong track record of growth. We acquired Portware to expand our presence strategically in large global asset managers by becoming part of their trading ecosystem. Since the acquisition, Portware client volume has increased as have new client and broker connections. The integration of the Portware group into our organization has progressed smoothly. We continue to execute on the healthy pipeline of business from the close of the acquisition and have taken advantage of cross-selling the Portware solution to FactSet's client base.\nImpact of Foreign Currency\nSlightly offsetting the revenue drivers disclosed above, foreign currency movements decreased revenues by $0.1 million, or less than 10 basis points, during fiscal 2016 compared to the year ago quarter. Excluding revenues from acquisitions and dispositions completed within the last twelve months and the effects of foreign currency, our organic revenue growth rate for the quarter was 8.8%.\nFiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014\nRevenues in fiscal 2015 were $1,006.8 million, up 9.4% compared to fiscal 2014. Our revenue growth drivers during fiscal 2015 were increases in ASV, clients and users, accelerated demand for our fixed income portfolio products, portfolio analytics suite of products, sales of equity attribution and multi-asset class risk models, additional purchases of our Portfolio Services solutions, expansion of our proprietary content, and continued growth of our RMS offering.\nRevenues by Geographic Region\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years ended August 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S.\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>755,492 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>678,774 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>624,642 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Europe\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>277,682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>251,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>227,395 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asia Pacific\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93,918 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76,472 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68,298 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>371,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>327,994 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>295,693 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,127,092 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,006,768 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>920,335 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015\nRevenues from our U.S. segment increased 11.3% to $755.5 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $678.8 million a year ago. Our fiscal 2016 U.S. revenue growth rate of 11.3% reflects increases in the number of users and clients of FactSet within the U.S., predominantly at buy-side hedge fund and middle-market clients. Additionally, we recognized $21.9 million of incremental revenue from the acquisition of Portware. Revenues from our U.S. operations accounted for 67.0% of our consolidated revenues during fiscal 2016, down from 67.4% a year ago, as our international ASV growth rate surpassed our U.S. ASV growth rate by 200 basis points.\nEuropean revenues advanced 10.4% year over year which was attributable to increases in client and user counts, increased sales of PA subscriptions and incremental Portware revenues of $7.3 million, partially offset by the negative effects of foreign currency. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reduced our European growth rate by 30 basis points.\nThe Asia Pacific revenue growth rate of 22.8% was primarily due to an increase in the number of workstations, advancement in our multi-asset class risk and analytics, as well positive growth in our fee business. Portware contributed $4.1 million in sales since its acquisition in fiscal 2016. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased our Asia Pacific growth rate by 90 basis points.\nFiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014\nRevenues from our U.S. segment increased 8.7% to $678.8 million in fiscal 2015 compared to $624.6 million in fiscal 2014. Our fiscal 2015 U.S. revenue growth rate of 8.7% reflected increases in the number of users and clients of FactSet within the U.S., a rise in sales of our PA suite of products, continued demand for our proprietary content, $5.2 million of incremental revenue from the acquisition of Code Red and a strong performance by our U.S. investment management sales team. Our U.S. buy-side sales team saw sustained demand for our fixed income portfolio products, multi-asset class risk and stress testing, attribution and publishing products. Revenues from our U.S. operations accounted for 67.4% of our consolidated revenues during fiscal 2015, down from 67.9% in fiscal 2014, as our international ASV growth rate surpassed our U.S. ASV growth rate by 150 basis points.\nEuropean revenues advanced 10.6% year over year which was attributable to increases in client and user counts, continued growth in ASV from European sell-side clients and robust sales of PA subscriptions, partially offset by the negative effects of foreign currency. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reduced our European growth rate by 40 basis points.\nThe Asia Pacific revenue growth rate of 12.0% was primarily due to net new user and client growth, increased PA subscriptions and our proficiency in selling additional services to existing clients, partially offset by negative foreign currency impact attributable to the change in the value of the Japanese Yen compared to the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reduced our Asia Pacific growth rate by 350 basis points.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years ended August 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of services\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>487,409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>405,339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>353,686 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>290,007 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>269,511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>264,430 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>777,416 </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>674,850 </td> <td>(2) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>618,116 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>349,676 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>331,918 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>302,219 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Total operating expenses in fiscal 2016 include $4.6 million related primarily to legal matters, $2.8 million from restructuring actions initiated by the Company and $1.8 million related to a change in the vesting of performance-based stock options.

Expressed as a percentage of revenues, cost of services was 43.2% in fiscal 2016, an increase of 290 basis points from a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by higher employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and computer-related expenses.\nEmployee compensation, including stock-based compensation, when expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 230 basis points in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. This increase was primarily due to new employees hired in the past year. Over the last 12 months, we have added 604 net new employees involved with content collection and 266 net new engineering and product development employees, as we continue to focus on servicing our existing client base, expanding our content and improving our applications. The increase in employee headcount includes 123 employees added from the Portware acquisition in cost of sales related roles. Amortization of acquired intangible assets, when expressed as a percentage of revenues, increased 50 basis points in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the addition of $75.5 million of intangible assets related to the acquisition of Portware. Computer-related expenses, which include depreciation, maintenance, software and other fees, increased 40 basis points when expressed as a percentage of revenues, as we require additional computer hardware and peripherals for new employees, upgrades to existing computer systems and the development of new internal systems to support our growing infrastructure.\nFiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014\nCost of services increased 14.6% to $405.3 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. Expressed as a percentage of revenues, cost of services was 40.3% in fiscal 2015, an increase of 190 basis points from fiscal 2014. The increase was driven by higher employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, partially offset by lower computer depreciation.\nEmployee compensation, including stock-based compensation, when expressed as a percentage of revenues, increased 210 basis points during fiscal 2015 due to new classes of consultants, engineers and product developers hired in fiscal 2015, new additions at our proprietary content collection locations, the addition of 32 employees from the Code Red acquisition, an increase in variable compensation and annual base salary increases. In fiscal 2015, we added 344 net new employees involved with content collection, 252 net new engineering and product development employees and 124 net new consultants. In addition, of the total incremental $6.2 million expense recorded in fiscal 2015 from the vesting of performance-based equity instruments and changes in the senior leadership responsible for the Company's salesforce, $2.4 million was reported within cost of services. Expenses associated with the operation of the Code Red business increased cost of services by $3.5 million during fiscal 2015 due to compensation paid to the acquired workforce, including stock-based compensation from equity based awards granted, amortization of acquired intangible assets and computer-related expenses.\nPartially offsetting the growth in cost of services during fiscal 2015 was a reduction in computer depreciation expense, which decreased 20 basis points in fiscal 2015 compared fiscal 2014. This decrease was primarily due to the continued use of fully depreciated equipment and our transition to more efficient and cost-effective servers in our data centers.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nFiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015\nSG&A expenses increased 7.6% to $290.0 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $269.5 million in fiscal 2015. Expressed as a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses decreased 110 basis points to 25.7% in fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower employee compensation and lower occupancy costs, which include depreciation of furniture and fixtures, partially offset by expenses related to non-recurring legal matters and higher marketing costs.\nEmployee compensation, including stock-based compensation, when expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased 150 basis points from a year ago due to a higher percentage of our employee base working in a cost of services capacity compared to an SG&A role. Of our total employee headcount increase in the last 12 months, only 14% were in SG&A related roles, including 43 employees from the Portware acquisition. Additionally, approximately 142 employees in SG&A related roles left the Company as part of the sale of the Market Metrics business in July 2016. As such, employee compensation classified as SG&A expense declined compared to the growth in cost of services. Occupancy costs, when expressed as a percentage of revenues, decreased 20 basis points, primarily due to furniture and leasehold improvements becoming fully depreciated. The Company incurred approximately $3.3 million in non-recurring expenses in fiscal 2016 related primarily to legal matters. Marketing expenses increased $1.2 million year over year driven by incremental branding and advertising costs.\nFiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014\nSG&A expenses increased 1.9% to $269.5 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to $264.4 million in fiscal 2014. Expressed as a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses decreased 190 basis points to 26.8% in fiscal 2015 due to lower employee compensation and lower occupancy costs.\nEmployee compensation, including stock-based compensation, when expressed as a percentage of revenues, decreased 130 basis points due to a higher percentage of our employee base working in a cost of services capacity versus SG&A. Of our total employee headcount increase in fiscal 2015, 84% was within our software engineering, content collection and product development teams, which are all included within cost of services. As such, SG&A employee compensation declined compared to the growth in cost of services. Occupancy costs, when expressed as a percentage of revenues, decreased 60 basis points, primarily due to furniture and leasehold improvements becoming fully depreciated, lower rent expense from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the timing of acquiring new real estate space. However, certain occupancy costs, such as rent, are temporary and are being driven by the timing of acquiring new space to support our growing employee population.\nOperating Income and Operating Margin\nFiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015\nOperating income increased 5.4% to $349.7 million in fiscal year 2016 compared to the prior year. Our operating margin for fiscal 2016 was 31.0%, down from 33.0% a year ago. The lower operating margin was primarily due to Portware's operations, which reduced our operating margin by 120 basis points in fiscal 2016. Additionally, higher employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, reduced our operating margin collectively by 90 basis points. In fiscal 2016, we also incurred non-recurring charges of approximately $4.6 million related primarily to legal matters. Offsetting these drivers was organic revenue growth of 9.9% and lower occupancy costs.\nFiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014\nOperating income increased 9.8% to $331.9 million in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. Our operating margin for fiscal 2015 was 33.0%, up from 32.8% in fiscal 2014. Operating margin in fiscal 2015 was negatively impacted by a $3.2 million pre-tax charge related to changes in the senior leadership of our sales teams and a $3.0 million pre-tax charge primarily related to the vesting of performance-based equity instruments. Operating income in fiscal 2014 included $3.0 million of pre-tax charges related to vesting of performance-based equity instruments and the settlement of a legal claim. Excluding these charges, our fiscal 2015 adjusted operating margin was 33.6% compared to the fiscal 2014 adjusted operating margin of 33.2%. Revenue growth of 9.4% and net foreign currency benefits totaling of $11.2 million aided our current year operating margin expansion.\nOperating Income by Segment\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years ended August 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S.\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>165,251 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>172,980 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>165,004 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Europe\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>131,410 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>116,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100,937 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asia Pacific\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,628 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,278 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>349,676 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>331,918 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>302,219 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur operating segments are aligned with how we manage the business and the demographic markets in which we serve. Our internal financial reporting structure is based on three reportable segments, the U.S., Europe and Asia Pacific. This structure helps us better manage the business and view the markets we serve. Sales, consulting, data collection, product development and software engineering are the primary functional groups within each segment. Each segment records compensation expense, including stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of furniture and fixtures, amortization of leasehold improvements, communication costs, professional fees, rent expense, travel, marketing, office and other direct expenses. Expenditures associated with our data centers, third party data costs and corporate headquarters charges are recorded by the U.S. segment and are not allocated to the other segments. The content collection centers located in India and the Philippines benefit all of our segments, so the expenses incurred at these locations are allocated to each segment based on a percentage of revenues.\nFiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015\nU.S. operating income decreased 4.5% to $165.3 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $173.0 million a year ago. The decrease in U.S. operating income is attributed to employee compensation growth, non-recurring charges of $4.4 million and $8.3 million of incremental amortization expense from Portware, partially offset by revenue growth of 11.3%. Employee compensation increased primarily due to a 7.6% increase in the U.S. employee headcount year over year. The non-recurring charges were related primarily to legal matters.\nEuropean operating income increased 13.0% to $131.4 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $116.3 million a year ago. The increase in European operating income was due to revenue growth of 10.4% and benefits from a stronger U.S. dollar. The impact of foreign currency increased European operating income by $5.1 million year over year.\nAsia Pacific operating income increased 24.4% to $53.0 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $42.6 million a year ago. The increase in Asia Pacific operating income was due to revenue growth of 22.8% and benefits from a stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by increases in employee compensation. The impact of foreign currency increased Asia Pacific operating income by $6.5 million year over year. Employee compensation increased due to a 19.3% increase in the Asia Pacific employee headcount year over year.\nFiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014\nOperating income from our U.S. business advanced 4.8% to $173.0 million during fiscal 2015 compared to $165.0 million in fiscal 2014. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to $54.1 million of incremental revenues and a decrease in computer depreciation, partially offset by a rise in employee compensation expense. U.S. revenue growth was driven by increases in the number of users and clients of FactSet within the U.S., a rise in sales of our PA suite of products, continued demand for our proprietary content, $5.2 million of incremental revenue from the acquisition of Code Red and a strong performance by our U.S. investment management sales team. Excluding the acquired Code Red workforce, U.S. employee headcount increased 7.0% over fiscal 2014, leading to higher employee compensation costs during fiscal 2015. Computer-related expenses decreased due to the transition to more efficient and cost-effective servers in our data centers in addition to the continued use of fully depreciated servers.\nEuropean operating income increased 15.2% during fiscal 2015 to $116.3 million due to revenue growth of 10.6% and the effects of favorable foreign currency fluctuations on our expense base, partially offset by increases in employee compensation, third-party data costs and occupancy expenses. The higher employee compensation costs were due to a 17.5% increase in headcount over fiscal 2014. The increase in occupancy costs, which includes rent expense, was due to an increase in leased space in London. Finally, the increased third-party data costs were due to the increased number of users year over year.\nAsia Pacific operating income increased 17.5% to $42.6 million compared to $36.3 million in fiscal 2014. The increase was due to incremental revenues of $8.2 million and the effects of favorable foreign currency fluctuations on our expense base, partially offset by higher employee compensation. The higher employee compensation costs were due an 11.0% increase in headcount from fiscal 2014.\nIncome Taxes, Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years ended August 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>122,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92,703 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91,921 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>338,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>241,051 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>211,543 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted earnings per common share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.71 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.92 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nFiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015\nThe fiscal 2016 provision for income taxes was $122.2 million, up 31.8% from the same period a year ago. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company recognized tax expense of $30.8 million related to the gain on sale of the Company's Market Metrics business. Excluding tax expense from the gain, the provision for income taxes was $91.4 million in fiscal 2016, a decrease of 1.4% from fiscal 2015, primarily due to income tax benefits from the permanent reenactment of the U.S. Federal R&D Tax Credit in December 2015, finalizing prior year tax returns and other discrete items. Overall, we recognized income tax benefits of $10.5 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $6.5 million in the same period in fiscal 2015. Offsetting the tax benefits and excluding the gain on sale was an increase in taxable income of $14.8 million.\nFiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014\nThe fiscal 2015 provision for income taxes was $92.7 million, up from $91.9 million in fiscal 2014. The 0.9% increase was due to a 10.0% increase in pre-tax income offset by the reenactment of the U.S. Federal R&D tax credit in December 2014. The reenactment of the credit was retroactive to January 1, 2014 and extended through the end of the 2014 calendar year. The reenactment resulted in a discrete income tax benefit of $5.1 million during fiscal 2015. Additionally, we recognized tax benefits of $3.7 million related to finalizing prior year tax returns and other discrete tax items.\nNet Income and Diluted Earnings per Share\nFiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015\nNet income increased 40.6% to $338.8 million and diluted earnings per share increased 43.4% to $8.19 during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. A large component of the increase in net income and diluted earnings per share during fiscal 2016 was an after-tax gain of $81.7 million related to the sale of the Market Metrics business. The gain increased diluted earnings per share by $2.01. Excluding the after-tax gain on sale, net income increased 6.7% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, while diluted EPS was $6.18. The increase year over year was primarily due to organic ASV growth of 8.8% and tax benefits of $10.5 million related to the permanent reenactment of the U.S. Federal R&D tax credit and finalizing prior years' tax returns and other discrete items. These increases were partially offset by incremental employee compensation expense due to the hiring of 1,015 net new employees (including 166 employees from acquisitions completed in the last 12 months). Additionally, Portware's operations reduced our operating margin by 120 basis points in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2016 we also incurred non-recurring charges of approximately $3.3 million, after-tax, related primarily to legal matters. During fiscal 2016, foreign currency movements increased operating income by $11.6 million compared to a benefit of $11.2 million in the same period of fiscal 2015.\nFiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014\nNet income increased 13.9% to $241.1 million and diluted earnings per share increased 16.1% to $5.71 during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. Drivers of the increase in net income and earnings per share during fiscal 2015 included revenue growth of 9.4%, income tax benefits of $8.8 million, foreign currency benefits of $4.0 million and a decrease in diluted shares outstanding of 1.7%. These net income drivers were partially offset by incremental employee compensation expense within cost of services due to the hiring of 721 net new employees in fiscal 2015 and after-tax charges of $2.2 million and $2.1 million related to changes in the senior leadership of our sales teams and the vesting of performance-based equity instruments, respectively.\nLiquidity\nThe table below, for the periods indicated, provides selected cash flow information:\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years ended August 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>331,140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>306,442 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>265,023 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital expenditures (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(47,740 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25,682 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17,743 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Free cash flow (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>283,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>280,760 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>247,280 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(158,408 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(64,877 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(70,708 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(91,002 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(187,326 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(276,729 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents at end of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>228,407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>158,914 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>116,378 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Included in net cash used in investing activities during each fiscal year reported.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities, which includes the cash cost for taxes and changes in working capital, less capital expenditures.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015\nCash and cash equivalents aggregated to $228.4 million, or 22.4% of our total assets at August 31, 2016, compared with $158.9 million, or 21.6% of our total assets at August 31, 2015. Our cash and cash equivalents increased $69.5 million during fiscal 2016 due to cash provided by operations of $331.1 million, $153.1 million in proceeds from the sale of the Company's Market Metrics business, $56.9 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, $265.0 million in proceeds from long-term debt and $18.2 million in tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements. These cash inflows were partially offset by $262.9 million in cash paid to acquire Portware, $356.8 million in share repurchases, dividend payments of $74.2 million, capital expenditures of $47.7 million and purchases of investments, net of proceeds, of $0.9 million.\nFree cash flow for fiscal 2016 was $283.4 million. Free cash flow generated during fiscal 2016 was attributable to $338.8 million of net income, including an after-tax gain on sale of $81.7 million, $50.6 million of positive working capital changes and $58.3 million in non-cash expenses less $47.7 million in capital expenditures. Free cash flow generated in the last twelve months was up $2.6 million from the comparable year ago period due to higher levels of net income and the timing of payables and accrued compensation, offset by incremental capital expenditures.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $158.4 million in fiscal 2016, representing a $93.5 million increase from fiscal 2015. This increase was primarily due to our acquisition of Portware in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 which resulted in a net cash outflow of $262.9 million compared to a net cash outflow of $34.8 million for acquisitions occurring in fiscal 2015. Additionally, cash used in investing activities increased year over year due to an increase in capital expenditures, primarily due to the fit-out of new space in New York, Chicago and the expansion of our corporate headquarters in Norwalk. These cash outflows were partially offset by net proceeds of $153.1 million from the sale of our Market Metrics business and an increase in proceeds from the sales of investments (net of purchases) of $3.5 million year over year.\nDuring fiscal 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $91.0 million compared to $187.3 million in fiscal 2015. The year over year decrease in cash used was primarily due to proceeds from long-term debt of $265.0 million, offset by an increase in cash used in share repurchases of $100.6 million, lower proceeds and tax benefits from stock options exercised of $25.4 million, and an increase in payments of regular quarterly dividends of $7.7 million. The proceeds from long-term debt related to additional borrowings under the Second Amendment (defined in Capital Needs) to our credit agreement dated February 6, 2015 (the Credit Agreement\u201d) used to fund our acquisition of Portware on October 16, 2015. Cash used in share repurchases increased year over year as we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $232.3 million under the existing share repurchase program and 0.6 million shares for $120.0 million related to the ASR Agreement entered into in July 2016. We repurchased 1.7 million shares for $252.8 million in fiscal 2015 under the existing share repurchase program. Dividend payments increased as our Board of Directors approved a 13.6% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share, or $2.00 per share per annum, beginning with the dividend payment in June 2016.\nWe expect that for at least the next 12 months, our operating expenses will continue to constitute a significant use of our cash. As of August 31, 2016, our total cash and cash equivalents worldwide was $228.4 million, with $300.0 million in outstanding borrowings. Approximately $28.8 million of our total available cash and cash equivalents is held in bank accounts located within the U.S., $161.9 million in Europe (predominantly within the UK and France) and the remaining $37.7 million is held in the Asia Pacific region. As of August 31, 2016, we believe our liquidity (including cash on hand, cash from operating activities and other cash flows that we expect to generate) within each geographic segment will be sufficient to meet our short-term and long-term operating requirements, as they occur, including working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend payments, stock repurchases, growth objectives and other financing activities. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nFiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014\nCash and cash equivalents aggregated to $158.9 million or 21.6% of our total assets at August 31, 2015, compared with $116.4 million or 17.5% of our total assets August 31, 2014. Our cash and cash equivalents increased $42.5 million during fiscal 2015 due to cash provided by operations of $306.4 million, $71.5 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, $35.0 million in proceeds from long-term debt and $28.9 million in tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements. These cash inflows were partially offset by $34.8 million in cash paid to acquire businesses, $252.8 million in share repurchases, dividend payments of $66.6 million, capital expenditures of $25.7 million and purchases of investments, net of proceeds, of $4.4 million.\nFree cash flow for fiscal 2015 was $280.8 million, exceeding net income by 16%. Free cash flow generated during fiscal 2015 was attributable to $241.1 million of net income, $37.6 million of positive working capital changes and $27.8 million in non-cash expenses less $25.7 million in capital expenditures. Working capital improvements were derived from lower income tax payments and increased accounts payable and accrued expenses due to the timing of payments partially offset by a rise in accounts receivable compared to the prior year. The rise in accounts receivable was due to our year over year revenue growth. Our accounts receivable balance as of August 31, 2015, rose by only 5.2% compared with August 31, 2014, while revenue growth grew by 9.4% year over year. This lesser percentage increase was primarily due to a decrease in our days sales outstanding ( DSO\u201d), which declined to 33 days as of August 31, 2015, compared to 34 days as of August 31, 2014.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $64.9 million during fiscal 2015, a decrease of $5.8 million over fiscal 2014 due to a $12.1 million decrease in cash used in business acquisitions and a $1.7 million increase in proceeds from sales of short-term investments, net of purchases, partially offset by a $7.9 million increase in cash used for capital expenditures.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $187.3 million during fiscal 2015. Of this total, $252.8 million related to the repurchase of 1.7 million shares under the existing share repurchase program and $66.6 million was for the payment of regular quarterly dividends. Partially offsetting these uses of cash were proceeds received from employee stock plans totaling $71.5 million, related tax benefits of $28.9 million and long-term debt of $35.0 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $89.4 million lower in the current year due to a $36.3 million increase in proceeds from employee stock option exercises and its related income tax benefits, proceeds from long-term debt of $35.0 million and a decrease in share repurchases of $23.6 million. These positive cash movements were partially offset by an incremental $5.5 million in dividend payments due to the 12.8% increase in our regular quarterly dividend, beginning in May 2015.\nCapital Resources\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures were $47.7 million during fiscal 2016, up from $25.7 million a year ago. Approximately $27.7 million, or 58%, of our capital expenditures related to the build out of office space including $15.1 million at our New York location, $3.9 million at our Chicago location and $1.4 million at our corporate headquarters in Norwalk. The remainder of our capital expenditures was primarily for purchases of more servers for our existing data centers, additional laptop computers and peripherals for new employees, upgrades to existing computer systems and improvements to our telecommunication equipment.\nCapital expenditures were $25.7 million during fiscal 2015, up from $17.7 million in fiscal 2014. Approximately $13.8 million, or 54%, of our capital expenditures during fiscal 2015 were for purchase of computer equipment, including more servers for our existing data centers, purchasing laptop computers and peripherals for employees, upgrading existing computer systems and improving telecommunication equipment. The remaining 46% of our capital expenditures were used to build out our offices primarily in New York, Texas and the Philippines during fiscal 2015.\nCapital Needs\nLong-Term Debt\nOn February 6, 2015, we entered into a Credit Agreement between FactSet, as the borrower, and Bank of America, N.A., as the lender (the Lender\u201d). At that date, the Credit Agreement provided for a $35.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), under which we could request borrowings. The Credit Agreement also allowed us to arrange for additional borrowings for an aggregate amount of up to $265.0 million, provided that any such request for additional borrowings was in a minimum amount of $25.0 million.\nFor purposes of funding our acquisition of Code Red on February 6, 2015, we borrowed $35.0 million in the form of a Eurodollar rate loan (the Loan\u201d) under the Revolving Credit Facility. The proceeds of the Loan made under the Credit Agreement could be used for permitted acquisitions and general corporate purposes. On September 21, 2015, we amended the Credit Agreement to borrow an additional $265.0 million (the Second Amendment\u201d) in order to fund our acquisition of Portware, which closed on October 16, 2015. The maturity date on all outstanding loan amounts (which totaled $300.0 million as of August 31, 2016) is September 21, 2018. The Second Amendment also allows us, subject to certain requirements, to arrange for additional borrowings with the Lender for an aggregate amount of up to $400.0 million, provided that any such request for additional borrowings must be in a minimum amount of $25.0 million. On October 26, 2016, we borrowed an additional $65.0 million for general corporate purposes.\nThe $300.0 million borrowed under the Credit Agreement bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to the Eurodollar rate plus 0.75% and is reported as Long-term debt within the Consolidated Balance Sheet at August 31, 2016. The Eurodollar rate is defined in the Credit Agreement as the rate per annum equal to one-month LIBOR. Interest on the Loan is payable quarterly in arrears and on the maturity date. During fiscal 2016 and 2015, we paid approximately $3.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively, in interest on our outstanding Loan amount. The principal balance is payable in full on the maturity date.\nAs of August 31, 2016, we owed no commitment fees since we borrowed the full amount of the Credit Agreement. Other fees incurred, such as legal costs to draft and review the Credit Agreement, totaled less than $0.1 million and were capitalized as loan origination fees. These loan origination fees are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Loan (three years) using the effective interest method. The Credit Agreement contains covenants restricting certain FactSet activities, which are usual and customary for this type of loan.\nIn addition, the Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio, as measured by total funded debt/EBITDA, below a specified level as of the end of each fiscal quarter. We were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Credit Agreement as of August 31, 2016.\nAs of August 31, 2016, the fair value of our long-term debt was $300.0 million, which we believe approximates the carrying amount as the terms and interest rates approximate market rates given its floating interest rate basis.\nLetters of Credit\nFrom time to time, we are required to obtain letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. Approximately $1.0 million of standby letters of credit have been issued in connection with various current leased office spaces as of August 31, 2016. These standby letters of credit contain covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain minimum levels of consolidated net worth and certain leverage and fixed charge ratios. As of August 31, 2016 and 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the standby letters of credit.\nForeign Currency\nForeign Currency Exposure\nCertain wholly owned subsidiaries within the European and Asia Pacific segments operate under a functional currency different from the U.S. dollar. The financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses. Translation gains and losses that arise from translating assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders' equity.\nAs of August 31, 2016, our non-U.S. dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized over the next 12 months were estimated to be $20.0 million while our non-U.S. dollar denominated expenses were estimated to be $213.3 million, which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of $193.3 million. Our foreign currency exchange exposure is related to our operating expense base in countries outside the U.S., where 71% of our employees were located as of August 31, 2016. During fiscal 2016, foreign currency movements decreased operating income by $11.6 million, compared to $11.2 million a year ago.\nForeign Currency Hedges\nAs of August 31, 2016, we maintained the following foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure:\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> British Pound Sterling - foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 50% of our British Pound Sterling exposure through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Indian Rupee - foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 75% of our Indian Rupee exposure through the first quarter of fiscal 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of August 31, 2016, the gross notional value of foreign currency forward contracts to purchase British Pound Sterling with U.S. dollars was \u00a323.1 million. The gross notional value of foreign currency forward contracts to purchase Indian Rupees with U.S. dollars was Rs. 4.2 billion.\nThere were no other outstanding foreign currency forward contracts as of August 31, 2016. A loss on derivatives of $0.5 million was recorded into operating income during fiscal 2016, compared to a loss of $0.6 million in fiscal 2015.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt August 31, 2016 and 2015, we had no off-balance sheet financing or other arrangements with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships (such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities) established for purposes of facilitating off-balance sheet financing or other debt arrangements or for other contractually limited purposes.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn fiscal 2016, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $232.3 million under the existing share repurchase program compared to 1.7 million shares for $252.8 million under the existing share repurchase program during fiscal 2015. In July 2016, we entered into an ASR Agreement to repurchase $120.0 million of our common stock. We received 595,607 shares of common stock on July 5, 2016, which was approximately 80% of the total number of shares of common stock expected to be repurchased under the ASR Agreement. The final settlement of the ASR Agreement occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with FactSet receiving an additional 102,916 shares of its common stock. In conjunction with the ASR Agreement, in May 2016, our Board of Directors approved a $165.0 million expansion of the existing share repurchase program. Including the expansion, $197.0 million remained available for future share repurchases as of August 31, 2016.\nContractual Obligations\nFluctuations in our operating results, the degree of success of our accounts receivable collection efforts, the timing of tax and other payments as well as necessary capital expenditures to support growth of our operations will impact our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. The effect of our contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be considered in conjunction with the factors mentioned here.\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of August 31, 2016 and the corresponding effect that these obligations will have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payments due by period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018-2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020-2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2022 and thereafter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>148.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>286.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase commitments(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan outstanding(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>300.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>300.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations by period(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>93.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>367.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>148.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>653.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Operating lease amounts include future minimum lease payments under all our non-cancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year.

For the purpose of this tabular disclosure, purchase obligations for goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. It is expected that all the contractual obligations noted in the table will be funded from existing cash and cash flows from operations. Expected timing pertaining to the contractual obligations included in the table above has been estimated based on information currently available. The amounts paid and the timing of those payments may differ based on when the goods and services provided by our vendors to whom we are contractually obligated are actually received as well as due to changes to agreed-upon amounts for any of our obligations.\nAs disclosed earlier in the Capital Resources section of this MD&A, we borrowed $35.0 million in the form of a Eurodollar rate loan to fund the acquisition of Code Red in February 2015, and $265.0 million in the form of a Eurodollar rate loan to fund the acquisition of Portware in October 2015. The maturity date on all outstanding loan amounts is September 21, 2018, and there are no prepayment penalties in the event that we elect to prepay the loan prior to its scheduled maturity date. The amount borrowed bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to the Eurodollar rate plus 0.75% and is reported as Long-term debt within our Consolidated Balance Sheet at August 31, 2016.\nDividends\nOn May 6, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a 13.6% increase in the regular quarterly dividend beginning with the dividend payment in June 2016 which was $0.50 per share, or $2.00 per share per annum. With our dividends and our share repurchases, in the aggregate, we have returned $431.0 million to shareholders over the past 12 months. Future cash dividends will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors we considered relevant and is subject to final determination by our Board of Directors.\nDuring fiscal years 2016 and 2015, our Board of Directors declared the following dividends:\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td> Declaration Date\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Dividends Per\nShare of\nCommon Stock\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Type\n</td> <td> Record Date\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total $ Amount\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Payment Date\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> August 5, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.50 </td> <td> </td> <td> Regular (cash)\n</td> <td> August 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,019 </td> <td> </td> <td> September 20, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> May 6, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.50 </td> <td> </td> <td> Regular (cash)\n</td> <td> May 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,171 </td> <td> </td> <td> June 21, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> February 5, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.44 </td> <td> </td> <td> Regular (cash)\n</td> <td> February 29, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,044 </td> <td> </td> <td> March 15, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> November 6, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.44 </td> <td> </td> <td> Regular (cash)\n</td> <td> November 30, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,208 </td> <td> </td> <td> December 15, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> August 10, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.44 </td> <td> </td> <td> Regular (cash)\n</td> <td> August 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,179 </td> <td> </td> <td> September 15, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> May 12, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.44 </td> <td> </td> <td> Regular (cash)\n</td> <td> May 29, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,274 </td> <td> </td> <td> June 16, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> February 11, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.39 </td> <td> </td> <td> Regular (cash)\n</td> <td> February 27, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,236 </td> <td> </td> <td> March 17, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> November 12, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.39 </td> <td> </td> <td> Regular (cash)\n</td> <td> November 28, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,216 </td> <td> </td> <td> December 16, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAll of the above cash dividends were paid from existing cash resources. Future cash dividends will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors we considered relevant and is subject to final determination by our Board of Directors.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nWe describe our significant accounting policies in Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 below.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. In addition, there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. All of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies and contingent consideration are recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date. The application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. Our estimates are based on historical experience, information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and when appropriate, includes assistance from independent third party appraisal firms. Our significant assumptions and estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates.\nPerformance-based Equity Awards\nWe have an employee stock-based compensation plan, which allows for the issuance of performance-based equity awards to employees. Accounting guidance requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all performance-based equity awards made to employees based on the estimated fair values of the awards that are expected to vest. At the end of each reporting period, management must make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving our performance targets because the number of stock options that vest will be predicated on us achieving these levels. However, there is no current guarantee that such options will vest in whole or in part.\nJuly 2012 Performance-based Option Grant Review\nIn July 2012, we granted 241,546 performance-based employee stock options, which are eligible to vest in 20% tranches depending upon future StreetAccount user growth through August 31, 2017. Through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, four of the growth targets as outlined within the terms of the grant were achieved. As such, 80%, or 193,256, of the options granted have vested. As of August 31, 2016, the fifth tranche is expected to vest on August 31, 2017, resulting in unamortized stock-based compensation expense of $0.3 million to be recognized over the remaining vesting period of 1.0 year. A change in the actual financial performance levels achieved by StreetAccount in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense:\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> Vesting Percentage (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Cumulative\nCatch-up Adjustment*\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Remaining Expense\nto be Recognized\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fifth 20% (current expectation)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,290 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>310 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Amounts represent the cumulative catch-up adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of August 31, 2016.\nFebruary 2015 Performance-based Option Grant Review\nIn connection with the acquisition of Code Red during the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we granted 137,522 performance-based stock options. These performance-based options are eligible to vest four years from date of grant if certain Code Red ASV and operating margin targets are achieved over the measurement period. The option holders must also remain employed by FactSet for the options to be eligible to vest.\nOf the total grant, 68,761 performance-based options are eligible for vesting based on achieving the growth targets over a two year measurement period ending February 28, 2017. As of August 31, 2016, total unamortized stock-based compensation of $1.3 million will be recognized as expense over the remaining vesting period of 2.4 years. A change, up or down, in the actual financial performance levels achieved by Code Red in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense:\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> Vesting Percentage (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Cumulative\nCatch-up Adjustment*\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Remaining Expense\nto be Recognized\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>0% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(820 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>10% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(704 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>183 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>40% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(352 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>732 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 70% (current expectation)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,281 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>352 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,828 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Amounts represent the cumulative catch-up adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of August 31, 2016.\nThe remaining 68,761 options are eligible to cliff vest based on a four-year measurement period ending February 28, 2019. As of August 31, 2016, total unamortized stock-based compensation of $0.7 million will be recognized as expense over the remaining vesting period of 2.4 years. A change, up or down, in the actual financial performance levels achieved by Code Red in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense:\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td> Vesting Percentage (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Cumulative\nCatch-up Adjustment*\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Remaining Expense\nto be Recognized\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 0%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(469 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 10%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(352 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>183 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 40% (current expectation)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>732 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 70%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>352 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,281 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 100%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>704 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,828 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Amounts represent the cumulative catch-up adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of August 31, 2016.\nOctober 2015 and August 2016 Performance-based Option Grant Review\nIn connection with the acquisition of Portware during the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we granted 530,418 performance-based stock options. These performance-based options will vest 40% on the second anniversary date of the grant and 20% on each subsequent anniversary date if certain Portware revenue and operating income targets are achieved by October 16, 2017. The option holders must also remain employed by FactSet for the options to be eligible to vest. As of August 31, 2016, we do not believe these growth targets are probable of being achieved, and as such, no stock-based compensation expense is expected to be recognized in connection with these performance-based options. A change in the actual financial performance levels achieved by Portware in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense:\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> Vesting Percentage (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Cumulative\nCatch-up Adjustment*\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Remaining Expense\nto be Recognized\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 0% (current expectation)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 50%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,144 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,106 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 70%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,002 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,148 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 100%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,288 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,212 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Amounts represent the cumulative catch-up adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of August 31, 2016.\nWe granted 20,911 additional performance-based stock options to Portware employees in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Similar to the October 2015 grant, these performance-based options will vest 40% on the second anniversary date of the grant and 20% on each subsequent anniversary date if certain Portware revenue and operating income targets are achieved by October 16, 2017. The option holders must also remain employed by FactSet for the options to be eligible to vest. As of August 31, 2016, we do not believe these growth targets are probable of being achieved, and as such, no stock-based compensation expense is expected to be recognized in connection with these performance-based options. A change in the actual financial performance levels achieved by Portware in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense:\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td> Vesting Percentage (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Cumulative\nCatch-up Adjustment*\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Remaining Expense\nto be Recognized\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 0% (current expectation)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 50%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>492 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 70%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>688 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 100%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>984 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Amounts represent the cumulative catch-up adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of August 31, 2016.\nAccrued Compensation\nWe make significant estimates in determining our accrued compensation. Approximately 15% of our total employee compensation is variable and discretionary. We conduct a final review of Company and departmental individual performance each year end to determine the amount of discretionary employee compensation. We also review compensation throughout the year to determine how overall performance tracks against management's expectations. Management takes these and other factors, including historical performance, into account in reviewing accrued compensation estimates on a quarterly basis and adjusts accrual rates as appropriate. As of August 31, 2016 and 2015 the amount of the variable employee compensation recorded within accrued compensation was $38.2 million and $38.6 million, respectively.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is not amortized as it is estimated to have an indefinite life. At least annually, we are required to test goodwill at the reporting unit level for potential impairment, and, if impaired, write down to fair value based on the present value of discounted cash flows. Our reporting units evaluated for potential impairment were the U.S., Europe and Asia Pacific, which reflect the level of internal reporting we use to manage our business and operations. The three reporting units are consistent with the operating segments reported as there is no discrete financial information available for the subsidiaries within each operating segment. The impairment test requires management to make judgments in connection with these reporting units, including assigning assets, liabilities, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit.\nOur impairment analysis contains uncertainties as it requires management to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate industry and economic factors including market conditions, legal and technological factors and the profitability of our business strategies. It is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategies taking into consideration present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations. We have not made any material changes in our impairment analysis methodology during the past three fiscal years. While we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for goodwill impairment losses, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions. Future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment do exist and that goodwill associated with our previous acquisitions is impaired, which could result in an impairment loss in our Consolidated Statements of Income and a write-down of the related asset.\nWe performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, consistent with previous years, at which time it was determined that there were no indications of impairment, with the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units significantly exceeding carrying value. The carrying value of goodwill as of August 31, 2016 and 2015, was $452.9 million and $308.3 million, respectively.\nOur identifiable intangible assets consist of acquired content databases, client relationships, software technology, non-compete agreements and trade names resulting from acquisitions, which have been fully integrated into our operations. Depending on the nature of the intangible asset, it is amortized on either a straight-line or an accelerated basis using estimated useful lives ranging from two to twenty years. These useful lives are evaluated quarterly to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. If the estimate of the remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. There were no adjustments to the useful lives of intangible assets subject to amortization during any of the periods presented. These intangible assets have no assigned residual values as of August 31, 2016 and 2015.\nIntangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of any impairment loss for intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. No impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented. Our ongoing consideration of the recoverability could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our results of operations. The carrying value of intangible assets as of August 31, 2016 and 2015, was $93.2 million and $40.1 million, respectively.\nLong-lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, comprised of property, equipment and leasehold improvements are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may cause an impairment review include significant changes in technology that make current computer-related assets that we use in our operations obsolete or less useful and significant changes in the way we use these assets in our operations. When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment if impairment indicators are present, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value, which may be based on estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset's carrying value exceeds the asset's estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. The new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of that asset. Using the impairment evaluation methodology described here, there have been no long-lived asset impairment charges for each of the last three years. The carrying value of long-lived assets as of August 31, 2016 and 2015, was $84.6 million and $59.3 million, respectively.\nOur impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. We have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.\nEstimated Tax Provision and Tax Contingencies\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our tax provision is an estimate based on our understanding of laws in Federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions. These laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to any business including ours. The tax laws also require us to allocate our taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of state taxes, foreign operations, R&D and other tax credits, tax audit settlements, incentive-stock options and domestic production activities deductions. Our annual effective tax rate was 26.5%, 27.8% and 30.3% in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nWe recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position as of the reporting date. Otherwise, no benefit can be recognized. The tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We will classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that we anticipate payment of cash within one year. Additionally, we accrue interest on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws. Interest is classified as income tax expense in the financial statements.\nAs of August 31, 2016, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling $8.8 million, including $1.3 million of accrued interest, recorded as Taxes Payable (non-current) within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions taken on tax returns but not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements. When applicable, we adjust the previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results when the position is effectively settled. If recognized, the unrecognized tax benefits and related interest would be recorded as a benefit to tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Audits by multiple tax authorities are currently ongoing. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. For this reason, we regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest.\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by numerous factors such as changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations of them. Significant judgment is required to determine recognition and measurement. Further, as a result of certain ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely affect our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption, which we include here by reference.\nMarket Trends\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to financial risks involving the volatility of equity markets as well as foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.\nApproximately 82.6% of our ASV is derived from our investment management clients. The prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management. An equity market decline not only depresses assets under management but could cause a significant increase in redemption requests. Moreover, extended declines in the equity markets may reduce new fund or client creation, resulting in lower demand for services from investment management clients. Our investment banking clients that perform M&A advisory work, provide capital markets services and equity research, account for approximately 17.4% of our ASV. A significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by the largest banks. Credit continues to impact many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations. Clients could encounter similar problems. A lack of confidence in the global banking system could cause declines in M&A funded by debt. Additional uncertainty, consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking sector could adversely affect our financial results and future growth. Regardless, the size of banks in general is shrinking as they deleverage their balance sheets and adjust their expense bases to future revenue opportunities. Our revenues may decline if banks, including those involved in recent merger activity, significantly reduce headcount in the areas of corporate M&A, capital markets and equity research to compensate for the issues created by other departments.\nDue to the global nature of our operations, we conduct business outside the U.S. in several currencies including the British Pound Sterling, Euro, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen and Philippine Peso. To the extent that our international activities increase in the future, our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase. To manage this exposure, we utilize derivative instruments (foreign currency forward contracts). By their nature, all derivative instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of market and credit risk. The market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. Credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposure to the counterparties associated with these instruments. Our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings associated with changes in foreign currency.\nOn June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom ( UK\u201d) held a referendum in which British citizens approved an exit from the European Union ( EU\u201d), commonly referred to as Brexit.\u201d As a result of the referendum, the global markets and currencies have been adversely impacted, including a sharp decline in the value of the British Pound Sterling as compared to the U.S. dollar. Volatility in exchange rates is expected to continue in the short term as the UK negotiates its exit from the EU. We currently hedge approximately 50% of our British Pound Sterling exposure through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, thus reducing our currency risk. In the longer term, any impact from Brexit on us will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations. Although it is unknown what the result of those negotiations will be, it is possible that new terms may adversely affect our operations and financial results. While we evaluate our own risks and uncertainty related to Brexit, we will continue to partner with our clients to help them navigate the fluctuating international markets. Our products, including our datasets such as GeoRev, allow our clients to understand geographic exposure and assess the risks of operating on a global scale so they may make informed business decisions.\nForward-Looking Factors\nForward-Looking Statements\nIn addition to current and historical information, this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements regarding future events and our future results that are based on management's current expectations, estimates, forecast and projections about the industries in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, are statements that could be deemed to be forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking statements may be identified by words like expects,\u201d anticipates,\u201d plans,\u201d intends,\u201d projects,\u201d should,\u201d indicates,\u201d continues,\u201d ASV,\u201d subscriptions,\u201d believes,\u201d estimates,\u201d may\u201d and similar expressions. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth, trends in our business and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Therefore, actual results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. We will publicly update forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events in accordance with applicable Securities and Exchange Commission regulations.\nWe intend that all forward-looking statements we make will be subject to safe harbor protection of the federal securities laws as found in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements involve certain known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements.

While we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for goodwill impairment losses, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions. Future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment do exist and that goodwill associated with our previous acquisitions is impaired, which could result in an impairment loss in our Consolidated Statements of Income and a write-down of the related asset.\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> Vesting Percentage (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Cumulative\nCatch-up Adjustment*\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Remaining Expense\nto be Recognized\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fifth 20% (current expectation)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,290 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>310 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAsia Pacific operating income increased 24.4% to $53.0 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $42.6 million a year ago. The increase in Asia Pacific operating income was due to revenue growth of 22.8% and benefits from a stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by increases in employee compensation. The impact of foreign currency increased Asia Pacific operating income by $6.5 million year over year. Employee compensation increased due to a 19.3% increase in the Asia Pacific employee headcount year over year.\n \u25cf Results of Operations \nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years ended August 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of services\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>487,409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>405,339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>353,686 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>290,007 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>269,511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>264,430 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>777,416 </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>674,850 </td> <td>(2) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>618,116 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>349,676 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>331,918 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>302,219 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of August 31, 2016, the gross notional value of foreign currency forward contracts to purchase British Pound Sterling with U.S. dollars was \u00a323.1 million.

Depending on the nature of the intangible asset, it is amortized on either a straight-line or an accelerated basis using estimated useful lives ranging from two to twenty years. These useful lives are evaluated quarterly to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. If the estimate of the remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life.

Organic ASV excludes ASV from acquisitions and dispositions completed within the past 12 months and the effects of foreign currency.\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years ended August 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>122,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92,703 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91,921 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>338,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>241,051 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>211,543 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted earnings per common share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.71 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.92 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nForward-Looking Statements\n (4) Non-current income taxes payable of $8.8 million and non-current deferred tax liabilities of $1.7 million have been excluded in the table above due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future payments. \n\nIn addition, the Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio, as measured by total funded debt/EBITDA, below a specified level as of the end of each fiscal quarter. We were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Credit Agreement as of August 31, 2016.\nDividend Payment\nAdvancement in Workstation Solutions\nRevenues by Geographic Region\n \u25cf Ranked #89 on Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For.\u201d The only Connecticut-based company to make the list, we were recognized for our focus on career development and providing employees a variety of opportunities and experiences to learn. \nU.S. operating income decreased 4.5% to $165.3 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $173.0 million a year ago. The decrease in U.S. operating income is attributed to employee compensation growth, non-recurring charges of $4.4 million and $8.3 million of incremental amortization expense from Portware, partially offset by revenue growth of 11.3%. Employee compensation increased primarily due to a 7.6% increase in the U.S. employee headcount year over year. The non-recurring charges were related primarily to legal matters.\nFluctuations in our operating results, the degree of success of our accounts receivable collection efforts, the timing of tax and other payments as well as necessary capital expenditures to support growth of our operations will impact our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. The effect of our contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be considered in conjunction with the factors mentioned here.\nOur investment in product, coupled with the acquisition of Portware, now allows us to address an increasingly greater percentage of our clients' enterprise workflow. Our robust Portfolio Analytics solutions have been the cornerstone of our growth in the middle office. With a growing interest in passive investment instruments, such as exchange-traded funds ( ETFs\u201d), our effort to build out our ETF content and analytics product suite has made significant strides in fiscal 2016. We now have 29 ETFs in the marketplace based upon FactSet content and over 40 benchmarks. The first FactSet branded ETF, the SPDR FactSet Innovative Technology ETF, launched in January 2016.\nThe MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nOur operating segments are aligned with how we manage the business and the demographic markets in which we serve. Our internal financial reporting structure is based on three reportable segments, the U.S., Europe and Asia Pacific. This structure helps us better manage the business and view the markets we serve. Sales, consulting, data collection, product development and software engineering are the primary functional groups within each segment. Each segment records compensation expense, including stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of furniture and fixtures, amortization of leasehold improvements, communication costs, professional fees, rent expense, travel, marketing, office and other direct expenses. Expenditures associated with our data centers, third party data costs and corporate headquarters charges are recorded by the U.S. segment and are not allocated to the other segments. The content collection centers located in India and the Philippines benefit all of our segments, so the expenses incurred at these locations are allocated to each segment based on a percentage of revenues.\nWe expect that for at least the next 12 months, our operating expenses will continue to constitute a significant use of our cash. As of August 31, 2016, our total cash and cash equivalents worldwide was $228.4 million, with $300.0 million in outstanding borrowings. Approximately $28.8 million of our total available cash and cash equivalents is held in bank accounts located within the U.S., $161.9 million in Europe (predominantly within the UK and France) and the remaining $37.7 million is held in the Asia Pacific region. As of August 31, 2016, we believe our liquidity (including cash on hand, cash from operating activities and other cash flows that we expect to generate) within each geographic segment will be sufficient to meet our short-term and long-term operating requirements, as they occur, including working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend payments, stock repurchases, growth objectives and other financing activities. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\n* Amounts represent the cumulative catch-up adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of August 31, 2016.\nEmployee compensation, including stock-based compensation, when expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased 150 basis points from a year ago due to a higher percentage of our employee base working in a cost of services capacity compared to an SG&A role. Of our total employee headcount increase in the last 12 months, only 14% were in SG&A related roles, including 43 employees from the Portware acquisition. Additionally, approximately 142 employees in SG&A related roles left the Company as part of the sale of the Market Metrics business in July 2016. As such, employee compensation classified as SG&A expense declined compared to the growth in cost of services. Occupancy costs, when expressed as a percentage of revenues, decreased 20 basis points, primarily due to furniture and leasehold improvements becoming fully depreciated. The Company incurred approximately $3.3 million in non-recurring expenses in fiscal 2016 related primarily to legal matters. Marketing expenses increased $1.2 million year over year driven by incremental branding and advertising costs.\nOperating income from our U.S. business advanced 4.8% to $173.0 million during fiscal 2015 compared to $165.0 million in fiscal 2014. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to $54.1 million of incremental revenues and a decrease in computer depreciation, partially offset by a rise in employee compensation expense. U.S. revenue growth was driven by increases in the number of users and clients of FactSet within the U.S., a rise in sales of our PA suite of products, continued demand for our proprietary content, $5.2 million of incremental revenue from the acquisition of Code Red and a strong performance by our U.S. investment management sales team. Excluding the acquired Code Red workforce, U.S. employee headcount increased 7.0% over fiscal 2014, leading to higher employee compensation costs during fiscal 2015. Computer-related expenses decreased due to the transition to more efficient and cost-effective servers in our data centers in addition to the continued use of fully depreciated servers.\nEmployee compensation, including stock-based compensation, when expressed as a percentage of revenues, increased 210 basis points during fiscal 2015 due to new classes of consultants, engineers and product developers hired in fiscal 2015, new additions at our proprietary content collection locations, the addition of 32 employees from the Code Red acquisition, an increase in variable compensation and annual base salary increases. In fiscal 2015, we added 344 net new employees involved with content collection, 252 net new engineering and product development employees and 124 net new consultants. In addition, of the total incremental $6.2 million expense recorded in fiscal 2015 from the vesting of performance-based equity instruments and changes in the senior leadership responsible for the Company's salesforce, $2.4 million was reported within cost of services. Expenses associated with the operation of the Code Red business increased cost of services by $3.5 million during fiscal 2015 due to compensation paid to the acquired workforce, including stock-based compensation from equity based awards granted, amortization of acquired intangible assets and computer-related expenses.\nFree cash flow for fiscal 2016 was $283.4 million. Free cash flow generated during fiscal 2016 was attributable to $338.8 million of net income, including an after-tax gain on sale of $81.7 million, $50.6 million of positive working capital changes and $58.3 million in non-cash expenses less $47.7 million in capital expenditures. Free cash flow generated in the last twelve months was up $2.6 million from the comparable year ago period due to higher levels of net income and the timing of payables and accrued compensation, offset by incremental capital expenditures.\nIn addition to current and historical information, this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements regarding future events and our future results that are based on management's current expectations, estimates, forecast and projections about the industries in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, are statements that could be deemed to be forward-looking statements. These include statements about our strategy for growth, product development, market position, subscriptions and expected expenditures and financial results. Forward-looking statements may be identified by words like expects,\u201d anticipates,\u201d plans,\u201d intends,\u201d projects,\u201d should,\u201d indicates,\u201d continues,\u201d ASV,\u201d subscriptions,\u201d believes,\u201d estimates,\u201d may\u201d and similar expressions. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth, trends in our business and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Therefore, actual results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. We will publicly update forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events in accordance with applicable Securities and Exchange Commission regulations.\nFrom time to time, we are required to obtain letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. Approximately $1.0 million of standby letters of credit have been issued in connection with various current leased office spaces as of August 31, 2016. These standby letters of credit contain covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain minimum levels of consolidated net worth and certain leverage and fixed charge ratios. As of August 31, 2016 and 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the standby letters of credit.\nCapital expenditures were $47.7 million during fiscal 2016, up from $25.7 million a year ago. Approximately $27.7 million, or 58%, of our capital expenditures related to the build out of office space including $15.1 million at our New York location, $3.9 million at our Chicago location and $1.4 million at our corporate headquarters in Norwalk. The remainder of our capital expenditures was primarily for purchases of more servers for our existing data centers, additional laptop computers and peripherals for new employees, upgrades to existing computer systems and improvements to our telecommunication equipment.\nAccelerated Growth in Content & Technology Solutions\nOperating income increased 9.8% to $331.9 million in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. Our operating margin for fiscal 2015 was 33.0%, up from 32.8% in fiscal 2014. Operating margin in fiscal 2015 was negatively impacted by a $3.2 million pre-tax charge related to changes in the senior leadership of our sales teams and a $3.0 million pre-tax charge primarily related to the vesting of performance-based equity instruments. Operating income in fiscal 2014 included $3.0 million of pre-tax charges related to vesting of performance-based equity instruments and the settlement of a legal claim. Excluding these charges, our fiscal 2015 adjusted operating margin was 33.6% compared to the fiscal 2014 adjusted operating margin of 33.2%. Revenue growth of 9.4% and net foreign currency benefits totaling of $11.2 million aided our current year operating margin expansion.\nIn July 2012, we granted 241,546 performance-based employee stock options, which are eligible to vest in 20% tranches depending upon future StreetAccount user growth through August 31, 2017. Through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, four of the growth targets as outlined within the terms of the grant were achieved. As such, 80%, or 193,256, of the options granted have vested. As of August 31, 2016, the fifth tranche is expected to vest on August 31, 2017, resulting in unamortized stock-based compensation expense of $0.3 million to be recognized over the remaining vesting period of 1.0 year. A change in the actual financial performance levels achieved by StreetAccount in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense:\nCash and cash equivalents aggregated to $228.4 million, or 22.4% of our total assets at August 31, 2016, compared with $158.9 million, or 21.6% of our total assets at August 31, 2015. Our cash and cash equivalents increased $69.5 million during fiscal 2016 due to cash provided by operations of $331.1 million, $153.1 million in proceeds from the sale of the Company's Market Metrics business, $56.9 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, $265.0 million in proceeds from long-term debt and $18.2 million in tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements. These cash inflows were partially offset by $262.9 million in cash paid to acquire Portware, $356.8 million in share repurchases, dividend payments of $74.2 million, capital expenditures of $47.7 million and purchases of investments, net of proceeds, of $0.9 million.\nIntangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of any impairment loss for intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. No impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented. Our ongoing consideration of the recoverability could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our results of operations. The carrying value of intangible assets as of August 31, 2016 and 2015, was $93.2 million and $40.1 million, respectively.\nEuropean operating income increased 15.2% during fiscal 2015 to $116.3 million due to revenue growth of 10.6% and the effects of favorable foreign currency fluctuations on our expense base, partially offset by increases in employee compensation, third-party data costs and occupancy expenses. The higher employee compensation costs were due to a 17.5% increase in headcount over fiscal 2014. The increase in occupancy costs, which includes rent expense, was due to an increase in leased space in London. Finally, the increased third-party data costs were due to the increased number of users year over year.\n (1) We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities, which includes the cash cost for taxes and changes in working capital, less capital expenditures. The presentation of free cash flow is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We use free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, both in presenting our results to stockholders and the investment community, and in our internal evaluation and management of the business. Management believes that this financial measure and the information we provide are useful to investors because they permit investors to view our performance using the same metric that we use to gauge progress in achieving our goals. Free cash flow is also an indication of cash flow that may be available to fund further investments in future growth initiatives. \nFor purposes of funding our acquisition of Code Red on February 6, 2015, we borrowed $35.0 million in the form of a Eurodollar rate loan (the Loan\u201d) under the Revolving Credit Facility. The proceeds of the Loan made under the Credit Agreement could be used for permitted acquisitions and general corporate purposes. On September 21, 2015, we amended the Credit Agreement to borrow an additional $265.0 million (the Second Amendment\u201d) in order to fund our acquisition of Portware, which closed on October 16, 2015. The maturity date on all outstanding loan amounts (which totaled $300.0 million as of August 31, 2016) is September 21, 2018. The Second Amendment also allows us, subject to certain requirements, to arrange for additional borrowings with the Lender for an aggregate amount of up to $400.0 million, provided that any such request for additional borrowings must be in a minimum amount of $25.0 million. On October 26, 2016, we borrowed an additional $65.0 million for general corporate purposes.\nExecutive Overview\n \u25cf Market Trends \nLong-lived assets, comprised of property, equipment and leasehold improvements are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may cause an impairment review include significant changes in technology that make current computer-related assets that we use in our operations obsolete or less useful and significant changes in the way we use these assets in our operations. When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment if impairment indicators are present, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value, which may be based on estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset's carrying value exceeds the asset's estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. The new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of that asset. Using the impairment evaluation methodology described here, there have been no long-lived asset impairment charges for each of the last three years. The carrying value of long-lived assets as of August 31, 2016 and 2015, was $84.6 million and $59.3 million, respectively.\nRevenues\nContractual Obligations\n (2) Purchase commitments represent payments due in future periods in respect of obligations to our various data vendors as well as commitments to purchase goods and services such as telecommunication and computer maintenance services. \nOperating Income and Operating Margin\n\nOur CTS suite of products, which provides solutions for our clients outside our terminal business, was a significant growth driver during fiscal 2016. There is an increased awareness of our CTS capabilities and data solutions to power workflows for the front and middle office. Clients are developing internal solutions to provide more customization and to help them target their customers and users more directly. Firms are coming to FactSet to integrate unique content and analytics into their client portals, customer relationship management, performance systems, quant and regulatory workflows. We license in feed form, including Fundamentals, Estimates, Transcripts and Ownership, among other offerings. The CTS suite includes a growing number of standardized data feeds that complement and mirror the data in the FactSet workstation.\n \u25cf Forward-Looking Factors \nApproximately 82.6% of our ASV is derived from our investment management clients. The prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management. An equity market decline not only depresses assets under management but could cause a significant increase in redemption requests. Moreover, extended declines in the equity markets may reduce new fund or client creation, resulting in lower demand for services from investment management clients. Our investment banking clients that perform M&A advisory work, provide capital markets services and equity research, account for approximately 17.4% of our ASV. A significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by the largest banks. Credit continues to impact many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations. Clients could encounter similar problems. A lack of confidence in the global banking system could cause declines in M&A funded by debt. Additional uncertainty, consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking sector could adversely affect our financial results and future growth. Regardless, the size of banks in general is shrinking as they deleverage their balance sheets and adjust their expense bases to future revenue opportunities. Our revenues may decline if banks, including those involved in recent merger activity, significantly reduce headcount in the areas of corporate M&A, capital markets and equity research to compensate for the issues created by other departments.\n\nFiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015\n\nPortware, acquired in October 2015, has maintained its strong track record of growth. We acquired Portware to expand our presence strategically in large global asset managers by becoming part of their trading ecosystem. Since the acquisition, Portware client volume has increased as have new client and broker connections. The integration of the Portware group into our organization has progressed smoothly. We continue to execute on the healthy pipeline of business from the close of the acquisition and have taken advantage of cross-selling the Portware solution to FactSet's client base.\n \u25cf Share Repurchase Program \nWe intend that all forward-looking statements we make will be subject to safe harbor protection of the federal securities laws as found in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements involve certain known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, those listed in Part 1 Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to update any of our forward-looking statements after the date of this Annual Report to reflect actual results or future events or circumstances.\nThe remaining 68,761 options are eligible to cliff vest based on a four-year measurement period ending February 28, 2019. As of August 31, 2016, total unamortized stock-based compensation of $0.7 million will be recognized as expense over the remaining vesting period of 2.4 years. A change, up or down, in the actual financial performance levels achieved by Code Red in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense:\n* Amounts represent the cumulative catch-up adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of August 31, 2016.\nCapital expenditures were $25.7 million during fiscal 2015, up from $17.7 million in fiscal 2014. Approximately $13.8 million, or 54%, of our capital expenditures during fiscal 2015 were for purchase of computer equipment, including more servers for our existing data centers, purchasing laptop computers and peripherals for employees, upgrading existing computer systems and improving telecommunication equipment. The remaining 46% of our capital expenditures were used to build out our offices primarily in New York, Texas and the Philippines during fiscal 2015.\nFree cash flow for fiscal 2015 was $280.8 million, exceeding net income by 16%. Free cash flow generated during fiscal 2015 was attributable to $241.1 million of net income, $37.6 million of positive working capital changes and $27.8 million in non-cash expenses less $25.7 million in capital expenditures. Working capital improvements were derived from lower income tax payments and increased accounts payable and accrued expenses due to the timing of payments partially offset by a rise in accounts receivable compared to the prior year. The rise in accounts receivable was due to our year over year revenue growth. Our accounts receivable balance as of August 31, 2015, rose by only 5.2% compared with August 31, 2014, while revenue growth grew by 9.4% year over year. This lesser percentage increase was primarily due to a decrease in our days sales outstanding ( DSO\u201d), which declined to 33 days as of August 31, 2015, compared to 34 days as of August 31, 2014.\n \u25cf Significant Accounting Policies \nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our tax provision is an estimate based on our understanding of laws in Federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions. These laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to any business including ours. The tax laws also require us to allocate our taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of state taxes, foreign operations, R&D and other tax credits, tax audit settlements, incentive-stock options and domestic production activities deductions. Our annual effective tax rate was 26.5%, 27.8% and 30.3% in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nBusiness Outlook\nLong-Term Debt\nASV from our U.S. operations was $754.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, up 8.3% organically from a year ago. International ASV totaled $395.5 million, up 10.7% organically from a year ago. ASV from our international operations represented 34.4% of our Company-wide total, its highest level in FactSet history. Our European organic ASV achieved a growth rate of 8.7% over the last 12 months while Asia Pacific organic ASV grew by 17.0%. We have seen notable wins in both the sovereign wealth and investment management space and growth globally, with the addition of new clients in all three segments.\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of August 31, 2016 and the corresponding effect that these obligations will have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\n\nLetters of Credit\nLiquidity\nAsia Pacific operating income increased 17.5% to $42.6 million compared to $36.3 million in fiscal 2014. The increase was due to incremental revenues of $8.2 million and the effects of favorable foreign currency fluctuations on our expense base, partially offset by higher employee compensation. The higher employee compensation costs were due an 11.0% increase in headcount from fiscal 2014.\nClient and User Additions\nSG&A expenses increased 1.9% to $269.5 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to $264.4 million in fiscal 2014. Expressed as a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses decreased 190 basis points to 26.8% in fiscal 2015 due to lower employee compensation and lower occupancy costs.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe make significant estimates in determining our accrued compensation. Approximately 15% of our total employee compensation is variable and discretionary. We conduct a final review of Company and departmental individual performance each year end to determine the amount of discretionary employee compensation. We also review compensation throughout the year to determine how overall performance tracks against management's expectations. Management takes these and other factors, including historical performance, into account in reviewing accrued compensation estimates on a quarterly basis and adjusts accrual rates as appropriate. As of August 31, 2016 and 2015 the amount of the variable employee compensation recorded within accrued compensation was $38.2 million and $38.6 million, respectively.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nEmployee compensation, including stock-based compensation, when expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 230 basis points in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. This increase was primarily due to new employees hired in the past year. Over the last 12 months, we have added 604 net new employees involved with content collection and 266 net new engineering and product development employees, as we continue to focus on servicing our existing client base, expanding our content and improving our applications. The increase in employee headcount includes 123 employees added from the Portware acquisition in cost of sales related roles. Amortization of acquired intangible assets, when expressed as a percentage of revenues, increased 50 basis points in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the addition of $75.5 million of intangible assets related to the acquisition of Portware. Computer-related expenses, which include depreciation, maintenance, software and other fees, increased 40 basis points when expressed as a percentage of revenues, as we require additional computer hardware and peripherals for new employees, upgrades to existing computer systems and the development of new internal systems to support our growing infrastructure.\nCost of Services\n* Amounts represent the cumulative catch-up adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of August 31, 2016.\n \u25cf GAAP operating margin is expected to range between 31.0% and 32.0%. Adjusted operating margin is expected to range between 32.5% and 33.5%. \nRevenues in fiscal 2016 were $1,127.1 million, up 12.0% compared to fiscal 2015. Our revenue growth drivers during fiscal 2016 were robust demand for our portfolio analytics ( PA\u201d) suite of products, including an expansion of our multi-asset class value added products, accelerated growth in our Content & Technology Solutions ( CTS\u201d), advancement in Workstation Solutions and significant progress in the Portware business, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency.\nOur impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. We have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.\n\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect our expectations as of September 27, 2016. Given the number of risk factors, uncertainties and assumptions discussed below, actual results may differ materially. We do not intend to update our forward-looking statements until our next quarterly results announcement, other than in publicly available statements.\nOn May 6, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a 13.6% increase in the regular quarterly dividend beginning with the dividend payment in June 2016 which was $0.50 per share, or $2.00 per share per annum. With our dividends and our share repurchases, in the aggregate, we have returned $431.0 million to shareholders over the past 12 months. Future cash dividends will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors we considered relevant and is subject to final determination by our Board of Directors.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\n \u25cf Critical Accounting Estimates \nOperating Income by Segment\n\nFiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015\nIn 2016, we sought to strengthen and expand our core business model. Our strategic acquisition of Portware in October 2015 has provided a new stream of revenue and growth. Portware revenues have grown in double-digits since the acquisition and Portware is now break-even on an earnings per share basis. Additionally, we sold our Market Metrics business in July 2016 and recognized an after-tax gain of $81.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The sale allowed us to sharpen our focus on our long-term growth drivers and our mission to deliver world-class insight and information through our analytics, service, content and technology.\nOperating income increased 5.4% to $349.7 million in fiscal year 2016 compared to the prior year. Our operating margin for fiscal 2016 was 31.0%, down from 33.0% a year ago. The lower operating margin was primarily due to Portware's operations, which reduced our operating margin by 120 basis points in fiscal 2016. Additionally, higher employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, reduced our operating margin collectively by 90 basis points. In fiscal 2016, we also incurred non-recurring charges of approximately $4.6 million related primarily to legal matters. Offsetting these drivers was organic revenue growth of 9.9% and lower occupancy costs.\n (2) ASV grew 8.8% organically year over year. Organic ASV excludes ASV from acquisitions and dispositions completed within the last 12 months and the effects of foreign currency. \nThe table below, for the periods indicated, provides selected cash flow information:\nIn fiscal 2016, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $232.3 million under the existing share repurchase program compared to 1.7 million shares for $252.8 million under the existing share repurchase program during fiscal 2015. In July 2016, we entered into an ASR Agreement to repurchase $120.0 million of our common stock. We received 595,607 shares of common stock on July 5, 2016, which was approximately 80% of the total number of shares of common stock expected to be repurchased under the ASR Agreement. The final settlement of the ASR Agreement occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with FactSet receiving an additional 102,916 shares of its common stock. In conjunction with the ASR Agreement, in May 2016, our Board of Directors approved a $165.0 million expansion of the existing share repurchase program. Including the expansion, $197.0 million remained available for future share repurchases as of August 31, 2016.\nIncome Taxes, Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share\nMarket Trends\nAs disclosed earlier in the Capital Resources section of this MD&A, we borrowed $35.0 million in the form of a Eurodollar rate loan to fund the acquisition of Code Red in February 2015, and $265.0 million in the form of a Eurodollar rate loan to fund the acquisition of Portware in October 2015. The maturity date on all outstanding loan amounts is September 21, 2018, and there are no prepayment penalties in the event that we elect to prepay the loan prior to its scheduled maturity date. The amount borrowed bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to the Eurodollar rate plus 0.75% and is reported as Long-term debt within our Consolidated Balance Sheet at August 31, 2016.\nRevenues from our U.S. segment increased 8.7% to $678.8 million in fiscal 2015 compared to $624.6 million in fiscal 2014. Our fiscal 2015 U.S. revenue growth rate of 8.7% reflected increases in the number of users and clients of FactSet within the U.S., a rise in sales of our PA suite of products, continued demand for our proprietary content, $5.2 million of incremental revenue from the acquisition of Code Red and a strong performance by our U.S. investment management sales team. Our U.S. buy-side sales team saw sustained demand for our fixed income portfolio products, multi-asset class risk and stress testing, attribution and publishing products. Revenues from our U.S. operations accounted for 67.4% of our consolidated revenues during fiscal 2015, down from 67.9% in fiscal 2014, as our international ASV growth rate surpassed our U.S. ASV growth rate by 150 basis points.\n \u25cf New Accounting Pronouncements \nFiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015\nNet cash used in investing activities was $64.9 million during fiscal 2015, a decrease of $5.8 million over fiscal 2014 due to a $12.1 million decrease in cash used in business acquisitions and a $1.7 million increase in proceeds from sales of short-term investments, net of purchases, partially offset by a $7.9 million increase in cash used for capital expenditures.\n (2) Total operating expenses in fiscal 2015 include an incremental $3.0 million from the vesting of performance-based equity instruments and $3.2 million related to changes in the senior leadership responsible for the Company's salesforce. Of this total, $3.8 million was reported within SG&A expenses with the remainder in cost of services. \n \u25cf Named as one of the Best Workplaces in France\u201d \nAnnual Subscription Value Growth\nPartially offsetting the growth in cost of services during fiscal 2015 was a reduction in computer depreciation expense, which decreased 20 basis points in fiscal 2015 compared fiscal 2014. This decrease was primarily due to the continued use of fully depreciated equipment and our transition to more efficient and cost-effective servers in our data centers.\nCapital Needs\nWe describe our significant accounting policies in Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 below.\nDividends\nWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. In addition, there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements.\n* Amounts represent the cumulative catch-up adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of August 31, 2016.\n \u25cf Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements \nFiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015\n \u25cf Liquidity \nFiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014\nFiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015\nAs of August 31, 2016, there were 65,655 professionals using FactSet, an increase of 3,450 users in fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2016, we added 116 net new clients, increasing the number of clients by 3.9% over the prior year. Our total client count was 3,092 as of August 31, 2016. This net number reflects a reduction of 41 clients due to the sale of the Market Metrics business. We continue to focus on expanding our current client base as it is essential to our long-term growth strategy and encourages incremental sales growth of workstations, applications and content at our existing clients.\nWe performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, consistent with previous years, at which time it was determined that there were no indications of impairment, with the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units significantly exceeding carrying value. The carrying value of goodwill as of August 31, 2016 and 2015, was $452.9 million and $308.3 million, respectively.\n (1) Included in net cash used in investing activities during each fiscal year reported. \nThe Asia Pacific revenue growth rate of 12.0% was primarily due to net new user and client growth, increased PA subscriptions and our proficiency in selling additional services to existing clients, partially offset by negative foreign currency impact attributable to the change in the value of the Japanese Yen compared to the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reduced our Asia Pacific growth rate by 350 basis points.\nOf the total grant, 68,761 performance-based options are eligible for vesting based on achieving the growth targets over a two year measurement period ending February 28, 2017. As of August 31, 2016, total unamortized stock-based compensation of $1.3 million will be recognized as expense over the remaining vesting period of 2.4 years. A change, up or down, in the actual financial performance levels achieved by Code Red in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense:\nPerformance-based Equity Awards\nRevenues from our U.S. segment increased 11.3% to $755.5 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $678.8 million a year ago. Our fiscal 2016 U.S. revenue growth rate of 11.3% reflects increases in the number of users and clients of FactSet within the U.S., predominantly at buy-side hedge fund and middle-market clients. Additionally, we recognized $21.9 million of incremental revenue from the acquisition of Portware. Revenues from our U.S. operations accounted for 67.0% of our consolidated revenues during fiscal 2016, down from 67.4% a year ago, as our international ASV growth rate surpassed our U.S. ASV growth rate by 200 basis points.\n \u25cf Key Metrics \nOur industry-leading customer care is largely due to the talent of our employee population. As of August 31, 2016, employee headcount was 8,375, up 13.8% from a year ago. Excluding the acquired Portware workforce and employees of the divested Market Metrics business, headcount increased 13.4% from a year ago. The increases were primarily in positions that differentiate us in the market - software engineering, client service and content. In order to optimize costs, we have invested in expanding our footprint and talent pool in India and the Philippines, where we now have a combined workforce of over 4,800. Additionally, in fiscal 2016, we opened offices in Melbourne, Australia and Los Angeles, California.\nClient Service / Consultants\nEducating our clients is also an important component of our service. Not only do we teach our users the nuances of our software and content offerings, but FactSet personnel are often thought-leaders in a particular area of financial modeling in our rapidly evolving industry. As a result, clients look to FactSet as a trusted partner to stay on the cutting edge of financial modeling and analysis. During fiscal 2016, over 1,600 clients attended live or online FactSet training sessions and we saw a 7% increase in online learning registration.\n \u25cf Dividends \nAs a testament to our broadening suite of premium products and the strength of our business and service model FactSet was awarded Best Overall Provider,\u201d \"Best Research Provider\" and \"Best Analytics Provider\" by Inside Market Data in May 2016,. We were also named the Best Data Analytics Provider\u201d by Waters Technology in July 2016. Other recognition included Best Research and Analytics Tool\u201d award for our wealth management tools at the annual Systems in the City Awards. Portware also earned Best Buy-side EMS\u201d for the third time and was included on Global Finance's first annual list of forex leaders, \"The Innovators 2015 - Foreign Exchange.\"\nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2017 Expectations\nFactSet is a leading provider of integrated financial information and big data analytical applications to the global investment community. We deliver insight and information to investment professionals through our analytics, service, content, and technology. By integrating comprehensive datasets and analytics across asset classes with client data, we support the workflow of both buy-side and sell-side clients. These professionals include portfolio managers, wealth managers, research and performance analysts, risk managers, sell-side equity research professionals, investment bankers and fixed income professionals. From streaming real-time data to historical information, including quotes, estimates, news and commentary, FactSet offers unique and third-party content through desktop, wireless, and off-platform solutions. Our wide application suite offers tools and resources including company and industry analyses, full screening tools, portfolio analysis, risk profiles, alpha-testing, portfolio optimization and research management solutions. Recent additions to our offering include a complete services solution focused on verifying, cleaning and loading portfolio data across asset classes, and an execution management system through our acquisition of Portware. Our revenues are derived from subscriptions to products and services such as workstations, analytics, enterprise data and content, research management and trade execution. Investment management (buy-side) clients account for 82.6% of our annual subscription value and the remainder is derived from investment banking firms (sell-side) that perform mergers and acquisitions ( M&A\u201d) advisory work, capital markets services and equity research.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nCapital Resources\n (3) Represents the amount due under the Company's Loan under its Revolving Credit Facility. \nOur Workstation Solutions, including Research Management Solutions ( RMS\u201d), StreetAccount, Wealth Management and Sales & Trading, continued to be positive revenue growth drivers during fiscal 2016. RMS, which is comprised of our Internal Research Notes ( IRN\u201d) and Code Red products, provides a centralized database for collecting both internal and external research, as well as fast and efficient ways to store and retrieve notes and documents over a shared drive. Growth in our RMS suite was driven by the ongoing regulatory demand for transparency across an increasing number of workflows. Code Red, which we acquired in February 2015, has been a strong local solution supplement to our hosted IRN solution. In adding Code Red's product offering to FactSet's existing RMS, we have been able to offer an RMS for all our clients' workflows.\nPurchase orders do not necessarily reflect a binding commitment but are merely indicative of authorizations and intention to conclude purchases in the future. For the purpose of this tabular disclosure, purchase obligations for goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. It is expected that all the contractual obligations noted in the table will be funded from existing cash and cash flows from operations. Expected timing pertaining to the contractual obligations included in the table above has been estimated based on information currently available. The amounts paid and the timing of those payments may differ based on when the goods and services provided by our vendors to whom we are contractually obligated are actually received as well as due to changes to agreed-upon amounts for any of our obligations.\nForeign Currency Hedges\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Our MD&A is presented in the following sections:\nOf our total employees, 2,407 were located in the U.S., 849 in Europe and 5,119 in Asia Pacific. Approximately 55% of our employees were involved with content collection, 24% worked in product development, software and systems engineering, another 18% conducted sales and consulting services and the remaining 3% provided administrative support. We are proud to have received the following accolades during fiscal 2016:\n\nFiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014\nResults of Operations\nFor an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position as of the reporting date. Otherwise, no benefit can be recognized. The tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We will classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that we anticipate payment of cash within one year. Additionally, we accrue interest on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws. Interest is classified as income tax expense in the financial statements.\nEuropean revenues advanced 10.6% year over year which was attributable to increases in client and user counts, continued growth in ASV from European sell-side clients and robust sales of PA subscriptions, partially offset by the negative effects of foreign currency. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reduced our European growth rate by 40 basis points.\nForward-Looking Factors\nFiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014\n\nFiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014\n \u25cf British Pound Sterling - foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 50% of our British Pound Sterling exposure through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. \nOperating Expenses\nOn February 6, 2015, we entered into a Credit Agreement between FactSet, as the borrower, and Bank of America, N.A., as the lender (the Lender\u201d). At that date, the Credit Agreement provided for a $35.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), under which we could request borrowings. The Credit Agreement also allowed us to arrange for additional borrowings for an aggregate amount of up to $265.0 million, provided that any such request for additional borrowings was in a minimum amount of $25.0 million.\nRevenues in fiscal 2015 were $1,006.8 million, up 9.4% compared to fiscal 2014. Our revenue growth drivers during fiscal 2015 were increases in ASV, clients and users, accelerated demand for our fixed income portfolio products, portfolio analytics suite of products, sales of equity attribution and multi-asset class risk models, additional purchases of our Portfolio Services solutions, expansion of our proprietary content, and continued growth of our RMS offering.\nEuropean revenues advanced 10.4% year over year which was attributable to increases in client and user counts, increased sales of PA subscriptions and incremental Portware revenues of $7.3 million, partially offset by the negative effects of foreign currency. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reduced our European growth rate by 30 basis points.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $158.4 million in fiscal 2016, representing a $93.5 million increase from fiscal 2015. This increase was primarily due to our acquisition of Portware in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 which resulted in a net cash outflow of $262.9 million compared to a net cash outflow of $34.8 million for acquisitions occurring in fiscal 2015. Additionally, cash used in investing activities increased year over year due to an increase in capital expenditures, primarily due to the fit-out of new space in New York, Chicago and the expansion of our corporate headquarters in Norwalk. These cash outflows were partially offset by net proceeds of $153.1 million from the sale of our Market Metrics business and an increase in proceeds from the sales of investments (net of purchases) of $3.5 million year over year.\nLong-lived Assets\nFiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015\n \u25cf Ranked #41 on Great Place to Work\u00ae 2016 Best Workplaces in the U.K.\u201d The report highlighted our collaborative culture and marks our eighth appearance on the list. \n \u25cf Indian Rupee - foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 75% of our Indian Rupee exposure through the first quarter of fiscal 2019. \nSignificant progress in Portware\n \u25cf GAAP diluted EPS should range between $1.62 and $1.66. Adjusted EPS is expected to range between $1.68 and $1.72. The midpoint of the adjusted EPS range represents 14.5% growth over the prior year. \n \u25cf Capital Resources \nSignificant Accounting Policies\nAs of August 31, 2016, we maintained the following foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure:\nThe Asia Pacific revenue growth rate of 22.8% was primarily due to an increase in the number of workstations, advancement in our multi-asset class risk and analytics, as well positive growth in our fee business. Portware contributed $4.1 million in sales since its acquisition in fiscal 2016. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased our Asia Pacific growth rate by 90 basis points.\nRobust Demand for Analytics\nAnnual client retention as of August 31, 2016, was greater than 95% of ASV and 94% when expressed as a percentage of clients, consistent with the prior year, and despite market-related cancellations which impacted our ASV growth rates. Our retention success, demonstrating that a majority of our clients maintain their subscriptions to FactSet year over year, highlights the strength of our business model. August 31, 2016, our largest individual client accounted for 2% of total subscriptions, and annual subscriptions from our ten largest clients did not surpass 15% of total client subscriptions, consistent with August 31, 2015.\nReturning Value to Stockholders\nCapital Expenditures\nThe fiscal 2015 provision for income taxes was $92.7 million, up from $91.9 million in fiscal 2014. The 0.9% increase was due to a 10.0% increase in pre-tax income offset by the reenactment of the U.S. Federal R&D tax credit in December 2014. The reenactment of the credit was retroactive to January 1, 2014 and extended through the end of the 2014 calendar year. The reenactment resulted in a discrete income tax benefit of $5.1 million during fiscal 2015. Additionally, we recognized tax benefits of $3.7 million related to finalizing prior year tax returns and other discrete tax items.\nOn June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom ( UK\u201d) held a referendum in which British citizens approved an exit from the European Union ( EU\u201d), commonly referred to as Brexit.\u201d As a result of the referendum, the global markets and currencies have been adversely impacted, including a sharp decline in the value of the British Pound Sterling as compared to the U.S. dollar. Volatility in exchange rates is expected to continue in the short term as the UK negotiates its exit from the EU. We currently hedge approximately 50% of our British Pound Sterling exposure through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, thus reducing our currency risk. In the longer term, any impact from Brexit on us will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations. Although it is unknown what the result of those negotiations will be, it is possible that new terms may adversely affect our operations and financial results. While we evaluate our own risks and uncertainty related to Brexit, we will continue to partner with our clients to help them navigate the fluctuating international markets. Our products, including our datasets such as GeoRev, allow our clients to understand geographic exposure and assess the risks of operating on a global scale so they may make informed business decisions.\nOur reward for investing in a consulting group comprised of several hundred individuals is client loyalty, as evidenced by an annual client retention rate of greater than 95% of ASV as of August 31, 2016. Our consulting teams have been trained to listen to our clients' needs and transfer this knowledge directly to the product development teams, helping us transform suggestions into new or enhanced product offerings. In fiscal 2016, FactSet employees made over 45,000 client consulting visits, over 182,000 consulting calls and handled over 282,000 client questions. In addition, our new support desk in Manila, the Philippines handled over 5,000 client emails.\nAdditionally, in July 2016, we entered into an ASR Agreement to repurchase $120.0 million of our common stock. We received 595,607 shares of common stock on July 5, 2016 which was approximately 80% of the total number of shares of common stock expected to be repurchased under the ASR Agreement. The final settlement of the ASR Agreement occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, with FactSet receiving an additional 102,916 shares of its common stock. In conjunction with the ASR Agreement, in May 2016, our Board of Directors approved a $165.0 million expansion of the existing share repurchase program. Including the expansion, $197.0 million remained available for future share repurchases as of August 31, 2016. Combining our dividends and share repurchases, we returned $431.0 million to stockholders during fiscal 2016.\n\nAs of August 31, 2016, the fair value of our long-term debt was $300.0 million, which we believe approximates the carrying amount as the terms and interest rates approximate market rates given its floating interest rate basis.\nAs of August 31, 2016, we owed no commitment fees since we borrowed the full amount of the Credit Agreement. Other fees incurred, such as legal costs to draft and review the Credit Agreement, totaled less than $0.1 million and were capitalized as loan origination fees. These loan origination fees are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Loan (three years) using the effective interest method. The Credit Agreement contains covenants restricting certain FactSet activities, which are usual and customary for this type of loan.\nSG&A expenses increased 7.6% to $290.0 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $269.5 million in fiscal 2015. Expressed as a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses decreased 110 basis points to 25.7% in fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower employee compensation and lower occupancy costs, which include depreciation of furniture and fixtures, partially offset by expenses related to non-recurring legal matters and higher marketing costs.\nGoodwill is not amortized as it is estimated to have an indefinite life. At least annually, we are required to test goodwill at the reporting unit level for potential impairment, and, if impaired, write down to fair value based on the present value of discounted cash flows. Our reporting units evaluated for potential impairment were the U.S., Europe and Asia Pacific, which reflect the level of internal reporting we use to manage our business and operations. The three reporting units are consistent with the operating segments reported as there is no discrete financial information available for the subsidiaries within each operating segment. The impairment test requires management to make judgments in connection with these reporting units, including assigning assets, liabilities, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit.\nKey Metrics\nFiscal 2016 results continued our positive topline growth. Revenue was up 12.0% while annual subscription value ( ASV\u201d) increased 8.8% organically. This fiscal year marked our 38th year of operation, our 36th consecutive year of revenue growth and our 20th consecutive year of earnings growth as a public company. The pressures our clients have experienced in the past 12 months have not abated and we have dedicated ourselves to helping them navigate an uncertain environment. As of August 31, 2016, ASV totaled $1.15 billion, an increase of $92.0 million over the prior year. In addition, clients and users reached new highs of 3,092 and 65,655, respectively, in fiscal 2016. We returned $431.0 million to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, an increase of 33.5% over the prior year. This included $120.0 million relating to an accelerated share repurchase agreement ( ASR Agreement\u201d) which we entered into in July 2016.\nFiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014\n\nAccrued Compensation\nFiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015\nA client-centric approach has always been a key foundation of our success at FactSet. We support our powerful information and analytical applications with a team of financial data and modeling experts. Client satisfaction is a key metric by which we measure the success of our service. According to our fiscal 2016 global client satisfaction survey, 96% of respondents were satisfied or very satisfied with FactSet's support, consistent with the prior year. The depth of our knowledge, the data behind the models and the complex mathematics behind the answers each create an opportunity for us to forge close working relationships with our user community.\nDuring fiscal 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $91.0 million compared to $187.3 million in fiscal 2015. The year over year decrease in cash used was primarily due to proceeds from long-term debt of $265.0 million, offset by an increase in cash used in share repurchases of $100.6 million, lower proceeds and tax benefits from stock options exercised of $25.4 million, and an increase in payments of regular quarterly dividends of $7.7 million. The proceeds from long-term debt related to additional borrowings under the Second Amendment (defined in Capital Needs) to our credit agreement dated February 6, 2015 (the Credit Agreement\u201d) used to fund our acquisition of Portware on October 16, 2015. Cash used in share repurchases increased year over year as we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $232.3 million under the existing share repurchase program and 0.6 million shares for $120.0 million related to the ASR Agreement entered into in July 2016. We repurchased 1.7 million shares for $252.8 million in fiscal 2015 under the existing share repurchase program. Dividend payments increased as our Board of Directors approved a 13.6% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share, or $2.00 per share per annum, beginning with the dividend payment in June 2016.\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by numerous factors such as changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations of them. Significant judgment is required to determine recognition and measurement. Further, as a result of certain ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely affect our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\n (1) Operating lease amounts include future minimum lease payments under all our non-cancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year. For more information on our operating leases, see Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. \nNet income increased 13.9% to $241.1 million and diluted earnings per share increased 16.1% to $5.71 during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. Drivers of the increase in net income and earnings per share during fiscal 2015 included revenue growth of 9.4%, income tax benefits of $8.8 million, foreign currency benefits of $4.0 million and a decrease in diluted shares outstanding of 1.7%. These net income drivers were partially offset by incremental employee compensation expense within cost of services due to the hiring of 721 net new employees in fiscal 2015 and after-tax charges of $2.2 million and $2.1 million related to changes in the senior leadership of our sales teams and the vesting of performance-based equity instruments, respectively.\nJuly 2012 Performance-based Option Grant Review\n (2) We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities, which includes the cash cost for taxes and changes in working capital, less capital expenditures. \nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nCash and cash equivalents aggregated to $158.9 million or 21.6% of our total assets at August 31, 2015, compared with $116.4 million or 17.5% of our total assets August 31, 2014. Our cash and cash equivalents increased $42.5 million during fiscal 2015 due to cash provided by operations of $306.4 million, $71.5 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, $35.0 million in proceeds from long-term debt and $28.9 million in tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements. These cash inflows were partially offset by $34.8 million in cash paid to acquire businesses, $252.8 million in share repurchases, dividend payments of $66.6 million, capital expenditures of $25.7 million and purchases of investments, net of proceeds, of $4.4 million.\nThere were no other outstanding foreign currency forward contracts as of August 31, 2016. A loss on derivatives of $0.5 million was recorded into operating income during fiscal 2016, compared to a loss of $0.6 million in fiscal 2015.\nCertain wholly owned subsidiaries within the European and Asia Pacific segments operate under a functional currency different from the U.S. dollar. The financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses. Translation gains and losses that arise from translating assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders' equity.\nBusiness Combinations\nOverall, ASV growth for our buy-side business was 9.0%, down 40 basis points from the prior year period while our sell-side business experienced 7.6% growth, down 180 basis points from the prior year period. The decrease in the buy and sell-side growth rates can be attributed to an increase in market-related cancellations.\nAs of August 31, 2016, our non-U.S. dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized over the next 12 months were estimated to be $20.0 million while our non-U.S. dollar denominated expenses were estimated to be $213.3 million, which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of $193.3 million. Our foreign currency exchange exposure is related to our operating expense base in countries outside the U.S., where 71% of our employees were located as of August 31, 2016. During fiscal 2016, foreign currency movements decreased operating income by $11.6 million, compared to $11.2 million a year ago.\n \u25cf The annual effective tax rate is expected to range between 28.0% and 29.0%. \nDue to the global nature of our operations, we conduct business outside the U.S. in several currencies including the British Pound Sterling, Euro, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen and Philippine Peso. To the extent that our international activities increase in the future, our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase. To manage this exposure, we utilize derivative instruments (foreign currency forward contracts). By their nature, all derivative instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of market and credit risk. The market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. Credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposure to the counterparties associated with these instruments. Our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings associated with changes in foreign currency.\nFiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014\nOn August 5, 2016, we declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. The cash dividend of $20.0 million was paid on September 20, 2016, to common stockholders of record on August 31, 2016 using our existing cash generated by operations.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nIn connection with the acquisition of Code Red during the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we granted 137,522 performance-based stock options. These performance-based options are eligible to vest four years from date of grant if certain Code Red ASV and operating margin targets are achieved over the measurement period. The option holders must also remain employed by FactSet for the options to be eligible to vest.\nEstimated Tax Provision and Tax Contingencies\nAs of August 31, 2016, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling $8.8 million, including $1.3 million of accrued interest, recorded as Taxes Payable (non-current) within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions taken on tax returns but not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements. When applicable, we adjust the previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results when the position is effectively settled. If recognized, the unrecognized tax benefits and related interest would be recorded as a benefit to tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Audits by multiple tax authorities are currently ongoing. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. For this reason, we regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest.\nFiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014\n \u25cf Foreign Currency \nFiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015\n \u25cf Named as one of the 100 Best Workplaces for Women\u201d and Best Workplaces for Millennials\u201d in the U.S. by Great Place to Work\u00ae \nForeign Currency Exposure\nNet Income and Diluted Earnings per Share\nEmployee compensation, including stock-based compensation, when expressed as a percentage of revenues, decreased 130 basis points due to a higher percentage of our employee base working in a cost of services capacity versus SG&A. Of our total employee headcount increase in fiscal 2015, 84% was within our software engineering, content collection and product development teams, which are all included within cost of services. As such, SG&A employee compensation declined compared to the growth in cost of services. Occupancy costs, when expressed as a percentage of revenues, decreased 60 basis points, primarily due to furniture and leasehold improvements becoming fully depreciated, lower rent expense from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the timing of acquiring new real estate space. However, certain occupancy costs, such as rent, are temporary and are being driven by the timing of acquiring new space to support our growing employee population.\n2016 Year in Review\nFiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015\nWe granted 20,911 additional performance-based stock options to Portware employees in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Similar to the October 2015 grant, these performance-based options will vest 40% on the second anniversary date of the grant and 20% on each subsequent anniversary date if certain Portware revenue and operating income targets are achieved by October 16, 2017. The option holders must also remain employed by FactSet for the options to be eligible to vest. As of August 31, 2016, we do not believe these growth targets are probable of being achieved, and as such, no stock-based compensation expense is expected to be recognized in connection with these performance-based options. A change in the actual financial performance levels achieved by Portware in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense:\nFiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014\n* Amounts represent the cumulative catch-up adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of August 31, 2016.\nWe record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. All of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies and contingent consideration are recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date. The application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. Our estimates are based on historical experience, information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and when appropriate, includes assistance from independent third party appraisal firms. Our significant assumptions and estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $187.3 million during fiscal 2015. Of this total, $252.8 million related to the repurchase of 1.7 million shares under the existing share repurchase program and $66.6 million was for the payment of regular quarterly dividends. Partially offsetting these uses of cash were proceeds received from employee stock plans totaling $71.5 million, related tax benefits of $28.9 million and long-term debt of $35.0 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $89.4 million lower in the current year due to a $36.3 million increase in proceeds from employee stock option exercises and its related income tax benefits, proceeds from long-term debt of $35.0 million and a decrease in share repurchases of $23.6 million. These positive cash movements were partially offset by an incremental $5.5 million in dividend payments due to the 12.8% increase in our regular quarterly dividend, beginning in May 2015.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to financial risks involving the volatility of equity markets as well as foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.\nCost of services increased 14.6% to $405.3 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. Expressed as a percentage of revenues, cost of services was 40.3% in fiscal 2015, an increase of 190 basis points from fiscal 2014. The increase was driven by higher employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, partially offset by lower computer depreciation.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Portware during the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we granted 530,418 performance-based stock options. These performance-based options will vest 40% on the second anniversary date of the grant and 20% on each subsequent anniversary date if certain Portware revenue and operating income targets are achieved by October 16, 2017. The option holders must also remain employed by FactSet for the options to be eligible to vest. As of August 31, 2016, we do not believe these growth targets are probable of being achieved, and as such, no stock-based compensation expense is expected to be recognized in connection with these performance-based options. A change in the actual financial performance levels achieved by Portware in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense:\nImpact of Foreign Currency\nDuring fiscal years 2016 and 2015, our Board of Directors declared the following dividends:\nNet income increased 40.6% to $338.8 million and diluted earnings per share increased 43.4% to $8.19 during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. A large component of the increase in net income and diluted earnings per share during fiscal 2016 was an after-tax gain of $81.7 million related to the sale of the Market Metrics business. The gain increased diluted earnings per share by $2.01. Excluding the after-tax gain on sale, net income increased 6.7% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, while diluted EPS was $6.18. The increase year over year was primarily due to organic ASV growth of 8.8% and tax benefits of $10.5 million related to the permanent reenactment of the U.S. Federal R&D tax credit and finalizing prior years' tax returns and other discrete items. These increases were partially offset by incremental employee compensation expense due to the hiring of 1,015 net new employees (including 166 employees from acquisitions completed in the last 12 months). Additionally, Portware's operations reduced our operating margin by 120 basis points in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2016 we also incurred non-recurring charges of approximately $3.3 million, after-tax, related primarily to legal matters. During fiscal 2016, foreign currency movements increased operating income by $11.6 million compared to a benefit of $11.2 million in the same period of fiscal 2015.\nThe fiscal 2016 provision for income taxes was $122.2 million, up 31.8% from the same period a year ago. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company recognized tax expense of $30.8 million related to the gain on sale of the Company's Market Metrics business. Excluding tax expense from the gain, the provision for income taxes was $91.4 million in fiscal 2016, a decrease of 1.4% from fiscal 2015, primarily due to income tax benefits from the permanent reenactment of the U.S. Federal R&D Tax Credit in December 2015, finalizing prior year tax returns and other discrete items. Overall, we recognized income tax benefits of $10.5 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $6.5 million in the same period in fiscal 2015. Offsetting the tax benefits and excluding the gain on sale was an increase in taxable income of $14.8 million.\n (1) Total operating expenses in fiscal 2016 include $4.6 million related primarily to legal matters, $2.8 million from restructuring actions initiated by the Company and $1.8 million related to a change in the vesting of performance-based stock options. Of this total, $6.0 million was reported within SG&A expenses with the remainder in cost of services. ", "item_7_text": "See Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption, which we include here by reference.\nSlightly offsetting the revenue drivers disclosed above, foreign currency movements decreased revenues by $0.1 million, or less than 10 basis points, during fiscal 2016 compared to the year ago quarter. Excluding revenues from acquisitions and dispositions completed within the last twelve months and the effects of foreign currency, our organic revenue growth rate for the quarter was 8.8%.\n \u25cf Revenues are expected to range between $286 million and $292 million. \n \u25cf Executive Overview \nOur impairment analysis contains uncertainties as it requires management to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate industry and economic factors including market conditions, legal and technological factors and the profitability of our business strategies. It is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategies taking into consideration present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations. We have not made any material changes in our impairment analysis methodology during the past three fiscal years. While we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for goodwill impairment losses, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions. Future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment do exist and that goodwill associated with our previous acquisitions is impaired, which could result in an impairment loss in our Consolidated Statements of Income and a write-down of the related asset.\nAsia Pacific operating income increased 24.4% to $53.0 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $42.6 million a year ago. The increase in Asia Pacific operating income was due to revenue growth of 22.8% and benefits from a stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by increases in employee compensation. The impact of foreign currency increased Asia Pacific operating income by $6.5 million year over year. Employee compensation increased due to a 19.3% increase in the Asia Pacific employee headcount year over year.\n \u25cf Results of Operations \nAs of August 31, 2016, the gross notional value of foreign currency forward contracts to purchase British Pound Sterling with U.S. dollars was \u00a323.1 million. The gross notional value of foreign currency forward contracts to purchase Indian Rupees with U.S. dollars was Rs. 4.2 billion.\nFiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014\nAt August 31, 2016 and 2015, we had no off-balance sheet financing or other arrangements with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships (such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities) established for purposes of facilitating off-balance sheet financing or other debt arrangements or for other contractually limited purposes.\nWe saw increased demand for total portfolio risk analytics resulting in increased traction for our fixed income and multi-asset class, performance and risk offerings. In fiscal 2016, we expanded our robust offering of analytics, models, stress testing and client reporting. Our Portfolio Services offering supports our clients in integrating, cleansing and building strong analytics on top of their data. This managed service is an example of how we have broadened our sources of revenue, while responding to client needs. Clients continue to find value in our ability to serve as a single solution for their analytics, risk and publishing needs, over a variety of asset classes, which enables them to analyze securities and portfolios based on a variety of asset classes.\nThe following is a review of our key metrics:\n\nAll of the above cash dividends were paid from existing cash resources. Future cash dividends will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors we considered relevant and is subject to final determination by our Board of Directors.\nOn May 6, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a 13.6% increase in the regular quarterly dividend beginning with the dividend payment in June 2016 which was $0.50 per share, or $2.00 per share per annum. In fiscal 2016, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $232.3 million under the existing share repurchase program compared to 1.7 million shares for $252.8 million under the existing share repurchase program during fiscal 2015.\nOur identifiable intangible assets consist of acquired content databases, client relationships, software technology, non-compete agreements and trade names resulting from acquisitions, which have been fully integrated into our operations. Depending on the nature of the intangible asset, it is amortized on either a straight-line or an accelerated basis using estimated useful lives ranging from two to twenty years. These useful lives are evaluated quarterly to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. If the estimate of the remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. There were no adjustments to the useful lives of intangible assets subject to amortization during any of the periods presented. These intangible assets have no assigned residual values as of August 31, 2016 and 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nOctober 2015 and August 2016 Performance-based Option Grant Review\nWe have an employee stock-based compensation plan, which allows for the issuance of performance-based equity awards to employees. Accounting guidance requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all performance-based equity awards made to employees based on the estimated fair values of the awards that are expected to vest. At the end of each reporting period, management must make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving our performance targets because the number of stock options that vest will be predicated on us achieving these levels. However, there is no current guarantee that such options will vest in whole or in part.\nFebruary 2015 Performance-based Option Grant Review\nThe $300.0 million borrowed under the Credit Agreement bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to the Eurodollar rate plus 0.75% and is reported as Long-term debt within the Consolidated Balance Sheet at August 31, 2016. The Eurodollar rate is defined in the Credit Agreement as the rate per annum equal to one-month LIBOR. Interest on the Loan is payable quarterly in arrears and on the maturity date. During fiscal 2016 and 2015, we paid approximately $3.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively, in interest on our outstanding Loan amount. The principal balance is payable in full on the maturity date.\n \u25cf Contractual Obligations \nCost of services increased 20.2% to $487.4 million as compared to the same period a year ago. Expressed as a percentage of revenues, cost of services was 43.2% in fiscal 2016, an increase of 290 basis points from a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by higher employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and computer-related expenses.\nCapital expenditures were $47.7 million during fiscal 2016, up from $25.7 million a year ago. Approximately $27.7 million, or 58%, of our capital expenditures related to the build out of office space including $15.1 million at our New York location, $3.9 million at our Chicago location and $1.4 million at our corporate headquarters in Norwalk. The remainder of our capital expenditures was primarily for purchases of more servers for our existing data centers, additional laptop computers and peripherals for new employees, upgrades to existing computer systems and improvements to our telecommunication equipment.\nEuropean operating income increased 13.0% to $131.4 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $116.3 million a year ago. The increase in European operating income was due to revenue growth of 10.4% and benefits from a stronger U.S. dollar. The impact of foreign currency increased European operating income by $5.1 million year over year.\nForeign Currency\nShare Repurchase Program\nAnnual subscription value at any given point in time represents the forward-looking revenues for the next twelve months from all subscription services currently being supplied to clients. With proper notice to us, our clients are able to add to, delete portions of, or terminate service at any time, subject to certain contractual limitations. ASV totaled $1.15 billion at August 31, 2016, up 8.8% organically over the prior year. Organic ASV excludes ASV from acquisitions and dispositions completed within the past 12 months and the effects of foreign currency.\nForward-Looking Statements\n (4) Non-current income taxes payable of $8.8 million and non-current deferred tax liabilities of $1.7 million have been excluded in the table above due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future payments. \n\nIn addition, the Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio, as measured by total funded debt/EBITDA, below a specified level as of the end of each fiscal quarter. We were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Credit Agreement as of August 31, 2016.\nDividend Payment\nAdvancement in Workstation Solutions\nRevenues by Geographic Region\n \u25cf Ranked #89 on Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For.\u201d The only Connecticut-based company to make the list, we were recognized for our focus on career development and providing employees a variety of opportunities and experiences to learn. \nU.S. operating income decreased 4.5% to $165.3 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $173.0 million a year ago. The decrease in U.S. operating income is attributed to employee compensation growth, non-recurring charges of $4.4 million and $8.3 million of incremental amortization expense from Portware, partially offset by revenue growth of 11.3%. Employee compensation increased primarily due to a 7.6% increase in the U.S. employee headcount year over year. The non-recurring charges were related primarily to legal matters.\nFluctuations in our operating results, the degree of success of our accounts receivable collection efforts, the timing of tax and other payments as well as necessary capital expenditures to support growth of our operations will impact our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. The effect of our contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be considered in conjunction with the factors mentioned here.\nOur investment in product, coupled with the acquisition of Portware, now allows us to address an increasingly greater percentage of our clients' enterprise workflow. Our robust Portfolio Analytics solutions have been the cornerstone of our growth in the middle office. With a growing interest in passive investment instruments, such as exchange-traded funds ( ETFs\u201d), our effort to build out our ETF content and analytics product suite has made significant strides in fiscal 2016. We now have 29 ETFs in the marketplace based upon FactSet content and over 40 benchmarks. The first FactSet branded ETF, the SPDR FactSet Innovative Technology ETF, launched in January 2016.\nThe MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nOur operating segments are aligned with how we manage the business and the demographic markets in which we serve. Our internal financial reporting structure is based on three reportable segments, the U.S., Europe and Asia Pacific. This structure helps us better manage the business and view the markets we serve. Sales, consulting, data collection, product development and software engineering are the primary functional groups within each segment. Each segment records compensation expense, including stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of furniture and fixtures, amortization of leasehold improvements, communication costs, professional fees, rent expense, travel, marketing, office and other direct expenses. Expenditures associated with our data centers, third party data costs and corporate headquarters charges are recorded by the U.S. segment and are not allocated to the other segments. The content collection centers located in India and the Philippines benefit all of our segments, so the expenses incurred at these locations are allocated to each segment based on a percentage of revenues.\nWe expect that for at least the next 12 months, our operating expenses will continue to constitute a significant use of our cash. As of August 31, 2016, our total cash and cash equivalents worldwide was $228.4 million, with $300.0 million in outstanding borrowings. Approximately $28.8 million of our total available cash and cash equivalents is held in bank accounts located within the U.S., $161.9 million in Europe (predominantly within the UK and France) and the remaining $37.7 million is held in the Asia Pacific region. As of August 31, 2016, we believe our liquidity (including cash on hand, cash from operating activities and other cash flows that we expect to generate) within each geographic segment will be sufficient to meet our short-term and long-term operating requirements, as they occur, including working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend payments, stock repurchases, growth objectives and other financing activities. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\n* Amounts represent the cumulative catch-up adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of August 31, 2016.\nEmployee compensation, including stock-based compensation, when expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased 150 basis points from a year ago due to a higher percentage of our employee base working in a cost of services capacity compared to an SG&A role. Of our total employee headcount increase in the last 12 months, only 14% were in SG&A related roles, including 43 employees from the Portware acquisition. Additionally, approximately 142 employees in SG&A related roles left the Company as part of the sale of the Market Metrics business in July 2016. As such, employee compensation classified as SG&A expense declined compared to the growth in cost of services. Occupancy costs, when expressed as a percentage of revenues, decreased 20 basis points, primarily due to furniture and leasehold improvements becoming fully depreciated. The Company incurred approximately $3.3 million in non-recurring expenses in fiscal 2016 related primarily to legal matters. Marketing expenses increased $1.2 million year over year driven by incremental branding and advertising costs.\nOperating income from our U.S. business advanced 4.8% to $173.0 million during fiscal 2015 compared to $165.0 million in fiscal 2014. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to $54.1 million of incremental revenues and a decrease in computer depreciation, partially offset by a rise in employee compensation expense. U.S. revenue growth was driven by increases in the number of users and clients of FactSet within the U.S., a rise in sales of our PA suite of products, continued demand for our proprietary content, $5.2 million of incremental revenue from the acquisition of Code Red and a strong performance by our U.S. investment management sales team. Excluding the acquired Code Red workforce, U.S. employee headcount increased 7.0% over fiscal 2014, leading to higher employee compensation costs during fiscal 2015. Computer-related expenses decreased due to the transition to more efficient and cost-effective servers in our data centers in addition to the continued use of fully depreciated servers.\nEmployee compensation, including stock-based compensation, when expressed as a percentage of revenues, increased 210 basis points during fiscal 2015 due to new classes of consultants, engineers and product developers hired in fiscal 2015, new additions at our proprietary content collection locations, the addition of 32 employees from the Code Red acquisition, an increase in variable compensation and annual base salary increases. In fiscal 2015, we added 344 net new employees involved with content collection, 252 net new engineering and product development employees and 124 net new consultants. In addition, of the total incremental $6.2 million expense recorded in fiscal 2015 from the vesting of performance-based equity instruments and changes in the senior leadership responsible for the Company's salesforce, $2.4 million was reported within cost of services. Expenses associated with the operation of the Code Red business increased cost of services by $3.5 million during fiscal 2015 due to compensation paid to the acquired workforce, including stock-based compensation from equity based awards granted, amortization of acquired intangible assets and computer-related expenses.\nFree cash flow for fiscal 2016 was $283.4 million. Free cash flow generated during fiscal 2016 was attributable to $338.8 million of net income, including an after-tax gain on sale of $81.7 million, $50.6 million of positive working capital changes and $58.3 million in non-cash expenses less $47.7 million in capital expenditures. Free cash flow generated in the last twelve months was up $2.6 million from the comparable year ago period due to higher levels of net income and the timing of payables and accrued compensation, offset by incremental capital expenditures.\nIn addition to current and historical information, this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements regarding future events and our future results that are based on management's current expectations, estimates, forecast and projections about the industries in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, are statements that could be deemed to be forward-looking statements. These include statements about our strategy for growth, product development, market position, subscriptions and expected expenditures and financial results. Forward-looking statements may be identified by words like expects,\u201d anticipates,\u201d plans,\u201d intends,\u201d projects,\u201d should,\u201d indicates,\u201d continues,\u201d ASV,\u201d subscriptions,\u201d believes,\u201d estimates,\u201d may\u201d and similar expressions. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth, trends in our business and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Therefore, actual results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. We will publicly update forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events in accordance with applicable Securities and Exchange Commission regulations.\nFrom time to time, we are required to obtain letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. Approximately $1.0 million of standby letters of credit have been issued in connection with various current leased office spaces as of August 31, 2016. These standby letters of credit contain covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain minimum levels of consolidated net worth and certain leverage and fixed charge ratios. As of August 31, 2016 and 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the standby letters of credit.\nCapital expenditures were $47.7 million during fiscal 2016, up from $25.7 million a year ago. Approximately $27.7 million, or 58%, of our capital expenditures related to the build out of office space including $15.1 million at our New York location, $3.9 million at our Chicago location and $1.4 million at our corporate headquarters in Norwalk. The remainder of our capital expenditures was primarily for purchases of more servers for our existing data centers, additional laptop computers and peripherals for new employees, upgrades to existing computer systems and improvements to our telecommunication equipment.\nAccelerated Growth in Content & Technology Solutions\nOperating income increased 9.8% to $331.9 million in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. Our operating margin for fiscal 2015 was 33.0%, up from 32.8% in fiscal 2014. Operating margin in fiscal 2015 was negatively impacted by a $3.2 million pre-tax charge related to changes in the senior leadership of our sales teams and a $3.0 million pre-tax charge primarily related to the vesting of performance-based equity instruments. Operating income in fiscal 2014 included $3.0 million of pre-tax charges related to vesting of performance-based equity instruments and the settlement of a legal claim. Excluding these charges, our fiscal 2015 adjusted operating margin was 33.6% compared to the fiscal 2014 adjusted operating margin of 33.2%. Revenue growth of 9.4% and net foreign currency benefits totaling of $11.2 million aided our current year operating margin expansion.\nIn July 2012, we granted 241,546 performance-based employee stock options, which are eligible to vest in 20% tranches depending upon future StreetAccount user growth through August 31, 2017. Through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, four of the growth targets as outlined within the terms of the grant were achieved. As such, 80%, or 193,256, of the options granted have vested. As of August 31, 2016, the fifth tranche is expected to vest on August 31, 2017, resulting in unamortized stock-based compensation expense of $0.3 million to be recognized over the remaining vesting period of 1.0 year. A change in the actual financial performance levels achieved by StreetAccount in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense:\nCash and cash equivalents aggregated to $228.4 million, or 22.4% of our total assets at August 31, 2016, compared with $158.9 million, or 21.6% of our total assets at August 31, 2015. Our cash and cash equivalents increased $69.5 million during fiscal 2016 due to cash provided by operations of $331.1 million, $153.1 million in proceeds from the sale of the Company's Market Metrics business, $56.9 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, $265.0 million in proceeds from long-term debt and $18.2 million in tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements. These cash inflows were partially offset by $262.9 million in cash paid to acquire Portware, $356.8 million in share repurchases, dividend payments of $74.2 million, capital expenditures of $47.7 million and purchases of investments, net of proceeds, of $0.9 million.\nIntangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of any impairment loss for intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. No impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented. Our ongoing consideration of the recoverability could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our results of operations. The carrying value of intangible assets as of August 31, 2016 and 2015, was $93.2 million and $40.1 million, respectively.\nEuropean operating income increased 15.2% during fiscal 2015 to $116.3 million due to revenue growth of 10.6% and the effects of favorable foreign currency fluctuations on our expense base, partially offset by increases in employee compensation, third-party data costs and occupancy expenses. The higher employee compensation costs were due to a 17.5% increase in headcount over fiscal 2014. The increase in occupancy costs, which includes rent expense, was due to an increase in leased space in London. Finally, the increased third-party data costs were due to the increased number of users year over year.\n (1) We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities, which includes the cash cost for taxes and changes in working capital, less capital expenditures. The presentation of free cash flow is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We use free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, both in presenting our results to stockholders and the investment community, and in our internal evaluation and management of the business. Management believes that this financial measure and the information we provide are useful to investors because they permit investors to view our performance using the same metric that we use to gauge progress in achieving our goals. Free cash flow is also an indication of cash flow that may be available to fund further investments in future growth initiatives. \nFor purposes of funding our acquisition of Code Red on February 6, 2015, we borrowed $35.0 million in the form of a Eurodollar rate loan (the Loan\u201d) under the Revolving Credit Facility. The proceeds of the Loan made under the Credit Agreement could be used for permitted acquisitions and general corporate purposes. On September 21, 2015, we amended the Credit Agreement to borrow an additional $265.0 million (the Second Amendment\u201d) in order to fund our acquisition of Portware, which closed on October 16, 2015. The maturity date on all outstanding loan amounts (which totaled $300.0 million as of August 31, 2016) is September 21, 2018. The Second Amendment also allows us, subject to certain requirements, to arrange for additional borrowings with the Lender for an aggregate amount of up to $400.0 million, provided that any such request for additional borrowings must be in a minimum amount of $25.0 million. On October 26, 2016, we borrowed an additional $65.0 million for general corporate purposes.\nExecutive Overview\n \u25cf Market Trends \nLong-lived assets, comprised of property, equipment and leasehold improvements are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may cause an impairment review include significant changes in technology that make current computer-related assets that we use in our operations obsolete or less useful and significant changes in the way we use these assets in our operations. When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment if impairment indicators are present, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value, which may be based on estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset's carrying value exceeds the asset's estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. The new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of that asset. Using the impairment evaluation methodology described here, there have been no long-lived asset impairment charges for each of the last three years. The carrying value of long-lived assets as of August 31, 2016 and 2015, was $84.6 million and $59.3 million, respectively.\nRevenues\nContractual Obligations\n (2) Purchase commitments represent payments due in future periods in respect of obligations to our various data vendors as well as commitments to purchase goods and services such as telecommunication and computer maintenance services. \nOperating Income and Operating Margin\n\nOur CTS suite of products, which provides solutions for our clients outside our terminal business, was a significant growth driver during fiscal 2016. There is an increased awareness of our CTS capabilities and data solutions to power workflows for the front and middle office. Clients are developing internal solutions to provide more customization and to help them target their customers and users more directly. Firms are coming to FactSet to integrate unique content and analytics into their client portals, customer relationship management, performance systems, quant and regulatory workflows. We license in feed form, including Fundamentals, Estimates, Transcripts and Ownership, among other offerings. The CTS suite includes a growing number of standardized data feeds that complement and mirror the data in the FactSet workstation.\n \u25cf Forward-Looking Factors \nApproximately 82.6% of our ASV is derived from our investment management clients. The prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management. An equity market decline not only depresses assets under management but could cause a significant increase in redemption requests. Moreover, extended declines in the equity markets may reduce new fund or client creation, resulting in lower demand for services from investment management clients. Our investment banking clients that perform M&A advisory work, provide capital markets services and equity research, account for approximately 17.4% of our ASV. A significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by the largest banks. Credit continues to impact many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations. Clients could encounter similar problems. A lack of confidence in the global banking system could cause declines in M&A funded by debt. Additional uncertainty, consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking sector could adversely affect our financial results and future growth. Regardless, the size of banks in general is shrinking as they deleverage their balance sheets and adjust their expense bases to future revenue opportunities. Our revenues may decline if banks, including those involved in recent merger activity, significantly reduce headcount in the areas of corporate M&A, capital markets and equity research to compensate for the issues created by other departments.\n\nFiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015\n\nPortware, acquired in October 2015, has maintained its strong track record of growth. We acquired Portware to expand our presence strategically in large global asset managers by becoming part of their trading ecosystem. Since the acquisition, Portware client volume has increased as have new client and broker connections. The integration of the Portware group into our organization has progressed smoothly. We continue to execute on the healthy pipeline of business from the close of the acquisition and have taken advantage of cross-selling the Portware solution to FactSet's client base.\n \u25cf Share Repurchase Program \nWe intend that all forward-looking statements we make will be subject to safe harbor protection of the federal securities laws as found in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements involve certain known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, those listed in Part 1 Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to update any of our forward-looking statements after the date of this Annual Report to reflect actual results or future events or circumstances.\nThe remaining 68,761 options are eligible to cliff vest based on a four-year measurement period ending February 28, 2019. As of August 31, 2016, total unamortized stock-based compensation of $0.7 million will be recognized as expense over the remaining vesting period of 2.4 years. A change, up or down, in the actual financial performance levels achieved by Code Red in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense:\n* Amounts represent the cumulative catch-up adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of August 31, 2016.\nCapital expenditures were $25.7 million during fiscal 2015, up from $17.7 million in fiscal 2014. Approximately $13.8 million, or 54%, of our capital expenditures during fiscal 2015 were for purchase of computer equipment, including more servers for our existing data centers, purchasing laptop computers and peripherals for employees, upgrading existing computer systems and improving telecommunication equipment. The remaining 46% of our capital expenditures were used to build out our offices primarily in New York, Texas and the Philippines during fiscal 2015.\nFree cash flow for fiscal 2015 was $280.8 million, exceeding net income by 16%. Free cash flow generated during fiscal 2015 was attributable to $241.1 million of net income, $37.6 million of positive working capital changes and $27.8 million in non-cash expenses less $25.7 million in capital expenditures. Working capital improvements were derived from lower income tax payments and increased accounts payable and accrued expenses due to the timing of payments partially offset by a rise in accounts receivable compared to the prior year. The rise in accounts receivable was due to our year over year revenue growth. Our accounts receivable balance as of August 31, 2015, rose by only 5.2% compared with August 31, 2014, while revenue growth grew by 9.4% year over year. This lesser percentage increase was primarily due to a decrease in our days sales outstanding ( DSO\u201d), which declined to 33 days as of August 31, 2015, compared to 34 days as of August 31, 2014.\n \u25cf Significant Accounting Policies \nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our tax provision is an estimate based on our understanding of laws in Federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions. These laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to any business including ours. The tax laws also require us to allocate our taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of state taxes, foreign operations, R&D and other tax credits, tax audit settlements, incentive-stock options and domestic production activities deductions. Our annual effective tax rate was 26.5%, 27.8% and 30.3% in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nBusiness Outlook\nLong-Term Debt\nASV from our U.S. operations was $754.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, up 8.3% organically from a year ago. International ASV totaled $395.5 million, up 10.7% organically from a year ago. ASV from our international operations represented 34.4% of our Company-wide total, its highest level in FactSet history. Our European organic ASV achieved a growth rate of 8.7% over the last 12 months while Asia Pacific organic ASV grew by 17.0%. We have seen notable wins in both the sovereign wealth and investment management space and growth globally, with the addition of new clients in all three segments.\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of August 31, 2016 and the corresponding effect that these obligations will have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\n\nLetters of Credit\nLiquidity\nAsia Pacific operating income increased 17.5% to $42.6 million compared to $36.3 million in fiscal 2014. The increase was due to incremental revenues of $8.2 million and the effects of favorable foreign currency fluctuations on our expense base, partially offset by higher employee compensation. The higher employee compensation costs were due an 11.0% increase in headcount from fiscal 2014.\nClient and User Additions\nSG&A expenses increased 1.9% to $269.5 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to $264.4 million in fiscal 2014. Expressed as a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses decreased 190 basis points to 26.8% in fiscal 2015 due to lower employee compensation and lower occupancy costs.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe make significant estimates in determining our accrued compensation. Approximately 15% of our total employee compensation is variable and discretionary. We conduct a final review of Company and departmental individual performance each year end to determine the amount of discretionary employee compensation. We also review compensation throughout the year to determine how overall performance tracks against management's expectations. Management takes these and other factors, including historical performance, into account in reviewing accrued compensation estimates on a quarterly basis and adjusts accrual rates as appropriate. As of August 31, 2016 and 2015 the amount of the variable employee compensation recorded within accrued compensation was $38.2 million and $38.6 million, respectively.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nEmployee compensation, including stock-based compensation, when expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 230 basis points in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. This increase was primarily due to new employees hired in the past year. Over the last 12 months, we have added 604 net new employees involved with content collection and 266 net new engineering and product development employees, as we continue to focus on servicing our existing client base, expanding our content and improving our applications. The increase in employee headcount includes 123 employees added from the Portware acquisition in cost of sales related roles. Amortization of acquired intangible assets, when expressed as a percentage of revenues, increased 50 basis points in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the addition of $75.5 million of intangible assets related to the acquisition of Portware. Computer-related expenses, which include depreciation, maintenance, software and other fees, increased 40 basis points when expressed as a percentage of revenues, as we require additional computer hardware and peripherals for new employees, upgrades to existing computer systems and the development of new internal systems to support our growing infrastructure.\nCost of Services\n* Amounts represent the cumulative catch-up adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of August 31, 2016.\n \u25cf GAAP operating margin is expected to range between 31.0% and 32.0%. Adjusted operating margin is expected to range between 32.5% and 33.5%. \nRevenues in fiscal 2016 were $1,127.1 million, up 12.0% compared to fiscal 2015. Our revenue growth drivers during fiscal 2016 were robust demand for our portfolio analytics ( PA\u201d) suite of products, including an expansion of our multi-asset class value added products, accelerated growth in our Content & Technology Solutions ( CTS\u201d), advancement in Workstation Solutions and significant progress in the Portware business, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency.\nOur impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. We have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.\n\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect our expectations as of September 27, 2016. Given the number of risk factors, uncertainties and assumptions discussed below, actual results may differ materially. We do not intend to update our forward-looking statements until our next quarterly results announcement, other than in publicly available statements.\nOn May 6, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a 13.6% increase in the regular quarterly dividend beginning with the dividend payment in June 2016 which was $0.50 per share, or $2.00 per share per annum. With our dividends and our share repurchases, in the aggregate, we have returned $431.0 million to shareholders over the past 12 months. Future cash dividends will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors we considered relevant and is subject to final determination by our Board of Directors.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\n \u25cf Critical Accounting Estimates \nOperating Income by Segment\n\nFiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015\nIn 2016, we sought to strengthen and expand our core business model. Our strategic acquisition of Portware in October 2015 has provided a new stream of revenue and growth. Portware revenues have grown in double-digits since the acquisition and Portware is now break-even on an earnings per share basis. Additionally, we sold our Market Metrics business in July 2016 and recognized an after-tax gain of $81.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The sale allowed us to sharpen our focus on our long-term growth drivers and our mission to deliver world-class insight and information through our analytics, service, content and technology.\nOperating income increased 5.4% to $349.7 million in fiscal year 2016 compared to the prior year. Our operating margin for fiscal 2016 was 31.0%, down from 33.0% a year ago. The lower operating margin was primarily due to Portware's operations, which reduced our operating margin by 120 basis points in fiscal 2016. Additionally, higher employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, reduced our operating margin collectively by 90 basis points. In fiscal 2016, we also incurred non-recurring charges of approximately $4.6 million related primarily to legal matters. Offsetting these drivers was organic revenue growth of 9.9% and lower occupancy costs.\n (2) ASV grew 8.8% organically year over year. Organic ASV excludes ASV from acquisitions and dispositions completed within the last 12 months and the effects of foreign currency. \nThe table below, for the periods indicated, provides selected cash flow information:\nIn fiscal 2016, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $232.3 million under the existing share repurchase program compared to 1.7 million shares for $252.8 million under the existing share repurchase program during fiscal 2015. In July 2016, we entered into an ASR Agreement to repurchase $120.0 million of our common stock. We received 595,607 shares of common stock on July 5, 2016, which was approximately 80% of the total number of shares of common stock expected to be repurchased under the ASR Agreement. The final settlement of the ASR Agreement occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with FactSet receiving an additional 102,916 shares of its common stock. In conjunction with the ASR Agreement, in May 2016, our Board of Directors approved a $165.0 million expansion of the existing share repurchase program. Including the expansion, $197.0 million remained available for future share repurchases as of August 31, 2016.\nIncome Taxes, Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share\nMarket Trends\nAs disclosed earlier in the Capital Resources section of this MD&A, we borrowed $35.0 million in the form of a Eurodollar rate loan to fund the acquisition of Code Red in February 2015, and $265.0 million in the form of a Eurodollar rate loan to fund the acquisition of Portware in October 2015. The maturity date on all outstanding loan amounts is September 21, 2018, and there are no prepayment penalties in the event that we elect to prepay the loan prior to its scheduled maturity date. The amount borrowed bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to the Eurodollar rate plus 0.75% and is reported as Long-term debt within our Consolidated Balance Sheet at August 31, 2016.\nRevenues from our U.S. segment increased 8.7% to $678.8 million in fiscal 2015 compared to $624.6 million in fiscal 2014. Our fiscal 2015 U.S. revenue growth rate of 8.7% reflected increases in the number of users and clients of FactSet within the U.S., a rise in sales of our PA suite of products, continued demand for our proprietary content, $5.2 million of incremental revenue from the acquisition of Code Red and a strong performance by our U.S. investment management sales team. Our U.S. buy-side sales team saw sustained demand for our fixed income portfolio products, multi-asset class risk and stress testing, attribution and publishing products. Revenues from our U.S. operations accounted for 67.4% of our consolidated revenues during fiscal 2015, down from 67.9% in fiscal 2014, as our international ASV growth rate surpassed our U.S. ASV growth rate by 150 basis points.\n \u25cf New Accounting Pronouncements \nFiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015\nNet cash used in investing activities was $64.9 million during fiscal 2015, a decrease of $5.8 million over fiscal 2014 due to a $12.1 million decrease in cash used in business acquisitions and a $1.7 million increase in proceeds from sales of short-term investments, net of purchases, partially offset by a $7.9 million increase in cash used for capital expenditures.\n (2) Total operating expenses in fiscal 2015 include an incremental $3.0 million from the vesting of performance-based equity instruments and $3.2 million related to changes in the senior leadership responsible for the Company's salesforce. Of this total, $3.8 million was reported within SG&A expenses with the remainder in cost of services. \n \u25cf Named as one of the Best Workplaces in France\u201d \nAnnual Subscription Value Growth\nPartially offsetting the growth in cost of services during fiscal 2015 was a reduction in computer depreciation expense, which decreased 20 basis points in fiscal 2015 compared fiscal 2014. This decrease was primarily due to the continued use of fully depreciated equipment and our transition to more efficient and cost-effective servers in our data centers.\nCapital Needs\nWe describe our significant accounting policies in Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 below.\nDividends\nWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. In addition, there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements.\n* Amounts represent the cumulative catch-up adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of August 31, 2016.\n \u25cf Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements \nFiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015\n \u25cf Liquidity \nFiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014\nFiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015\nAs of August 31, 2016, there were 65,655 professionals using FactSet, an increase of 3,450 users in fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2016, we added 116 net new clients, increasing the number of clients by 3.9% over the prior year. Our total client count was 3,092 as of August 31, 2016. This net number reflects a reduction of 41 clients due to the sale of the Market Metrics business. We continue to focus on expanding our current client base as it is essential to our long-term growth strategy and encourages incremental sales growth of workstations, applications and content at our existing clients.\nWe performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, consistent with previous years, at which time it was determined that there were no indications of impairment, with the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units significantly exceeding carrying value. The carrying value of goodwill as of August 31, 2016 and 2015, was $452.9 million and $308.3 million, respectively.\n (1) Included in net cash used in investing activities during each fiscal year reported. \nThe Asia Pacific revenue growth rate of 12.0% was primarily due to net new user and client growth, increased PA subscriptions and our proficiency in selling additional services to existing clients, partially offset by negative foreign currency impact attributable to the change in the value of the Japanese Yen compared to the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reduced our Asia Pacific growth rate by 350 basis points.\nOf the total grant, 68,761 performance-based options are eligible for vesting based on achieving the growth targets over a two year measurement period ending February 28, 2017. As of August 31, 2016, total unamortized stock-based compensation of $1.3 million will be recognized as expense over the remaining vesting period of 2.4 years. A change, up or down, in the actual financial performance levels achieved by Code Red in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense:\nPerformance-based Equity Awards\nRevenues from our U.S. segment increased 11.3% to $755.5 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $678.8 million a year ago. Our fiscal 2016 U.S. revenue growth rate of 11.3% reflects increases in the number of users and clients of FactSet within the U.S., predominantly at buy-side hedge fund and middle-market clients. Additionally, we recognized $21.9 million of incremental revenue from the acquisition of Portware. Revenues from our U.S. operations accounted for 67.0% of our consolidated revenues during fiscal 2016, down from 67.4% a year ago, as our international ASV growth rate surpassed our U.S. ASV growth rate by 200 basis points.\n \u25cf Key Metrics \nOur industry-leading customer care is largely due to the talent of our employee population. As of August 31, 2016, employee headcount was 8,375, up 13.8% from a year ago. Excluding the acquired Portware workforce and employees of the divested Market Metrics business, headcount increased 13.4% from a year ago. The increases were primarily in positions that differentiate us in the market - software engineering, client service and content. In order to optimize costs, we have invested in expanding our footprint and talent pool in India and the Philippines, where we now have a combined workforce of over 4,800. Additionally, in fiscal 2016, we opened offices in Melbourne, Australia and Los Angeles, California.\nClient Service / Consultants\nEducating our clients is also an important component of our service. Not only do we teach our users the nuances of our software and content offerings, but FactSet personnel are often thought-leaders in a particular area of financial modeling in our rapidly evolving industry. As a result, clients look to FactSet as a trusted partner to stay on the cutting edge of financial modeling and analysis. During fiscal 2016, over 1,600 clients attended live or online FactSet training sessions and we saw a 7% increase in online learning registration.\n \u25cf Dividends \nAs a testament to our broadening suite of premium products and the strength of our business and service model FactSet was awarded Best Overall Provider,\u201d \"Best Research Provider\" and \"Best Analytics Provider\" by Inside Market Data in May 2016,. We were also named the Best Data Analytics Provider\u201d by Waters Technology in July 2016. Other recognition included Best Research and Analytics Tool\u201d award for our wealth management tools at the annual Systems in the City Awards. Portware also earned Best Buy-side EMS\u201d for the third time and was included on Global Finance's first annual list of forex leaders, \"The Innovators 2015 - Foreign Exchange.\"\nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2017 Expectations\nFactSet is a leading provider of integrated financial information and big data analytical applications to the global investment community. We deliver insight and information to investment professionals through our analytics, service, content, and technology.

Investment management (buy-side) clients account for 82.6% of our annual subscription value and the remainder is derived from investment banking firms (sell-side) that perform mergers and acquisitions ( M&A\u201d) advisory work, capital markets services and equity research.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nCapital Resources\n (3) Represents the amount due under the Company's Loan under its Revolving Credit Facility. \nOur Workstation Solutions, including Research Management Solutions ( RMS\u201d), StreetAccount, Wealth Management and Sales & Trading, continued to be positive revenue growth drivers during fiscal 2016. RMS, which is comprised of our Internal Research Notes ( IRN\u201d) and Code Red products, provides a centralized database for collecting both internal and external research, as well as fast and efficient ways to store and retrieve notes and documents over a shared drive. Growth in our RMS suite was driven by the ongoing regulatory demand for transparency across an increasing number of workflows. Code Red, which we acquired in February 2015, has been a strong local solution supplement to our hosted IRN solution. In adding Code Red's product offering to FactSet's existing RMS, we have been able to offer an RMS for all our clients' workflows.\nPurchase orders do not necessarily reflect a binding commitment but are merely indicative of authorizations and intention to conclude purchases in the future. For the purpose of this tabular disclosure, purchase obligations for goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. It is expected that all the contractual obligations noted in the table will be funded from existing cash and cash flows from operations. Expected timing pertaining to the contractual obligations included in the table above has been estimated based on information currently available. The amounts paid and the timing of those payments may differ based on when the goods and services provided by our vendors to whom we are contractually obligated are actually received as well as due to changes to agreed-upon amounts for any of our obligations.\nForeign Currency Hedges\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Our MD&A is presented in the following sections:\nOf our total employees, 2,407 were located in the U.S., 849 in Europe and 5,119 in Asia Pacific. Approximately 55% of our employees were involved with content collection, 24% worked in product development, software and systems engineering, another 18% conducted sales and consulting services and the remaining 3% provided administrative support. We are proud to have received the following accolades during fiscal 2016:\n\nFiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014\nResults of Operations\nFor an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position as of the reporting date. Otherwise, no benefit can be recognized. The tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We will classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that we anticipate payment of cash within one year. Additionally, we accrue interest on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws. Interest is classified as income tax expense in the financial statements.\nEuropean revenues advanced 10.6% year over year which was attributable to increases in client and user counts, continued growth in ASV from European sell-side clients and robust sales of PA subscriptions, partially offset by the negative effects of foreign currency. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reduced our European growth rate by 40 basis points.\nForward-Looking Factors\nFiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014\n\nFiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014\n \u25cf British Pound Sterling - foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 50% of our British Pound Sterling exposure through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. \nOperating Expenses\nOn February 6, 2015, we entered into a Credit Agreement between FactSet, as the borrower, and Bank of America, N.A., as the lender (the Lender\u201d). At that date, the Credit Agreement provided for a $35.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), under which we could request borrowings. The Credit Agreement also allowed us to arrange for additional borrowings for an aggregate amount of up to $265.0 million, provided that any such request for additional borrowings was in a minimum amount of $25.0 million.\nRevenues in fiscal 2015 were $1,006.8 million, up 9.4% compared to fiscal 2014. Our revenue growth drivers during fiscal 2015 were increases in ASV, clients and users, accelerated demand for our fixed income portfolio products, portfolio analytics suite of products, sales of equity attribution and multi-asset class risk models, additional purchases of our Portfolio Services solutions, expansion of our proprietary content, and continued growth of our RMS offering.\nEuropean revenues advanced 10.4% year over year which was attributable to increases in client and user counts, increased sales of PA subscriptions and incremental Portware revenues of $7.3 million, partially offset by the negative effects of foreign currency. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reduced our European growth rate by 30 basis points.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $158.4 million in fiscal 2016, representing a $93.5 million increase from fiscal 2015. This increase was primarily due to our acquisition of Portware in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 which resulted in a net cash outflow of $262.9 million compared to a net cash outflow of $34.8 million for acquisitions occurring in fiscal 2015. Additionally, cash used in investing activities increased year over year due to an increase in capital expenditures, primarily due to the fit-out of new space in New York, Chicago and the expansion of our corporate headquarters in Norwalk. These cash outflows were partially offset by net proceeds of $153.1 million from the sale of our Market Metrics business and an increase in proceeds from the sales of investments (net of purchases) of $3.5 million year over year.\nLong-lived Assets\nFiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015\n \u25cf Ranked #41 on Great Place to Work\u00ae 2016 Best Workplaces in the U.K.\u201d The report highlighted our collaborative culture and marks our eighth appearance on the list. \n \u25cf Indian Rupee - foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 75% of our Indian Rupee exposure through the first quarter of fiscal 2019. \nSignificant progress in Portware\n \u25cf GAAP diluted EPS should range between $1.62 and $1.66. Adjusted EPS is expected to range between $1.68 and $1.72. The midpoint of the adjusted EPS range represents 14.5% growth over the prior year. \n \u25cf Capital Resources \nSignificant Accounting Policies\nAs of August 31, 2016, we maintained the following foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure:\nThe Asia Pacific revenue growth rate of 22.8% was primarily due to an increase in the number of workstations, advancement in our multi-asset class risk and analytics, as well positive growth in our fee business. Portware contributed $4.1 million in sales since its acquisition in fiscal 2016. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased our Asia Pacific growth rate by 90 basis points.\nRobust Demand for Analytics\nAnnual client retention as of August 31, 2016, was greater than 95% of ASV and 94% when expressed as a percentage of clients, consistent with the prior year, and despite market-related cancellations which impacted our ASV growth rates. Our retention success, demonstrating that a majority of our clients maintain their subscriptions to FactSet year over year, highlights the strength of our business model. August 31, 2016, our largest individual client accounted for 2% of total subscriptions, and annual subscriptions from our ten largest clients did not surpass 15% of total client subscriptions, consistent with August 31, 2015.\nReturning Value to Stockholders\nCapital Expenditures\nThe fiscal 2015 provision for income taxes was $92.7 million, up from $91.9 million in fiscal 2014. The 0.9% increase was due to a 10.0% increase in pre-tax income offset by the reenactment of the U.S. Federal R&D tax credit in December 2014. The reenactment of the credit was retroactive to January 1, 2014 and extended through the end of the 2014 calendar year. The reenactment resulted in a discrete income tax benefit of $5.1 million during fiscal 2015. Additionally, we recognized tax benefits of $3.7 million related to finalizing prior year tax returns and other discrete tax items.\nOn June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom ( UK\u201d) held a referendum in which British citizens approved an exit from the European Union ( EU\u201d), commonly referred to as Brexit.\u201d As a result of the referendum, the global markets and currencies have been adversely impacted, including a sharp decline in the value of the British Pound Sterling as compared to the U.S. dollar. Volatility in exchange rates is expected to continue in the short term as the UK negotiates its exit from the EU. We currently hedge approximately 50% of our British Pound Sterling exposure through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, thus reducing our currency risk. In the longer term, any impact from Brexit on us will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations. Although it is unknown what the result of those negotiations will be, it is possible that new terms may adversely affect our operations and financial results. While we evaluate our own risks and uncertainty related to Brexit, we will continue to partner with our clients to help them navigate the fluctuating international markets. Our products, including our datasets such as GeoRev, allow our clients to understand geographic exposure and assess the risks of operating on a global scale so they may make informed business decisions.\nOur reward for investing in a consulting group comprised of several hundred individuals is client loyalty, as evidenced by an annual client retention rate of greater than 95% of ASV as of August 31, 2016. Our consulting teams have been trained to listen to our clients' needs and transfer this knowledge directly to the product development teams, helping us transform suggestions into new or enhanced product offerings. In fiscal 2016, FactSet employees made over 45,000 client consulting visits, over 182,000 consulting calls and handled over 282,000 client questions. In addition, our new support desk in Manila, the Philippines handled over 5,000 client emails.\nAdditionally, in July 2016, we entered into an ASR Agreement to repurchase $120.0 million of our common stock. We received 595,607 shares of common stock on July 5, 2016 which was approximately 80% of the total number of shares of common stock expected to be repurchased under the ASR Agreement. The final settlement of the ASR Agreement occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, with FactSet receiving an additional 102,916 shares of its common stock. In conjunction with the ASR Agreement, in May 2016, our Board of Directors approved a $165.0 million expansion of the existing share repurchase program. Including the expansion, $197.0 million remained available for future share repurchases as of August 31, 2016. Combining our dividends and share repurchases, we returned $431.0 million to stockholders during fiscal 2016.\n\nAs of August 31, 2016, the fair value of our long-term debt was $300.0 million, which we believe approximates the carrying amount as the terms and interest rates approximate market rates given its floating interest rate basis.\nAs of August 31, 2016, we owed no commitment fees since we borrowed the full amount of the Credit Agreement. Other fees incurred, such as legal costs to draft and review the Credit Agreement, totaled less than $0.1 million and were capitalized as loan origination fees. These loan origination fees are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Loan (three years) using the effective interest method. The Credit Agreement contains covenants restricting certain FactSet activities, which are usual and customary for this type of loan.\nSG&A expenses increased 7.6% to $290.0 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $269.5 million in fiscal 2015. Expressed as a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses decreased 110 basis points to 25.7% in fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower employee compensation and lower occupancy costs, which include depreciation of furniture and fixtures, partially offset by expenses related to non-recurring legal matters and higher marketing costs.\nGoodwill is not amortized as it is estimated to have an indefinite life. At least annually, we are required to test goodwill at the reporting unit level for potential impairment, and, if impaired, write down to fair value based on the present value of discounted cash flows. Our reporting units evaluated for potential impairment were the U.S., Europe and Asia Pacific, which reflect the level of internal reporting we use to manage our business and operations. The three reporting units are consistent with the operating segments reported as there is no discrete financial information available for the subsidiaries within each operating segment. The impairment test requires management to make judgments in connection with these reporting units, including assigning assets, liabilities, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit.\nKey Metrics\nFiscal 2016 results continued our positive topline growth. Revenue was up 12.0% while annual subscription value ( ASV\u201d) increased 8.8% organically. This fiscal year marked our 38th year of operation, our 36th consecutive year of revenue growth and our 20th consecutive year of earnings growth as a public company. The pressures our clients have experienced in the past 12 months have not abated and we have dedicated ourselves to helping them navigate an uncertain environment. As of August 31, 2016, ASV totaled $1.15 billion, an increase of $92.0 million over the prior year. In addition, clients and users reached new highs of 3,092 and 65,655, respectively, in fiscal 2016. We returned $431.0 million to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, an increase of 33.5% over the prior year. This included $120.0 million relating to an accelerated share repurchase agreement ( ASR Agreement\u201d) which we entered into in July 2016.\nFiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014\n\nAccrued Compensation\nFiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015\nA client-centric approach has always been a key foundation of our success at FactSet. We support our powerful information and analytical applications with a team of financial data and modeling experts. Client satisfaction is a key metric by which we measure the success of our service. According to our fiscal 2016 global client satisfaction survey, 96% of respondents were satisfied or very satisfied with FactSet's support, consistent with the prior year. The depth of our knowledge, the data behind the models and the complex mathematics behind the answers each create an opportunity for us to forge close working relationships with our user community.\nDuring fiscal 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $91.0 million compared to $187.3 million in fiscal 2015. The year over year decrease in cash used was primarily due to proceeds from long-term debt of $265.0 million, offset by an increase in cash used in share repurchases of $100.6 million, lower proceeds and tax benefits from stock options exercised of $25.4 million, and an increase in payments of regular quarterly dividends of $7.7 million. The proceeds from long-term debt related to additional borrowings under the Second Amendment (defined in Capital Needs) to our credit agreement dated February 6, 2015 (the Credit Agreement\u201d) used to fund our acquisition of Portware on October 16, 2015. Cash used in share repurchases increased year over year as we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $232.3 million under the existing share repurchase program and 0.6 million shares for $120.0 million related to the ASR Agreement entered into in July 2016. We repurchased 1.7 million shares for $252.8 million in fiscal 2015 under the existing share repurchase program. Dividend payments increased as our Board of Directors approved a 13.6% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share, or $2.00 per share per annum, beginning with the dividend payment in June 2016.\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by numerous factors such as changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations of them. Significant judgment is required to determine recognition and measurement. Further, as a result of certain ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely affect our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\n (1) Operating lease amounts include future minimum lease payments under all our non-cancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year. For more information on our operating leases, see Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. \nNet income increased 13.9% to $241.1 million and diluted earnings per share increased 16.1% to $5.71 during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. Drivers of the increase in net income and earnings per share during fiscal 2015 included revenue growth of 9.4%, income tax benefits of $8.8 million, foreign currency benefits of $4.0 million and a decrease in diluted shares outstanding of 1.7%. These net income drivers were partially offset by incremental employee compensation expense within cost of services due to the hiring of 721 net new employees in fiscal 2015 and after-tax charges of $2.2 million and $2.1 million related to changes in the senior leadership of our sales teams and the vesting of performance-based equity instruments, respectively.\nJuly 2012 Performance-based Option Grant Review\n (2) We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities, which includes the cash cost for taxes and changes in working capital, less capital expenditures. \nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nCash and cash equivalents aggregated to $158.9 million or 21.6% of our total assets at August 31, 2015, compared with $116.4 million or 17.5% of our total assets August 31, 2014. Our cash and cash equivalents increased $42.5 million during fiscal 2015 due to cash provided by operations of $306.4 million, $71.5 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, $35.0 million in proceeds from long-term debt and $28.9 million in tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements. These cash inflows were partially offset by $34.8 million in cash paid to acquire businesses, $252.8 million in share repurchases, dividend payments of $66.6 million, capital expenditures of $25.7 million and purchases of investments, net of proceeds, of $4.4 million.\nThere were no other outstanding foreign currency forward contracts as of August 31, 2016. A loss on derivatives of $0.5 million was recorded into operating income during fiscal 2016, compared to a loss of $0.6 million in fiscal 2015.\nCertain wholly owned subsidiaries within the European and Asia Pacific segments operate under a functional currency different from the U.S. dollar. The financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses. Translation gains and losses that arise from translating assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders' equity.\nBusiness Combinations\nOverall, ASV growth for our buy-side business was 9.0%, down 40 basis points from the prior year period while our sell-side business experienced 7.6% growth, down 180 basis points from the prior year period. The decrease in the buy and sell-side growth rates can be attributed to an increase in market-related cancellations.\nAs of August 31, 2016, our non-U.S. dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized over the next 12 months were estimated to be $20.0 million while our non-U.S. dollar denominated expenses were estimated to be $213.3 million, which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of $193.3 million. Our foreign currency exchange exposure is related to our operating expense base in countries outside the U.S., where 71% of our employees were located as of August 31, 2016. During fiscal 2016, foreign currency movements decreased operating income by $11.6 million, compared to $11.2 million a year ago.\n \u25cf The annual effective tax rate is expected to range between 28.0% and 29.0%. \nDue to the global nature of our operations, we conduct business outside the U.S. in several currencies including the British Pound Sterling, Euro, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen and Philippine Peso. To the extent that our international activities increase in the future, our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase. To manage this exposure, we utilize derivative instruments (foreign currency forward contracts). By their nature, all derivative instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of market and credit risk. The market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. Credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposure to the counterparties associated with these instruments. Our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings associated with changes in foreign currency.\nFiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014\nOn August 5, 2016, we declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. The cash dividend of $20.0 million was paid on September 20, 2016, to common stockholders of record on August 31, 2016 using our existing cash generated by operations.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nIn connection with the acquisition of Code Red during the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we granted 137,522 performance-based stock options. These performance-based options are eligible to vest four years from date of grant if certain Code Red ASV and operating margin targets are achieved over the measurement period. The option holders must also remain employed by FactSet for the options to be eligible to vest.\nEstimated Tax Provision and Tax Contingencies\nAs of August 31, 2016, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling $8.8 million, including $1.3 million of accrued interest, recorded as Taxes Payable (non-current) within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions taken on tax returns but not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements. When applicable, we adjust the previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results when the position is effectively settled. If recognized, the unrecognized tax benefits and related interest would be recorded as a benefit to tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Audits by multiple tax authorities are currently ongoing. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. For this reason, we regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest.\nFiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014\n \u25cf Foreign Currency \nFiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015\n \u25cf Named as one of the 100 Best Workplaces for Women\u201d and Best Workplaces for Millennials\u201d in the U.S. by Great Place to Work\u00ae \nForeign Currency Exposure\nNet Income and Diluted Earnings per Share\nEmployee compensation, including stock-based compensation, when expressed as a percentage of revenues, decreased 130 basis points due to a higher percentage of our employee base working in a cost of services capacity versus SG&A. Of our total employee headcount increase in fiscal 2015, 84% was within our software engineering, content collection and product development teams, which are all included within cost of services. As such, SG&A employee compensation declined compared to the growth in cost of services. Occupancy costs, when expressed as a percentage of revenues, decreased 60 basis points, primarily due to furniture and leasehold improvements becoming fully depreciated, lower rent expense from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the timing of acquiring new real estate space. However, certain occupancy costs, such as rent, are temporary and are being driven by the timing of acquiring new space to support our growing employee population.\n2016 Year in Review\nFiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015\nWe granted 20,911 additional performance-based stock options to Portware employees in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Similar to the October 2015 grant, these performance-based options will vest 40% on the second anniversary date of the grant and 20% on each subsequent anniversary date if certain Portware revenue and operating income targets are achieved by October 16, 2017. The option holders must also remain employed by FactSet for the options to be eligible to vest. As of August 31, 2016, we do not believe these growth targets are probable of being achieved, and as such, no stock-based compensation expense is expected to be recognized in connection with these performance-based options. A change in the actual financial performance levels achieved by Portware in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense:\nFiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014\n* Amounts represent the cumulative catch-up adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of August 31, 2016.\nWe record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. All of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies and contingent consideration are recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date. The application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. Our estimates are based on historical experience, information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and when appropriate, includes assistance from independent third party appraisal firms. Our significant assumptions and estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $187.3 million during fiscal 2015. Of this total, $252.8 million related to the repurchase of 1.7 million shares under the existing share repurchase program and $66.6 million was for the payment of regular quarterly dividends. Partially offsetting these uses of cash were proceeds received from employee stock plans totaling $71.5 million, related tax benefits of $28.9 million and long-term debt of $35.0 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $89.4 million lower in the current year due to a $36.3 million increase in proceeds from employee stock option exercises and its related income tax benefits, proceeds from long-term debt of $35.0 million and a decrease in share repurchases of $23.6 million. These positive cash movements were partially offset by an incremental $5.5 million in dividend payments due to the 12.8% increase in our regular quarterly dividend, beginning in May 2015.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to financial risks involving the volatility of equity markets as well as foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.\nCost of services increased 14.6% to $405.3 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. Expressed as a percentage of revenues, cost of services was 40.3% in fiscal 2015, an increase of 190 basis points from fiscal 2014. The increase was driven by higher employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, partially offset by lower computer depreciation.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Portware during the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we granted 530,418 performance-based stock options. These performance-based options will vest 40% on the second anniversary date of the grant and 20% on each subsequent anniversary date if certain Portware revenue and operating income targets are achieved by October 16, 2017. The option holders must also remain employed by FactSet for the options to be eligible to vest. As of August 31, 2016, we do not believe these growth targets are probable of being achieved, and as such, no stock-based compensation expense is expected to be recognized in connection with these performance-based options. A change in the actual financial performance levels achieved by Portware in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense:\nImpact of Foreign Currency\nDuring fiscal years 2016 and 2015, our Board of Directors declared the following dividends:\nNet income increased 40.6% to $338.8 million and diluted earnings per share increased 43.4% to $8.19 during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. A large component of the increase in net income and diluted earnings per share during fiscal 2016 was an after-tax gain of $81.7 million related to the sale of the Market Metrics business. The gain increased diluted earnings per share by $2.01. Excluding the after-tax gain on sale, net income increased 6.7% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, while diluted EPS was $6.18. The increase year over year was primarily due to organic ASV growth of 8.8% and tax benefits of $10.5 million related to the permanent reenactment of the U.S. Federal R&D tax credit and finalizing prior years' tax returns and other discrete items. These increases were partially offset by incremental employee compensation expense due to the hiring of 1,015 net new employees (including 166 employees from acquisitions completed in the last 12 months). Additionally, Portware's operations reduced our operating margin by 120 basis points in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2016 we also incurred non-recurring charges of approximately $3.3 million, after-tax, related primarily to legal matters. During fiscal 2016, foreign currency movements increased operating income by $11.6 million compared to a benefit of $11.2 million in the same period of fiscal 2015.\nThe fiscal 2016 provision for income taxes was $122.2 million, up 31.8% from the same period a year ago. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company recognized tax expense of $30.8 million related to the gain on sale of the Company's Market Metrics business. Excluding tax expense from the gain, the provision for income taxes was $91.4 million in fiscal 2016, a decrease of 1.4% from fiscal 2015, primarily due to income tax benefits from the permanent reenactment of the U.S. Federal R&D Tax Credit in December 2015, finalizing prior year tax returns and other discrete items. Overall, we recognized income tax benefits of $10.5 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $6.5 million in the same period in fiscal 2015. Offsetting the tax benefits and excluding the gain on sale was an increase in taxable income of $14.8 million.\n (1) Total operating expenses in fiscal 2016 include $4.6 million related primarily to legal matters, $2.8 million from restructuring actions initiated by the Company and $1.8 million related to a change in the vesting of performance-based stock options. Of this total, $6.0 million was reported within SG&A expenses with the remainder in cost of services.
