Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk factors\u201d section of this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a pioneering clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on harnessing the power of the innate immune system by using the natural killer cell to treat cancer, infectious diseases and inflammatory diseases. Natural killer, or NK, cells are the body's first line of defense due to their innate ability to rapidly seek and destroy abnormal cells, such as cancer or virally-infected cells, without prior exposure or activation by other support molecules required to activate adaptive immune cells such as T-cells.\nWe believe that our proprietary NK cell line, coupled with our planned integrated discovery ecosystem, positions us to implement precision cancer medicine by leveraging the advances that have evolved during the past decade and addressing newly discovered challenges of cancer. Cancer is only recently understood to be a complex of rare diseases, with hundreds of patient-specific, cancer-promoting mutated proteins, some known and many more unknown called neoepitopes. Identifying and targeting these mutated proteins is our strategy to overcome the challenges of cancer in the era of genomics, transcriptomics and immuno-oncology. We believe neoepitopes, which are newly discovered antigens selectively expressed on the cancer cells and not on the essential normal tissue, represent large untapped targeting opportunities for immune effector cells such as our activated NK cells.\nMultiple Modes of Tumor Cell Killing. Our immuno-oncology NK platform has multiple modes to potentially induce cell death against the tumor or infected cell by: (1) direct killing by binding to stress ligands expressed by the diseased cell with the release of toxic granules directly into the tumor cell; (2) antibody mediated killing by binding to antibodies administered in combination and enhancing the cancer killing effect of the administered antibody, enabling targeted cell killing through antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity, or ADCC; and (3) target activated killing by binding to known or newly discovered tumor-specific antigens expressed on the surface of tumor cells and inducing cell death by the release of toxic granules directly into the tumor cell and by the release of cytokines and chemokines which recruit additional innate and adaptive immune responses, including the recruitment of cytotoxic T-cells.\nOur targeted therapeutic areas include: (1) cancer, focusing on bulky hematological cancers and solid tumors as well as cancer stem cells, (2) infectious diseases, including viral, fungal and bacterial infections, and (3) inflammatory diseases, ranging from rare inherited diseases to more prevalent autoimmune disorders.\nOur Integrated Discovery Ecosystem for Precision Medicine. In order to effectively target newly discovered neoepitopes, we plan to integrate the following ecosystem to help drive the development of genetically modified NK cells anticipated to be directed against these cancer-promoting mutated proteins: (1) a high-speed supercomputing infrastructure to help identify both known antigens on the surface of tumor cells and neoepitopes in clinical patients suffering from cancer, in a timely manner and at large scale; (2) a next-generation genomic and transcriptomic sequencing infrastructure to identify the expression of the neoepitopes on the surface of the tumor cell, GPS Cancer developed by our affiliate entity NantOmics; (3) delivering the neoepitope via an adenoviral vector developed by an affiliate entity to induce IgG1 in-vivo production and ADCC activity by our High Affinity NK Cell (haNK) (4) a diverse library of human antibodies from which to interrogate and extract an antibody matching the neoepitope; and (5) an aNK and haNK cell potentially capable of being produced as a scalable cell-based off-the-shelf\u201d therapy without the need for patient compatibility matching. We expect to regularly add newly discovered neoepitopes from our discovery engine, and we believe the thousands of newly discovered antigens selectively expressed on the cancer cells and not on the essential normal tissue will provide us with the ability to create new and targeted libraries of antibodies to be potentially delivered as living drugs for metastatic cancer cells and cancer stem cells.\nWe retain exclusive worldwide rights to clinical and research data, intellectual property and know-how developed with our aNK cells, as well as what we believe is the only clinical grade master cell bank of aNK cells in existence.\nSince our inception in 2002, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the discovery and development of our product candidates, including conducting clinical trials, and funding general and administrative support for these operations. To date, we have generated minimal revenue from non-exclusive license agreements with numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies granting the right to use our cell lines and intellectual property for non-clinical use. As described below, on June 9, 2015, we spun out these non-exclusive license agreements for non-clinical uses to Brink Biologics, Inc. (Brink Biologics) in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Brink Biologics, which were subsequently distributed by a dividend to our stockholders. We have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have incurred net losses in each year since our inception and, as of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $250.4 million. Our net losses were approximately $236.9 million and $6.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Substantially all of our net losses resulted from stock-based compensation expense and costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from selling, general and administrative costs associated with our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2015 we had 31 employees and currently, we have 41 employees. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we:\nTable 309: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> continue research and development, including preclinical and clinical development of our existing product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 310: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> potentially seek regulatory approval for our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 311: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> seek to discover and develop additional product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 312: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> establish a commercialization infrastructure and scale up our manufacturing and distribution capabilities to commercialize any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 313: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> seek to comply with regulatory standards and laws;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 314: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> maintain, leverage and expand our intellectual property portfolio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 315: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> hire clinical, manufacturing, scientific and other personnel to support our product candidates development and future commercialization efforts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 316: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 317: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating as a public company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, which we do not expect to happen for at least the next several years, if ever. Until such time that we can generate substantial revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operating activities through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition and could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our research and development programs or commercialization efforts. Failure to receive additional funding could cause us to cease operations, in part or in full.\nCollaboration Agreements\nWe anticipate that strategic collaborations will become an integral part of our operations, providing opportunities to leverage our partners' expertise and capabilities to further expand the potential of our technologies and product candidates. We believe we are well positioned to become a leader in cell-based immunotherapy due to our broad and vertically integrated platform and through complementary strategic partnerships.\nSorrento Therapeutics. In December 2014, we entered into a global/exclusive collaboration with Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc., or Sorrento, to jointly develop taNK product candidates as may be agreed between the parties. This transaction allows us to leverage Sorrento's proprietary G-MAB technology platform, one of the largest fully human antibody libraries in the world, to source CARs for our taNK product candidates. The economics from each product candidate will be dependent on the proportion of the development costs that each party contributes. As of the date hereof, the parties have not yet agreed upon any projects under the Joint Development and License Agreement; therefore Sorrento has no rights to use our NK cells or other technologies or intellectual property rights or to begin related research, development or commercialization activities and we are free to pursue, and are actively pursuing, research, development and commercialization activities with antibodies that may bind to various targets, including PDL1, ROR-1, CD33 and CD123.\nAgreements with Affiliates of NantWorks\nIn June 2015, we spun out Brink Biologics, Inc., or Brink Biologics, and Coneksis, Inc., or Coneksis. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has a controlling interest in Brink Biologics and Coneksis. For a description of each of these transactions see the disclosure under Spin-Out of Testing and Diagnostic Products and Services\u201d and Spin-Out of Veterinary Oncology Rights\u201d below.\nOur Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Soon-Shiong, founded and has a controlling interest in NantWorks, LLC (NantWorks), which is a collection of multiple companies in the healthcare and technology space. We have entered into arrangements with certain affiliates of NantWorks described below that, taken together, we expect will facilitate the development of new genetically modified NK cells for our product pipeline.\nIn June 2015, we entered into an agreement with NantOmics, LLC, or NantOmics, to obtain genomic sequencing and proteomic analysis services, as well as related data management and bioinformatics services, exclusively from NantOmics. We will have rights to use the data and results generated from NantOmics' services in connection with the performance of the particular oncology trial with respect to which the services were performed, but NantOmics will own the data and results, as well as any other intellectual property it creates in performing these services for us. We are obligated to pay NantOmics a fixed, per sample fee, determined based on the type of services being provided. The agreement has an initial term of five years and renews automatically for successive one year periods, unless terminated by us or NantOmics. We and NantOmics have the right to terminate the agreement for convenience on 90 days prior written notice, or in the event there is a material, uncured breach of the agreement by the other party.\nIn June 2015, we entered into an agreement with NanoCav, LLC, or NanoCav, pursuant to which we obtained access to NanoCav's virus-free cell transfection technologies on a non-exclusive basis. Under the agreement, NanoCav will conduct certain, mutually-agreed feasibility studies, on a fee for service basis, to evaluate the use of its cell transfection technologies with our aNK cells. We may elect to obtain NanoCav's cell transfection equipment, and rights to its associated protocols and other intellectual property, for use only for pre-clinical research, or also for use in clinical and commercial applications. If we choose to qualify the equipment and technologies for current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, use with our products, we are obligated to pay NanoCav an annual license fee, which is determined based upon whether we elect to use NanoCav's technologies for pre-clinical purposes only, or also for clinical and commercial purposes. In addition, if we use the equipment for clinical and commercial purposes, we are obligated to pay an equipment fee on a cost-plus basis. We are also obligated to purchase any consumables we require to use with the NanoCav technologies from NanoCav, and to pay for those consumables on a cost-plus basis. We have made a feasibility study retainer payment of $45,000. The agreement has an initial term of five years and renews automatically for successive one year periods, unless terminated. We have the right to terminate the agreement for convenience on 90 days prior written notice, and both NanoCav and we may terminate if there is a material, uncured breach of the agreement by the other party.\nIn June 2015, we also entered into a supply agreement with NantCell, Inc., or NantCell pursuant to which we have the right to purchase NantCell's proprietary bioreactors, made according to specifications we mutually agree with NantCell, in such quantities as we may require from time to time during the term of the agreement. We also have the right to purchase reagents and consumables associated with such equipment from NantCell. We made a non-refundable upfront payment to NantCell of $0.5 million, which is creditable against our future equipment purchases under the agreement. We are also obligated to pay for any equipment and consumables we purchase from NantCell on a cost-plus basis. The agreement has an initial term of five years and renews automatically for successive one year periods unless terminated by us or NantCell. We and NantCell have the right to terminate the agreement for convenience on 90 days prior written notice, or in the event there is a material, uncured breach of the agreement by the other party.\nIn November 2015, we entered into a shared services agreement with NantWorks under which NantWorks will provide corporate, general and administrative, manufacturing strategy, regulatory and clinical trial strategy and other support services to us. We will be charged for the services at cost plus reasonable allocations for indirect costs that relate to the employees providing the services. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded operating expenses of $0.3 million to research and development and $1.0 million to selling, general and administrative on the consolidated statement of operations under this arrangement.\nIn November 2015, we entered into a facility license agreement with NantWorks, effective in May 2015, for approximately 9,500 square feet of office space in Culver City, California, which is to be converted to a research and development laboratory and a Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, laboratory. The term of the license extends through December 2020. We have the option to extend the license through December 2023. The monthly license fee is $47,000 with annual increases of three percent (3%) beginning in January 2017. Additional terms for the license shall be determined at fair market value. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded rent expense of $0.2 million, included in research and development on the consolidated statement of operations.\nUnder the facility license agreement with NantWorks, we are responsible for costs to build out the laboratory and have incurred costs of approximately $2.0 million as of December 31, 2015 which are reflected as construction in progress. Additionally, in order for the facility to meet our research and development and GMP laboratory specifications, we have made structural changes as part of the conversion from office to laboratory space, and as a result, have concluded that we are deemed owner\u201d of the building (for accounting purposes only) during the construction period. Accordingly, we recorded a non-cash build-to-suit lease asset of $2.7 million on the consolidated balance sheet, representing its estimate of the fair market value of the building, and a corresponding construction build-to-suit lease liability.\nSpin-Out of Testing and Diagnostic Products and Services\nOn June 9, 2015, we spun out our business relating to testing and diagnostic products and services to Brink Biologics in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Brink Biologics. We subsequently distributed the shares of Brink Biologics by a dividend to our stockholders of record on June 9, 2015, on a pro rata basis. Under the spin-out arrangement, we transferred to Brink Biologics all of our existing, revenue-earning, non-exclusive license agreements that allow third parties to use our cell lines and intellectual property for non-clinical laboratory testing, and also transferred or licensed to Brink Biologics our other assets pertaining to testing and diagnostics products and services. Our board of directors determined that our strategic focus is to utilize our resources to pursue the potential treatment of cancer, infectious diseases and inflammatory diseases, rather than to utilize our resources and intellectual property to focus on non-clinical laboratory testing for minimal revenue opportunities as compared to the potential market opportunity that may exist for our therapeutic focus. We granted to Brink Biologics worldwide, exclusive licenses, for use only in the field of in vitro and in vivo testing and diagnostic products and services and under certain cell lines, trademarks, know-how and patents, including the intellectual property rights licensed to us under our license agreement with Fox Chase Cancer Center. Brink Biologics is restricted in its ability to modify the licensed cell lines, and we will have at least joint ownership of any such modifications and the ability to use those modifications outside Brink Biologics' field. We also have a non-exclusive license to any results and data arising from Brink Biologics' use of our cell lines and intellectual property for our use for internal research purposes and outside of Brink Biologics' field. In consideration for the license grants, Brink Biologics is obligated to pay us a low single-digit royalty on amounts received for the sale of licensed products and services, as well as a low single-digit percentage share of other revenue received by Brink Biologics from the grant of sublicenses under our rights. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded $11,000 in revenue for royalties. Brink Biologics has the right to terminate the license agreement for convenience. We have the right to terminate the license agreement if Brink Biologics challenges any of our patents or the patents licensed to us by Fox Chase Cancer Center. We and Brink Biologics each have the right to terminate the license agreement if the other party is dissolved or is declared bankrupt, or remains in breach of any material obligation following a sixty day cure period to remedy the breach. Also, as part of the spin-out arrangement, we have agreed to provide certain services to Brink Biologics for a transitional period on a fee-for-service basis. As of December 31, 2015, we invoiced Brink Biologics for service fees in the amount of $22,000 which is recorded in other income on our consolidated statements of operations. Had we consummated the spin-out as of the beginning of the year, for the year ended December 31, 2015, our revenue would have been $26,000 and selling, general and administrative expense would still have been $227.7 million. There is no impact to our consolidated balance sheet because the spin-out occurred at the beginning of June. Accordingly, it is already reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. We further determined that we have a variable interest in Brink Biologics through our royalty agreement with them. However, we are not the primary beneficiary, and as such, do not consolidate the entity.\nSpin-Out of Veterinary Oncology Rights\nOn June 9, 2015, we spun out our business relating to veterinary oncology to Coneksis in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Coneksis. We subsequently distributed the shares of Coneksis by a dividend to our stockholders of record on June 9, 2015, on a pro rata basis. In connection with the spin-out arrangement, we granted to Coneksis worldwide, exclusive licenses, for use only in the field of veterinary medical research and therapeutics, under certain cell lines, trademarks, know-how and patents, including the intellectual property rights licensed to us under our license agreement with Fox Chase Cancer Center. Like Brink Biologics, Coneksis is restricted in its ability to modify the licensed cell lines, and we will have at least joint ownership of any such modifications and the ability to use those modifications outside Coneksis' field. We also have a non-exclusive license to any results and data arising from Coneksis' use of our cell lines and intellectual property for our use for internal research purposes and outside of Coneksis' field. In consideration for the license grants, Coneksis is obligated to pay us a low single-digit royalty on amounts received for the sale of licensed products and services, as well as a low single-digit percentage share of other revenue received by Coneksis from the grant of sublicenses under our rights. Coneksis has the right to terminate the license agreement for convenience. We have the right to terminate the license agreement if Coneksis challenges any of our patents or the patents licensed to us by Fox Chase Cancer Center. We and Coneksis each have the right to terminate the license agreement if the other party is dissolved or is declared bankrupt, or remains in breach of any material obligation following a sixty day cure period to remedy the breach. Finally, as part of the spin-out arrangement, we have agreed to provide certain services to Coneksis for a transitional period on a fee-for-service basis. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we invoiced Coneksis for service fees in the amount of $6,000 which is recorded in other income on our consolidated statements of operations. Had we consummated the spin-out as of the beginning of the year, there would have been no material impact to our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015, or our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. We further determined that we have a variable interest in Coneksis through our royalty agreement with them. However, we are not the primary beneficiary, and as such, do not consolidate the entity.\nInex Bio Acquisition\nIn April 2012, we made a strategic decision to enter into a License Agreement, or the Inex License Agreement, with Inex Bio, Inc. or Inex Bio, a Republic of Korea corporation. Under the Inex License Agreement, we provided Inex Bio with an exclusive license to our technology to be used in products only in certain Asian countries. In exchange for the exclusive license, we received a $0.3 million up-front license fee. In addition, we are entitled to receive milestone payments of up to $0.8 million based upon the completion of certain clinical trials and a 5% royalty on the net sales of applicable products using our aNK cells. No milestone payments or royalties have ever been due or received under this agreement.\nIn May 2012, we acquired 57,000 shares of Inex Bio for $0.2 million, which represented 22.2% of the outstanding shares and 17.4% of the fully-diluted shares of Inex Bio. At that time, Inex Bio had only one other stockholder and one option holder.\nIn February 2015, following Dr. Soon-Shiong and Dr. Henry Ji, one of our former directors, joining us, we determined that reacquiring the rights licensed in certain Asian countries was of strategic importance to our future potential commercial strategy. Drs. Soon-Shiong and Ji, one of our former directors, helped facilitate our reacquisition of these rights through the acquisition of Inex Bio, using their relationships with the other Inex Bio stockholders. Drs. Soon-Shiong and Ji facilitated the acquisition through the formation of Inex Bio Holdings, LLC, or Inex Bio Holdings, which purchased shares of Inex Bio from third party stockholders. Following this acquisition, Cambridge Equities, LP, an entity of which Dr. Soon-Shiong is the sole member of its general partner, and Eragon Ventures, LLC, an entity of which Dr. Ji was the managing member, each owned fifty percent (50%) of InexBio Holdings.\nIn February and March 2015, InexBio Holdings paid $1.1 million in cash to the third party stockholders to acquire a 67.3% interest in Inex Bio. Following this transaction, we owned a 22.2% interest in Inex Bio, InexBio Holdings owned a 67.3% interest in Inex Bio and the third party stockholders held the remainder of the Inex Bio shares. We believed that it was in our best interest for InexBio Holdings to acquire the shares directly from the third party stockholders of Inex Bio because of Dr. Soon-Shiong's and Dr. Ji's relationships with the stockholders and our belief that this would be the quickest manner to effect the acquisition and at the lowest price.\nOn March 30, 2015, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with InexBio Holdings and certain other parties, or the purchase agreement, pursuant to which we acquired all the remaining outstanding shares of Inex Bio not previously owned by us for cash consideration of $8.0 million and the issuance of a warrant to purchase 3,202,593 shares of our Class A common stock at an exercise price of $2.00 per share. We paid (1) $1.5 million in cash and warrants to purchase 593,072 shares of our Class A common stock valued at approximately $5.2 million to the third party stockholders; and (2) $6.5 million of cash and warrants to purchase 2,609,520 shares of our Class A common stock valued at $22.7 million to Inex Bio Holdings. The purpose of providing the warrants was primarily to avoid having to use additional cash consideration for the acquisition. In addition, the subsequent exercise of the warrants by InexBio Holdings and other former shareholders of Inex Bio provided us with additional cash to fund our own operations. At the time of our acquisition of the remaining shares of Inex Bio, Dr. Simon, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and one of our former directors, was on the board of directors of Inex Bio. Subsequent to the closing of the transaction, InexBio Holdings exercised the warrant we issued in connection with the transaction for 2,609,520 shares of our common stock for aggregate cash consideration to us of $5.2 million.\nDuring the second quarter of 2015, due to the price at which our common stock sold in a series of private placement transactions, we retroactively reassessed the estimated fair value per share of our common stock for financial reporting purposes. As a result of its reassessment, we determined that, solely for financial reporting purposes, the fair value of its common stock was higher than the fair market values determined in good faith by our board of directors for each of the option grant dates from and after January 2015. The exercise price of $2.00 per share for the warrants issued to InexBio Holdings in March 2015 was based upon the fair market value determined in good faith by our board of directors. As a result of the retroactive reassessment in the second quarter of 2015, the issuance of the warrants resulted in compensation expense to Dr. Soon-Shiong and to Dr. Ji of $22.7 million.\nComponents of our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nTo date, we have derived substantially all of our revenue from non-exclusive license agreements with numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies granting them the right to use our cell lines and intellectual property for non-clinical use. These agreements generally include upfront fees and annual research license fees for such use, as well as commercial license fees for sales of our licensee's products developed or manufactured using our intellectual property and cell lines. Our license agreements may also include milestone payments, although to date, we have not generated any revenue from milestone payments. We recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or we have provided the service, the fees are fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We expect our revenue from non-clinical license agreements to decrease to a nominal amount in the future as we have transferred virtually all of our revenue-generating license agreements to Brink Biologics in the spin-out transaction described above. In the future, we may generate revenue from license agreements entered into for therapeutic uses. To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales. If we fail to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner or fail to obtain regulatory approval for them, we may never be able to generate substantial future revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nWe classify our operating expenses into research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs including salaries, benefits, bonuses and specifically stock-based compensation expense comprise a significant component of our research and development and selling, general and administrative expense categories. We allocate expenses associated with our facilities and information technology costs between these two categories based on the nature of each cost.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense consists of expenses incurred while performing research and development activities to discover and develop our product candidates. This includes conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, manufacturing development efforts and activities related to regulatory filings for product candidates. We recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred. Our research and development expense primarily consists of:\nTable 318: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> clinical trial and regulatory-related costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 319: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> expenses incurred under agreements with investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 320: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> manufacturing and testing costs and related supplies and materials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 321: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 322: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> facility expenses dedicated to research and development.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe typically use our employee, consultant and infrastructure resources across our development programs. We track outsourced development costs by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs, other internal costs or external consultant costs to specific product candidates or development programs.\nSubstantially all of our research and development expenses to date have been incurred in connection with our product candidates. We expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as we advance an increased number of our product candidates through clinical development, including the conduct of our planned clinical trials. The process of conducting clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming. The successful development of product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing or costs required to complete the remaining development of any product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of product candidates.\nThe costs of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project owing to, but not limited to, the following:\nTable 323: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> per patient trial costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 324: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the number of sites included in the clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 325: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the countries in which the clinical trials are conducted;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 326: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 327: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the number of patients that participate in the clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 328: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the number of doses that patients receive;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 329: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the cost of comparative agents used in clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 330: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 331: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 332: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the duration of patient follow-up; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 333: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe do not expect any of our product candidates to be commercially available for at least the next several years, if ever.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel-related costs, including employee benefits and any stock-based compensation, for employees performing functions other than research and development. This includes personnel in executive, finance, human resources and administrative support functions. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs not otherwise allocated to research and development expense, professional fees for auditing, tax and legal services, advertising costs, expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining patents, consulting costs, royalties and licensing costs, and costs of our information systems.\nWe expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase for the foreseeable future as we expand operations, internalize the manufacturing of our product candidates (including costs related to building out a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility as well as hiring additional employees to support our manufacturing and processing department), and operate as a public reporting company (including increased fees for outside consultants, lawyers and accountants, as well as increased directors' and officers' liability insurance premiums). We have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur in the future additional costs associated with operating as a public company, including costs to comply with stock exchange listing and SEC requirements, corporate governance, internal controls, investor relations, disclosure and similar requirements applicable to public companies. Additionally, if and when we believe that a regulatory approval of a product candidate appears likely, we expect to incur significant increases in our selling, general and administrative expenses relating to the sales and marketing of the approved product candidate.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) consists primarily of income from our investments in marketable securities, non-cash costs related to fair value adjustments to our derivative warrant liability, debt discount to interest expense, equity in loss of Inex Bio, and foreign currency transaction expense. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded investment income from cash received for interest, dividends and realized gains on the sale of equity securities of $ 3.0 million, which was partially offset by $38,000 of non-cash costs related to the amortization of our investment net premium position. We were also relieved of our note payable outstanding as of December 31, 2014. The relief of debt is recorded in other income (expense).\nIn 2010, we issued, in conjunction with a termination and release agreement, a warrant to purchase 114,822 shares of Class A common stock. We accounted for the warrant as a derivative liability, which was adjusted to fair value each reporting period. The warrant was exercised in April 2015 and the derivative liability was reclassified to additional paid-in capital.\nIncome Tax\nIncome tax expense consists of U.S. federal and state income taxes as well as deferred tax benefits. To date, we have not been required to pay U.S. federal income taxes because of our current and accumulated net operating losses. Our income tax expense to date relates to income taxes in the states of California and New Jersey. Our tax benefit relates to Korea and the Inex Bio acquisition.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013\nTable 334: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

31, 2014 and 2013, have been retrospectively adjusted to apply a change in the method of accounting for patent costs we adopted on December 31, 2015. See Note 15 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nRevenue\nRevenue decreased $0.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was attributable to earning $0.2 million in commercial license fees associated with one of our licensees' first commercial sale of a product developed using our intellectual property and cell lines in 2014 that did not re-occur in 2015. Additionally, $0.2 million of the decrease was attributable to the transfer to Brink Biologics at the beginning of June 2015 of all of our then-existing, revenue-earning, non-exclusive license agreements that allow third parties to use our cell line and intellectual property for non-clinical laboratory testing as discussed above under the heading Spin-Out of Testing and Diagnostic Products and Services.\u201d As a result of this spin-out, we will no longer receive revenue from these agreements.\nRevenue increased $41,000 during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to earning a $0.2 million commercial license fee associated with one of our licensees' first commercial sale of a product developed using our intellectual property and cell lines. This increase was partially offset by a $0.1 million decrease in upfront and annual research license fees during the year ended December 31, 2014, due primarily to the timing of revenue recognition and a net decrease in the number of license agreements.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense increased $9.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to $2.5 million in laboratory and clinical trial expenses, $1.7 million in compensation expense related to increased staff, consultant costs, and shared services, $1.6 million for new lab and manufacturing facility expenses, $1.5 million payment for initial license fees under a license agreement, $1.3 million in amortization of intangible assets from the Inex Bio acquisition, and $1.1 million for stock compensation expense related to consultants and an increase in staffing. We expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as we advance an increased number of our product candidates through clinical development and conduct our planned clinical trials.\nResearch and development expense increased by $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily attributable to a $0.6 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs due to an increase in headcount of our research and development personnel, a $0.4 million increase in laboratory and clinical trials expenses and a $0.1 million increase in rent expense for our research and development facilities.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased $223.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to $209.3 million in stock compensation expense, of which $141.9 million is related to service and performance based criteria applicable to a warrant granted to Dr. Soon-Shiong, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Warrant Agreement, or the Warrant Agreement. The stock compensation expense related to the Warrant Agreement includes $114.5 million for the achievement of a financing transaction with a strategic partner, which triggered the vesting of 8,331,750 warrant shares in the second quarter of 2015, $22.9 million related to service-based vesting and $4.5 million related to another performance milestone where achievement is deemed probable. In addition to the impact of the Warrant Agreement, the increase in stock compensation included $38.2 million related to stock options and restricted stock units, or RSUs, also granted to our Dr. Soon-Shiong and to Dr. Simon, our President and Chief Operating Officer, $22.7 million related to grants to Dr. Soon-Shiong and a former director for their assistance in connection with the asset purchase of Inex Bio and $6.5 million related to stock options and RSUs issued to employees and non-employees. We expect our stock based compensation expense included in selling, general, and administrative expense to decrease significantly for the foreseeable future.\nIn addition, there were increases of $8.1 million in salaries, personnel-related and shared service costs, of which $5.4 million is cash consideration paid to our CEO and a former director in association with the acquisition of Inex Bio, $1.6 million is related to an increase in staffing, and $1.0 million is related to shared service costs. There were also increases in expenses of $2.1 million for legal costs primarily to protect and maintain our patents and a $1.4 million increase related to becoming and operating as a public company including director and office insurance premiums, legal fees and registration fees. There was also an increase of $1.2 million for accounting and public relations services as well as $1.0 million in increased travel expenses. These increases were partially offset by a $0.2 million decrease in royalties and cost of licensing, which was primarily attributable to the transfer of the majority of our existing revenue-earning, non-exclusive license agreements that allow third parties to use our cell line and intellectual property for non-clinical laboratory testing to Brink Biologics at the beginning of June 2015.\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased by $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $1.9 million in salaries and personnel-related costs as we prepared to file our registration statement and operate as a public company. Patent filing expenses increased by $0.2 million as we continued to apply for patent protection for our product candidates. Additionally, royalties and cost of licensing increased $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in royalty payments under our in-licensing agreements during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income increased $2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to a $3.0 million increase in investment income related to a realized gain of $2.5 million from the sale of equity securities and a $0.5 million increase in dividend and interest income. There was also a reduction of $0.5 million in interest expense as the Company paid off all its debt in 2014. This decrease in expense was partially offset by an increase in the fair value adjustment of $1.2 million related to our derivative warrant liability.\nOther expense increased by $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This change was primarily attributable to a $0.8 million increase in the fair value adjustment related to our derivative warrant liability.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense, Net\nIncome tax (benefit) expense increased by ($0.3) million during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was attributable to income tax benefits related to losses at InexBio.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $175.9 million compared to $59.1 million as of December 31, 2014. In addition, investments in marketable securities were $173.4 million, of which $118.3 million were short-term investments as compared to no marketable securities as of December 31, 2014.\nRecent Equity Transactions\nIn November 2015, the board of directors approved a share repurchase program allowing our Chief Executive Officer or our Chief Financial Officer, on behalf of the Company, to repurchase from time to time, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, up to $50 million of our outstanding shares of common stock, exclusive of any commissions, markups or expenses. The timing and amounts of any purchases will be based on market conditions and other factors, including price, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations. The program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares and may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time without prior notice. We expect to finance the purchases with existing cash balances. No shares were repurchased as of December 31, 2015.\nFrom June 10, 2015 through July 8, 2015, we raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately $78.0 million from the sale of common stock in a series of private placement transactions to third parties. On June 18, 2015, we repurchased 249,952 shares of common stock from an employee at $19.20 per share for approximately $4.8 million.\nOn July 31, 2015, we closed the initial public offering, or IPO, of 9,531,200 shares of common stock in which we raised proceeds of $221.5 million after underwriters' discounts and commissions and offering expenses. Concurrently with our initial public offering, we completed a separate private offering of 680,000 shares of common stock in which we raised net proceeds of $17.0 million.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our primary sources and uses of cash the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nTable 335: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (As Adjusted) (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (As Adjusted) (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (25,305\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5,418\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (668\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (175,224\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (235\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 317,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 116,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 58,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Amounts reflected in the table for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, have been retrospectively adjusted to apply a change in the method of accounting for patent costs we adopted on December 31, 2015. See Note 15 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nOperating Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our net cash used in operating activities of $25.3 million consisted of a net loss of $236.9 million, primarily attributable to $211.2 million in stock compensation expense, $5.4 million cash compensation expense to our Chief Executive Officer and a former director in association with the acquisition of Inex Bio, as well as increases in legal expenses primarily to protect and maintain our patents and spending on research and development efforts. This was partially adjusted by $211.3 million for non-cash items and $0.3 million of cash provided in changes in working capital. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of the $211.2 million in stock-based compensation, $1.5 million in depreciation and amortization, and $1.4 million change in fair value of our derivative warrant liability, partially offset by $2.5 million gain on sales of marketable securities and $0.3 million in a deferred tax benefit. Changes in working capital consisted primarily of increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $2.6 million, due to related parties of $1.4 million and $0.9 million of deferred rent partially offset by an increase of $4.5 million of other current and non-current assets and $0.1 million decrease in deferred revenue.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, our net cash used in operating activities of $5.4 million consisted of a net loss of $6.2 million, primarily attributable to an increase in spending on research and development efforts and selling, general and administrative expenses, and $0.8 million of cash used to fund changes in working capital, partially adjusted by $1.6 million for non-cash items. Changes in working capital consisted primarily of a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $0.7 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $0.8 million of stock-based compensation expense, $0.4 million of amortization of the debt discount, and a change in fair value of our derivative warrant liability of $0.2 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, our net cash used in operating activities of $0.7 million consisted of a net loss of $2.0 million, primarily attributable to our spending on research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses, partially adjusted by $0.5 million for non-cash items and $0.9 million of cash provided by changes in working capital. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $0.9 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.3 million of amortization of the debt discount, partially offset by the change in fair value of our derivative warrant liability of $0.7 million. Changes in working capital consisted primarily of an increase in accounts payable of $0.7 million.\nInvesting Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $175.2 million, which was primarily attributable to $198.1 million of purchases of marketable securities, $2.2 million purchase of property and equipment, primarily related to our laboratory and GMP build out in Culver City, California, and a $1.8 million purchase of the remaining equity interest from unrelated third parties in Inex Bio. This was partially offset by $26.9 million in sales of equity investments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, net cash used in investing activities was $0.2 million and $3,000, respectively, which was attributable to the purchase of property and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $317.3 million, which consisted mainly of $316.5 million in net proceeds from our equity offerings, consisting of $221.5 million from our IPO, $78.0 million from a pre-IPO stock issuance, and $17.0 million from a private stock placement concurrent with the IPO. Additionally, $7.3 million in cash was provided from the exercise of warrants ($5.2 million of which were issued in conjunction with the acquisition of Inex Bio), and $0.9 million from the exercise of stock options. This was partially offset by a $4.8 million payment to repurchase shares of our common stock from an employee and $2.4 million of payroll taxes related to net share settlement of RSUs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was $64.4 million and consisted of $63.1 million of net proceeds from our debt and equity offerings, $1.2 million in payments received for prior issuance of Class B common stock and $0.2 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $0.1 million related to payments on the notes payable.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash provided by financing activities consisted of $0.7 million in net proceeds from our debt and equity offerings and $0.2 million in payments received for prior issuance of Class B common stock.\nFuture Funding Requirements\nTo date, we have generated minimal revenue from non-exclusive license agreements with numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies granting the right to use our cell lines and intellectual property for non-clinical use for laboratory testing that were spun out to Brink Biologics on June 9, 2015. We have not generated any revenue from product sales. We do not expect to generate significant revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize any of our product candidates and we do not know when, or if, this will occur. In addition, we expect our expenses to significantly increase in connection with our ongoing development activities, particularly as we continue the research, development and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates. Moreover, since the completion of our IPO in July 2015, we have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur in the future additional costs associated with operating as a public company. In addition, subject to obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses for product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. We anticipate that we will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. We expect that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:\nTable 336: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> continue research and development, including preclinical and clinical development of our existing product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 337: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> potentially seek regulatory approval for our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 338: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> seek to discover and develop additional product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 339: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> establish a commercialization infrastructure and scale up our manufacturing and distribution capabilities to commercialize any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 340: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> seek to comply with regulatory standards and laws;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 341: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> maintain, leverage and expand our intellectual property portfolio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 342: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> hire clinical, manufacturing, scientific and other personnel to support our product candidates development and future commercialization efforts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 343: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 344: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating as a public company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased upon our current operating plan, we expect that the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the concurrent private placement, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures requirements for at least the next 24 months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. The successful development of any product candidate is highly uncertain. Due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates, if approved, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the development of our product candidates.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\nTable 345: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the timing of, and the costs involved in, preclinical and clinical development and obtaining any regulatory approvals for our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 346: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the costs of manufacturing, distributing and processing our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 347: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the number and characteristics of any other product candidates we develop or acquire;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 348: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> our relative responsibility for developing and commercializing taNK product candidates covered by our joint development and license agreement with Sorrento Therapeutics;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 349: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other commercialization arrangements and the terms and timing of such arrangements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 350: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the degree and rate of market acceptance of any approved products;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 351: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the emergence, approval, availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of other products or treatments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 352: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 353: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the costs associated with being a public company;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 354: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing intellectual property claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 355: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, any approved products; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 356: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> any product liability or other lawsuits related to our product candidates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBecause all of our product candidates are in the early stages of preclinical and clinical development and the outcome of these efforts is uncertain, we cannot estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of any of our product candidates or whether, or when, we may achieve profitability. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and/or licensing arrangements. We do not have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical partners, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market our product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2015 for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 357: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> License agreement obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) This obligation is measured in Euros, but shown in US dollars using the exchange rate as of December 31, 2015.\nContingencies\nIn March 2009, we received a final rejection in one of our original patent applications pertaining to certain limited methods of use claims for NK-92 from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the USPTO) (but the USPTO allowed claims on all of the other proposed claims, including other methods of use). We appealed this decision with the USPTO Board of Appeals and, in the fall of 2013, the Board of Appeals reversed the Examiner's rejection of the claim to certain limited methods of use with NK-92, but affirmed the Examiner's rejection of the remaining patent claims. In December 2013, we brought an action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia to review the decision of the USPTO as we disagreed with the decision as to the certain limited non-allowed claims. On September 2, 2015, the U.S. District Court granted the USPTO's motion for summary judgment. We have filed a notice of appeal and will be appealing the decision.\nLeases\nWe lease a total of approximately 2,550 square feet of office space at 2533 South Coast Highway 101, Cardiff-by-the-Sea, California 92007, for general office use, pursuant to an operating lease. The current lease term is from September 1, 2013 to August 31, 2016. We recently amended this lease to extend the term of the lease through August 31, 2018. Our total monthly lease payment is currently $12,321 per month, through August 31, 2016. Thereafter, the total monthly lease payment will be $12,752 per month, and will increase to $13,199 on September 1, 2017.\nIn June 2015, we entered into a lease agreement for an approximate 44,681 square foot facility in San Diego, California for research and development laboratory, related office and other related uses. The term of the lease extends for seven years commencing on August 1, 2016. The base rent is $0.2 million per month with 3% annual increase each anniversary date. In July 2015, we entered into a sublease for the building with the current lessee for a term of one year commencing August 1, 2015. There is no fixed rent or operating expenses due by us during the sublease term other than utilities.\nIn July 2015, the Company entered into a lease agreement for approximately 3,067 square feet of office space in Cary, North Carolina. The term of the lease is 26 months commencing on July 1, 2015. The monthly base rent is $6,070 with 3% annual increases on each anniversary date.\nIn November 2015, we entered into a facility license agreement with NantWorks, effective in May 2015, for approximately 9,500 square feet of office space in Culver City, California, which is to be converted to a research and development laboratory and a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) laboratory. The term of the license extends through December 2020. We have the option to extend the license through December 2023. The monthly license fee is $47,000 with annual increases of 3% beginning in January 2017. Additional terms for the license shall be determined at fair market value. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded rent expense of $0.2 million, included in research and development on the consolidated statement of operations.\nWe are responsible for costs to build out the laboratory and have incurred costs of approximately $2.0 million as of December 31, 2015 which are reflected in construction in progress on the consolidated balance sheet. See Notes 8 and 9 of our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our lease obligations and related party transactions, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the periods presented, we did not have, nor do we currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined under SEC rules.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgements and Use of Estimates\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We continually evaluate our estimates and judgments, the most critical of which are those related to income taxes and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nWe generate revenue primarily from our non-exclusive license agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies granting them the right to use our cell lines and intellectual property for non-clinical use. These agreements generally include upfront fees and annual research license fees for such use, as well as commercial license fees for sales of our licensee's products developed or manufactured using our intellectual property and cell lines. Our license agreements may also include milestone payments, although to date, we have not generated any revenue from milestone payments. We recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or we have provided the service, the fees are fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.\nWhen entering into an agreement, we first determine whether the agreement includes multiple deliverables and is subject to accounting guidance in Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Subtopic 605-25, Multiple-Element Arrangements. If we determine that an agreement includes multiple elements, we determine whether the agreement should be divided into separate units of accounting and how the agreement consideration should be measured and allocated among the separate units of accounting.\nAn element qualifies as a separate unit of accounting when the delivered element has standalone value to the customer. Our agreements do not include a general right of return relative to delivered elements. Any delivered elements that do not qualify as separate units of accounting are combined with other undelivered elements within the agreement as a single unit of accounting. If the agreement constitutes a single combined unit of accounting, we determine the revenue recognition method for the combined unit of accounting and recognize the revenue over the period from inception through the date the last deliverable within the single unit of accounting is delivered.\nLicense rights and non-contingent deliverables, such as knowledge transfer, do not have standalone value as they are not sold separately and they cannot be resold and, consequently are considered a single unit of accounting. Therefore, license revenue in the form of upfront fees is deferred and recognized over the applicable relationship period, which historically has been the estimated period of the Company's substantive performance obligations or the period the rights granted are in effect.\nWe recognize a milestone payment when earned if it is substantive and we have no ongoing performance obligations related to the milestone. A milestone payment is considered substantive if it: (1) is commensurate with either the performance to achieve the milestone or the enhanced value of the delivered item as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the performance to achieve the milestone; (2) relates solely to past performance; and (3) is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms, including other potential milestone consideration, within the agreement.\nWe record any amounts received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nWe record our available-for-sale investments at fair value. At December 31, 2015, our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities totaled $191.5 million. FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820, establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value (see Note 4 Financial Statement Details\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). Each level of input represents varying degrees of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value. Valuations using Level 1 and 2 inputs are generally based on price quotations and other observable inputs in active markets and do not require significant management judgment or estimation. We utilize a third-party pricing service to assist us in obtaining fair value pricing for these investments. While pricing for these securities is based on proprietary models, the inputs used are based on observable market information; therefore we have classified our inputs as Level 1 and Level 2.\nUntil the second quarter of 2015, we had common stock warrants that met the definition of derivative financial instruments and were accounted for as a derivative liability. The fair value of this warrant derivative liability was based on a Monte Carlo simulation model at each reporting period. Estimating the fair value of the underlying shares was highly complex and subjective because our stock was not publicly traded at the time. The derivative warrant liability for the common stock warrants was $0 and $0.2 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nMarketable Securities\nWe utilize a third party investment manager to handle our excess cash with the following objectives in order of priority: preservation of capital, liquidity, prudent diversification to minimize credit and market risk exposure, optimal safekeeping, control and reporting and maximization of total return. Specific guidelines regarding permitted investments, credit quality and diversification are provided to help clarify our intent.\nWe record impairment charges through the statement of operations when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary. The determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors. Adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments, thereby requiring recognition of impairment losses. When assessing these investments for an other-than-temporary decline in value, we consider such factors as, among other things, the significance of the decline in value as compared to the cost basis; underlying factors contributing to a decline in the prices of securities in a single asset class; how long the market value of the security has been less than its cost basis; the security's relative performance versus its peers, sector or asset class; expected market volatility; the market and economy in general; analyst recommendations and price targets; views of external investment managers; news or financial information that has been released specific to the investee; and the outlook for the overall industry in which the investee operates, as applicable. If we determine that a security price decline is other than temporary, we record an impairment loss, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe have not recorded impairment losses to date on our investments in marketable securities as they were so recently acquired. However, given that investments are such a large portion of our asset base, we are doing everything possible to minimize any impact to our liquidity.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe recorded long-lived assets that include property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Furthermore, we are deemed to be the owner, for accounting purposes, during the construction phase of certain long-lived assets under build-to-suit lease arrangements because of our involvement with the construction, our exposure to any potential cost overruns and our other commitments under the arrangements. In these cases, we recognize a build-to-suit lease asset under construction and a corresponding build-to-suit lease liability on the consolidated balance sheets.\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to the future net cash flows which the assets are expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the projected undiscounted future cash flows arising from the asset using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent to the Company's current business model.\nLease Obligations\nWe categorize leases at their inception as either operating or capital leases. On certain of our lease agreements, we may receive rent holidays and other incentives. We recognize lease costs on a straight-line basis without regard to deferred payment terms, such as rent holidays that defer the commencement date of required payments. Additionally, incentives we receive for leases categorized as operating leases are treated as a reduction of our costs over the term of the agreement.\nWe established assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred under build-to-suit lease arrangements to the extent we are involved in the construction of structural improvements or take construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. Upon occupancy of facilities under build-to-suit leases, we assess whether these arrangements qualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance. If we continue to be the deemed owner, the facilities are accounted for as financing leases.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values on the grant date. We estimate the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, or Black-Scholes model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods using the straight-line method. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise our estimate in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. See Note 13 of our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our equity compensation programs and the fair value assumptions used to determine our stock-based compensation expense.\nWe account for stock-based compensation awards and warrants granted to non-employees in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees, or ASC 505-50. Under ASC 505-50, we determine the fair value of the warrants or stock-based compensation awards granted as either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. If the fair value of equity instruments issued is used, it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of either (1) the date at which commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached, or (2) the date at which the counterparty's performance is complete.\nUtilization of Net Operating Loss Carryforwards (NOLs) and Research and Development Credits\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had federal, state and foreign income tax NOLs of approximately $31.6 million, $28.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, which will expire at various dates through 2035. As of December 31, 2015 we also had minimal federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards to offset future income taxes.\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carry forwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. Although we have not completed a study to determine the impact of ownership changes on our NOLs, we believe that we have recently undergone one or more ownership changes and accordingly, our ability to use our NOLs will be limited.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nApplication of New or Revised Accounting Standards-Adopted\nIn July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exist, or ASU 2013-11. ASU 2013-11 amends the presentation requirements of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, and requires an unrecognized tax benefit to be presented in the consolidated financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a NOL carryforward, similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward. To the extent the tax benefit is not available at the reporting date under the governing tax law or if the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented as a liability and not combined with deferred tax assets. ASU 2013-11 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013. The amendments are to be applied to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist as of the effective date and may be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented. The adoption of ASU 2013-11 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn April 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, which amends ASC 205, Presentation of Financial Statements, and ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment. This ASU changes the criteria for determining which disposals can be presented as a discontinued operation and modifies existing disclosure requirements. The provisions of this update were effective as of January 1, 2015, and we have adopted this standard accordingly.\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments when the Terms of an Award Provide that a Performance Target Could Be Achieved After the Requisite Service Period, or ASU 2014-12. The ASU requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. ASU 2014-12 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted. We are early adopting ASU 2015-02 for the year ended December 31, 2015. This standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810)-Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, or ASU 2015-02. ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. Specifically, the amendments (1) modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities (VIEs) or voting interest entities, (2) eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, (3) affect the consolidated analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, and (4) provide a scope exception for certain entities. ASU 2015-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We are early adopting this for the year ended December 31, 2015. This standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, or ASU 2015-17, which eliminates the current requirement for reporting entities to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead, reporting entities will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. This guidance is effective for consolidated financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are early adopting this standard for the December 31, 2015 financial statements on a prospective basis and this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nApplication of New or Revised Accounting Standards-Not Yet Adopted\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued guidance codified in ASC Topic 606, ASU 2014-09, Revenue Recognition-Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which amends the guidance in former ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and was initially to be effective beginning January 1, 2017. This guidance requires that entities recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of ASC Topic 606 on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. On August 12, 2015, the FASB issued guidance which defers the effective date of ASC Topic 606 by one year to January 1, 2018.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, or ASU 2014-15, which amends ASC Subtopic 205-40 to provide guidance about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related disclosures. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt,\u201d (2) require an evaluation every reporting period, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management's plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management's plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that consolidated financial statements are issued. ASU 2014-15 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. We do not plan on early adopting this standard, but it will not have a material impact on our financial condition.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02), which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for operating leases with lease terms greater than twelve months in the balance sheet. The update also requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on its financial statements and disclosures.\nJOBS Act\nOn April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company,\u201d we intend to rely on certain exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act, including those relating to (i) providing an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis.

Drs. Soon-Shiong and Ji, one of our former directors, helped facilitate our reacquisition of these rights through the acquisition of Inex Bio, using their relationships with the other Inex Bio stockholders. Drs. Soon-Shiong and Ji facilitated the acquisition through the formation of Inex Bio Holdings, LLC, or Inex Bio Holdings, which purchased shares of Inex Bio from third party stockholders. Following this acquisition, Cambridge Equities, LP, an entity of which Dr. Soon-Shiong is the sole member of its general partner, and Eragon Ventures, LLC, an entity of which Dr. Ji was the managing member, each owned fifty percent (50%) of InexBio Holdings.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our net cash used in operating activities of $25.3 million consisted of a net loss of $236.9 million, primarily attributable to $211.2 million in stock compensation expense, $5.4 million cash compensation expense to our Chief Executive Officer and a former director in association with the acquisition of Inex Bio, as well as increases in legal expenses primarily to protect and maintain our patents and spending on research and development efforts. This was partially adjusted by $211.3 million for non-cash items and $0.3 million of cash provided in changes in working capital. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of the $211.2 million in stock-based compensation, $1.5 million in depreciation and amortization, and $1.4 million change in fair value of our derivative warrant liability, partially offset by $2.5 million gain on sales of marketable securities and $0.3 million in a deferred tax benefit. Changes in working capital consisted primarily of increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $2.6 million, due to related parties of $1.4 million and $0.9 million of deferred rent partially offset by an increase of $4.5 million of other current and non-current assets and $0.1 million decrease in deferred revenue.\nTable 334: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December

The term of the license extends through December 2020. We have the option to extend the license through December 2023. The monthly license fee is $47,000 with annual increases of three percent (3%) beginning in January 2017. Additional terms for the license shall be determined at fair market value. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded rent expense of $0.2 million, included in research and development on the consolidated statement of operations.\nSorrento Therapeutics. In December 2014, we entered into a global/exclusive collaboration with Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc., or Sorrento, to jointly develop taNK product candidates as may be agreed between the parties. This transaction allows us to leverage Sorrento's proprietary G-MAB technology platform, one of the largest fully human antibody libraries in the world, to source CARs for our taNK product candidates. The economics from each product candidate will be dependent on the proportion of the development costs that each party contributes. As of the date hereof, the parties have not yet agreed upon any projects under the Joint Development and License Agreement; therefore Sorrento has no rights to use our NK cells or other technologies or intellectual property rights or to begin related research, development or commercialization activities and we are free to pursue, and are actively pursuing, research, development and commercialization activities with antibodies that may bind to various targets, including PDL1, ROR-1, CD33 and CD123.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense, Net\n \u00b7 incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating as a public company. \nOur Integrated Discovery Ecosystem for Precision Medicine. In order to effectively target newly discovered neoepitopes, we plan to integrate the following ecosystem to help drive the development of genetically modified NK cells anticipated to be directed against these cancer-promoting mutated proteins: (1) a high-speed supercomputing infrastructure to help identify both known antigens on the surface of tumor cells and neoepitopes in clinical patients suffering from cancer, in a timely manner and at large scale; (2) a next-generation genomic and transcriptomic sequencing infrastructure to identify the expression of the neoepitopes on the surface of the tumor cell, GPS Cancer developed by our affiliate entity NantOmics; (3) delivering the neoepitope via an adenoviral vector developed by an affiliate entity to induce IgG1 in-vivo production and ADCC activity by our High Affinity NK Cell (haNK) (4) a diverse library of human antibodies from which to interrogate and extract an antibody matching the neoepitope; and (5) an aNK and haNK cell potentially capable of being produced as a scalable cell-based off-the-shelf\u201d therapy without the need for patient compatibility matching. We expect to regularly add newly discovered neoepitopes from our discovery engine, and we believe the thousands of newly discovered antigens selectively expressed on the cancer cells and not on the essential normal tissue will provide us with the ability to create new and targeted libraries of antibodies to be potentially delivered as living drugs for metastatic cancer cells and cancer stem cells.\nInex Bio Acquisition\nBecause all of our product candidates are in the early stages of preclinical and clinical development and the outcome of these efforts is uncertain, we cannot estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of any of our product candidates or whether, or when, we may achieve profitability. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and/or licensing arrangements. We do not have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical partners, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market our product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was $64.4 million and consisted of $63.1 million of net proceeds from our debt and equity offerings, $1.2 million in payments received for prior issuance of Class B common stock and $0.2 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $0.1 million related to payments on the notes payable.\nItem 7.

ASU 2013-11 amends the presentation requirements of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, and requires an unrecognized tax benefit to be presented in the consolidated financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a NOL carryforward, similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward. To the extent the tax benefit is not available at the reporting date under the governing tax law or if the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented as a liability and not combined with deferred tax assets. ASU 2013-11 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013. The amendments are to be applied to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist as of the effective date and may be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented. The adoption of ASU 2013-11 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, or ASU 2014-15, which amends ASC Subtopic 205-40 to provide guidance about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related disclosures. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt,\u201d (2) require an evaluation every reporting period, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management's plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management's plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that consolidated financial statements are issued. ASU 2014-15 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. We do not plan on early adopting this standard, but it will not have a material impact on our financial condition.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) consists primarily of income from our investments in marketable securities, non-cash costs related to fair value adjustments to our derivative warrant liability, debt discount to interest expense, equity in loss of Inex Bio, and foreign currency transaction expense. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded investment income from cash received for interest, dividends and realized gains on the sale of equity securities of $ 3.0 million, which was partially offset by $38,000 of non-cash costs related to the amortization of our investment net premium position. We were also relieved of our note payable outstanding as of December 31, 2014. The relief of debt is recorded in other income (expense).\nWe are a pioneering clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on harnessing the power of the innate immune system by using the natural killer cell to treat cancer, infectious diseases and inflammatory diseases. Natural killer, or NK, cells are the body's first line of defense due to their innate ability to rapidly seek and destroy abnormal cells, such as cancer or virally-infected cells, without prior exposure or activation by other support molecules required to activate adaptive immune cells such as T-cells.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810)-Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, or ASU 2015-02. ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. Specifically, the amendments (1) modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities (VIEs) or voting interest entities, (2) eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, (3) affect the consolidated analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, and (4) provide a scope exception for certain entities. ASU 2015-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We are early adopting this for the year ended December 31, 2015. This standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2015, we entered into a lease agreement for an approximate 44,681 square foot facility in San Diego, California for research and development laboratory, related office and other related uses. The term of the lease extends for seven years commencing on August 1, 2016. The base rent is $0.2 million per month with 3% annual increase each anniversary date. In July 2015, we entered into a sublease for the building with the current lessee for a term of one year commencing August 1, 2015. There is no fixed rent or operating expenses due by us during the sublease term other than utilities.\n \u00b7 the number and characteristics of any other product candidates we develop or acquire; \nThe following table sets forth our primary sources and uses of cash the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nRevenue decreased $0.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was attributable to earning $0.2 million in commercial license fees associated with one of our licensees' first commercial sale of a product developed using our intellectual property and cell lines in 2014 that did not re-occur in 2015. Additionally, $0.2 million of the decrease was attributable to the transfer to Brink Biologics at the beginning of June 2015 of all of our then-existing, revenue-earning, non-exclusive license agreements that allow third parties to use our cell line and intellectual property for non-clinical laboratory testing as discussed above under the heading Spin-Out of Testing and Diagnostic Products and Services.\u201d As a result of this spin-out, we will no longer receive revenue from these agreements.\nWe account for stock-based compensation under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values on the grant date. We estimate the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, or Black-Scholes model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods using the straight-line method. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise our estimate in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. See Note 13 of our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our equity compensation programs and the fair value assumptions used to determine our stock-based compensation expense.\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased $223.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to $209.3 million in stock compensation expense, of which $141.9 million is related to service and performance based criteria applicable to a warrant granted to Dr. Soon-Shiong, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Warrant Agreement, or the Warrant Agreement. The stock compensation expense related to the Warrant Agreement includes $114.5 million for the achievement of a financing transaction with a strategic partner, which triggered the vesting of 8,331,750 warrant shares in the second quarter of 2015, $22.9 million related to service-based vesting and $4.5 million related to another performance milestone where achievement is deemed probable. In addition to the impact of the Warrant Agreement, the increase in stock compensation included $38.2 million related to stock options and restricted stock units, or RSUs, also granted to our Dr. Soon-Shiong and to Dr. Simon, our President and Chief Operating Officer, $22.7 million related to grants to Dr. Soon-Shiong and a former director for their assistance in connection with the asset purchase of Inex Bio and $6.5 million related to stock options and RSUs issued to employees and non-employees. We expect our stock based compensation expense included in selling, general, and administrative expense to decrease significantly for the foreseeable future.\n \u00b7 employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation; and \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\n \u00b7 maintain, leverage and expand our intellectual property portfolio; \nThe costs of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project owing to, but not limited to, the following:\nSelling, General and Administrative\n \u00b7 the costs associated with being a public company; \nFinancing Activities\n \u00b7 the costs of manufacturing, distributing and processing our product candidates; \n\nLease Obligations\nResearch and development expense increased $9.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to $2.5 million in laboratory and clinical trial expenses, $1.7 million in compensation expense related to increased staff, consultant costs, and shared services, $1.6 million for new lab and manufacturing facility expenses, $1.5 million payment for initial license fees under a license agreement, $1.3 million in amortization of intangible assets from the Inex Bio acquisition, and $1.1 million for stock compensation expense related to consultants and an increase in staffing. We expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as we advance an increased number of our product candidates through clinical development and conduct our planned clinical trials.\nResults of Operations\n \u00b7 the number of doses that patients receive; \nIn May 2014, the FASB issued guidance codified in ASC Topic 606, ASU 2014-09, Revenue Recognition-Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which amends the guidance in former ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and was initially to be effective beginning January 1, 2017. This guidance requires that entities recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of ASC Topic 606 on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. On August 12, 2015, the FASB issued guidance which defers the effective date of ASC Topic 606 by one year to January 1, 2018.\nOperating Expenses\n \u00b7 the cost of comparative agents used in clinical trials; \nOn June 9, 2015, we spun out our business relating to testing and diagnostic products and services to Brink Biologics in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Brink Biologics. We subsequently distributed the shares of Brink Biologics by a dividend to our stockholders of record on June 9, 2015, on a pro rata basis. Under the spin-out arrangement, we transferred to Brink Biologics all of our existing, revenue-earning, non-exclusive license agreements that allow third parties to use our cell lines and intellectual property for non-clinical laboratory testing, and also transferred or licensed to Brink Biologics our other assets pertaining to testing and diagnostics products and services. Our board of directors determined that our strategic focus is to utilize our resources to pursue the potential treatment of cancer, infectious diseases and inflammatory diseases, rather than to utilize our resources and intellectual property to focus on non-clinical laboratory testing for minimal revenue opportunities as compared to the potential market opportunity that may exist for our therapeutic focus. We granted to Brink Biologics worldwide, exclusive licenses, for use only in the field of in vitro and in vivo testing and diagnostic products and services and under certain cell lines, trademarks, know-how and patents, including the intellectual property rights licensed to us under our license agreement with Fox Chase Cancer Center. Brink Biologics is restricted in its ability to modify the licensed cell lines, and we will have at least joint ownership of any such modifications and the ability to use those modifications outside Brink Biologics' field. We also have a non-exclusive license to any results and data arising from Brink Biologics' use of our cell lines and intellectual property for our use for internal research purposes and outside of Brink Biologics' field. In consideration for the license grants, Brink Biologics is obligated to pay us a low single-digit royalty on amounts received for the sale of licensed products and services, as well as a low single-digit percentage share of other revenue received by Brink Biologics from the grant of sublicenses under our rights. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded $11,000 in revenue for royalties. Brink Biologics has the right to terminate the license agreement for convenience. We have the right to terminate the license agreement if Brink Biologics challenges any of our patents or the patents licensed to us by Fox Chase Cancer Center. We and Brink Biologics each have the right to terminate the license agreement if the other party is dissolved or is declared bankrupt, or remains in breach of any material obligation following a sixty day cure period to remedy the breach. Also, as part of the spin-out arrangement, we have agreed to provide certain services to Brink Biologics for a transitional period on a fee-for-service basis. As of December 31, 2015, we invoiced Brink Biologics for service fees in the amount of $22,000 which is recorded in other income on our consolidated statements of operations. Had we consummated the spin-out as of the beginning of the year, for the year ended December 31, 2015, our revenue would have been $26,000 and selling, general and administrative expense would still have been $227.7 million. There is no impact to our consolidated balance sheet because the spin-out occurred at the beginning of June. Accordingly, it is already reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. We further determined that we have a variable interest in Brink Biologics through our royalty agreement with them. However, we are not the primary beneficiary, and as such, do not consolidate the entity.\nIn May 2012, we acquired 57,000 shares of Inex Bio for $0.2 million, which represented 22.2% of the outstanding shares and 17.4% of the fully-diluted shares of Inex Bio. At that time, Inex Bio had only one other stockholder and one option holder.\n\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2015 for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\nIn April 2012, we made a strategic decision to enter into a License Agreement, or the Inex License Agreement, with Inex Bio, Inc. or Inex Bio, a Republic of Korea corporation. Under the Inex License Agreement, we provided Inex Bio with an exclusive license to our technology to be used in products only in certain Asian countries. In exchange for the exclusive license, we received a $0.3 million up-front license fee. In addition, we are entitled to receive milestone payments of up to $0.8 million based upon the completion of certain clinical trials and a 5% royalty on the net sales of applicable products using our aNK cells. No milestone payments or royalties have ever been due or received under this agreement.\nIn November 2015, we entered into a shared services agreement with NantWorks under which NantWorks will provide corporate, general and administrative, manufacturing strategy, regulatory and clinical trial strategy and other support services to us. We will be charged for the services at cost plus reasonable allocations for indirect costs that relate to the employees providing the services. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded operating expenses of $0.3 million to research and development and $1.0 million to selling, general and administrative on the consolidated statement of operations under this arrangement.\n \u00b7 establish a commercialization infrastructure and scale up our manufacturing and distribution capabilities to commercialize any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval; \n \u00b7 facility expenses dedicated to research and development. \nBased upon our current operating plan, we expect that the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the concurrent private placement, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures requirements for at least the next 24 months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. The successful development of any product candidate is highly uncertain. Due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates, if approved, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the development of our product candidates.\nWe record any amounts received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nWe do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, which we do not expect to happen for at least the next several years, if ever. Until such time that we can generate substantial revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operating activities through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition and could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our research and development programs or commercialization efforts. Failure to receive additional funding could cause us to cease operations, in part or in full.\nOn March 30, 2015, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with InexBio Holdings and certain other parties, or the purchase agreement, pursuant to which we acquired all the remaining outstanding shares of Inex Bio not previously owned by us for cash consideration of $8.0 million and the issuance of a warrant to purchase 3,202,593 shares of our Class A common stock at an exercise price of $2.00 per share. We paid (1) $1.5 million in cash and warrants to purchase 593,072 shares of our Class A common stock valued at approximately $5.2 million to the third party stockholders; and (2) $6.5 million of cash and warrants to purchase 2,609,520 shares of our Class A common stock valued at $22.7 million to Inex Bio Holdings. The purpose of providing the warrants was primarily to avoid having to use additional cash consideration for the acquisition. In addition, the subsequent exercise of the warrants by InexBio Holdings and other former shareholders of Inex Bio provided us with additional cash to fund our own operations. At the time of our acquisition of the remaining shares of Inex Bio, Dr. Simon, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and one of our former directors, was on the board of directors of Inex Bio. Subsequent to the closing of the transaction, InexBio Holdings exercised the warrant we issued in connection with the transaction for 2,609,520 shares of our common stock for aggregate cash consideration to us of $5.2 million.\nResearch and development expense consists of expenses incurred while performing research and development activities to discover and develop our product candidates. This includes conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, manufacturing development efforts and activities related to regulatory filings for product candidates. We recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred. Our research and development expense primarily consists of:\nLeases\nOther Income (Expense)\n(1) Amounts reflected in the table for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, have been retrospectively adjusted to apply a change in the method of accounting for patent costs we adopted on December 31, 2015. See Note 15 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nWe recognize a milestone payment when earned if it is substantive and we have no ongoing performance obligations related to the milestone. A milestone payment is considered substantive if it: (1) is commensurate with either the performance to achieve the milestone or the enhanced value of the delivered item as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the performance to achieve the milestone; (2) relates solely to past performance; and (3) is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms, including other potential milestone consideration, within the agreement.\nFrom June 10, 2015 through July 8, 2015, we raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately $78.0 million from the sale of common stock in a series of private placement transactions to third parties. On June 18, 2015, we repurchased 249,952 shares of common stock from an employee at $19.20 per share for approximately $4.8 million.\nWe recorded long-lived assets that include property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Furthermore, we are deemed to be the owner, for accounting purposes, during the construction phase of certain long-lived assets under build-to-suit lease arrangements because of our involvement with the construction, our exposure to any potential cost overruns and our other commitments under the arrangements. In these cases, we recognize a build-to-suit lease asset under construction and a corresponding build-to-suit lease liability on the consolidated balance sheets.\nIn July 2015, the Company entered into a lease agreement for approximately 3,067 square feet of office space in Cary, North Carolina. The term of the lease is 26 months commencing on July 1, 2015. The monthly base rent is $6,070 with 3% annual increases on each anniversary date.\nSelling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel-related costs, including employee benefits and any stock-based compensation, for employees performing functions other than research and development. This includes personnel in executive, finance, human resources and administrative support functions. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs not otherwise allocated to research and development expense, professional fees for auditing, tax and legal services, advertising costs, expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining patents, consulting costs, royalties and licensing costs, and costs of our information systems.\nOur targeted therapeutic areas include: (1) cancer, focusing on bulky hematological cancers and solid tumors as well as cancer stem cells, (2) infectious diseases, including viral, fungal and bacterial infections, and (3) inflammatory diseases, ranging from rare inherited diseases to more prevalent autoimmune disorders.\nAs of December 31, 2015 we had 31 employees and currently, we have 41 employees. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $317.3 million, which consisted mainly of $316.5 million in net proceeds from our equity offerings, consisting of $221.5 million from our IPO, $78.0 million from a pre-IPO stock issuance, and $17.0 million from a private stock placement concurrent with the IPO. Additionally, $7.3 million in cash was provided from the exercise of warrants ($5.2 million of which were issued in conjunction with the acquisition of Inex Bio), and $0.9 million from the exercise of stock options. This was partially offset by a $4.8 million payment to repurchase shares of our common stock from an employee and $2.4 million of payroll taxes related to net share settlement of RSUs.\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carry forwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. Although we have not completed a study to determine the impact of ownership changes on our NOLs, we believe that we have recently undergone one or more ownership changes and accordingly, our ability to use our NOLs will be limited.\nComponents of our Results of Operations\nMultiple Modes of Tumor Cell Killing. Our immuno-oncology NK platform has multiple modes to potentially induce cell death against the tumor or infected cell by: (1) direct killing by binding to stress ligands expressed by the diseased cell with the release of toxic granules directly into the tumor cell; (2) antibody mediated killing by binding to antibodies administered in combination and enhancing the cancer killing effect of the administered antibody, enabling targeted cell killing through antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity, or ADCC; and (3) target activated killing by binding to known or newly discovered tumor-specific antigens expressed on the surface of tumor cells and inducing cell death by the release of toxic granules directly into the tumor cell and by the release of cytokines and chemokines which recruit additional innate and adaptive immune responses, including the recruitment of cytotoxic T-cells.\nOperating Activities\nOverview\nIn June 2015, we spun out Brink Biologics, Inc., or Brink Biologics, and Coneksis, Inc., or Coneksis. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has a controlling interest in Brink Biologics and Coneksis. For a description of each of these transactions see the disclosure under Spin-Out of Testing and Diagnostic Products and Services\u201d and Spin-Out of Veterinary Oncology Rights\u201d below.\nSubstantially all of our research and development expenses to date have been incurred in connection with our product candidates. We expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as we advance an increased number of our product candidates through clinical development, including the conduct of our planned clinical trials. The process of conducting clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming. The successful development of product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing or costs required to complete the remaining development of any product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of product candidates.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, our net cash used in operating activities of $0.7 million consisted of a net loss of $2.0 million, primarily attributable to our spending on research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses, partially adjusted by $0.5 million for non-cash items and $0.9 million of cash provided by changes in working capital. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $0.9 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.3 million of amortization of the debt discount, partially offset by the change in fair value of our derivative warrant liability of $0.7 million. Changes in working capital consisted primarily of an increase in accounts payable of $0.7 million.\nJOBS Act\nMarketable Securities\nWe are responsible for costs to build out the laboratory and have incurred costs of approximately $2.0 million as of December 31, 2015 which are reflected in construction in progress on the consolidated balance sheet. See Notes 8 and 9 of our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our lease obligations and related party transactions, respectively.\n \u00b7 continue research and development, including preclinical and clinical development of our existing product candidates; \nSpin-Out of Veterinary Oncology Rights\n \u00b7 the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate. \nIncome Tax\n \u00b7 incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating as a public company. \n \u00b7 the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing intellectual property claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation; \nWe established assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred under build-to-suit lease arrangements to the extent we are involved in the construction of structural improvements or take construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. Upon occupancy of facilities under build-to-suit leases, we assess whether these arrangements qualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance. If we continue to be the deemed owner, the facilities are accounted for as financing leases.\nAgreements with Affiliates of NantWorks\nUntil the second quarter of 2015, we had common stock warrants that met the definition of derivative financial instruments and were accounted for as a derivative liability. The fair value of this warrant derivative liability was based on a Monte Carlo simulation model at each reporting period. Estimating the fair value of the underlying shares was highly complex and subjective because our stock was not publicly traded at the time. The derivative warrant liability for the common stock warrants was $0 and $0.2 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nStock-based Compensation\nFuture Funding Requirements\nIn addition, there were increases of $8.1 million in salaries, personnel-related and shared service costs, of which $5.4 million is cash consideration paid to our CEO and a former director in association with the acquisition of Inex Bio, $1.6 million is related to an increase in staffing, and $1.0 million is related to shared service costs. There were also increases in expenses of $2.1 million for legal costs primarily to protect and maintain our patents and a $1.4 million increase related to becoming and operating as a public company including director and office insurance premiums, legal fees and registration fees. There was also an increase of $1.2 million for accounting and public relations services as well as $1.0 million in increased travel expenses. These increases were partially offset by a $0.2 million decrease in royalties and cost of licensing, which was primarily attributable to the transfer of the majority of our existing revenue-earning, non-exclusive license agreements that allow third parties to use our cell line and intellectual property for non-clinical laboratory testing to Brink Biologics at the beginning of June 2015.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, or ASU 2015-17, which eliminates the current requirement for reporting entities to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead, reporting entities will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. This guidance is effective for consolidated financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are early adopting this standard for the December 31, 2015 financial statements on a prospective basis and this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe that our proprietary NK cell line, coupled with our planned integrated discovery ecosystem, positions us to implement precision cancer medicine by leveraging the advances that have evolved during the past decade and addressing newly discovered challenges of cancer. Cancer is only recently understood to be a complex of rare diseases, with hundreds of patient-specific, cancer-promoting mutated proteins, some known and many more unknown called neoepitopes. Identifying and targeting these mutated proteins is our strategy to overcome the challenges of cancer in the era of genomics, transcriptomics and immuno-oncology. We believe neoepitopes, which are newly discovered antigens selectively expressed on the cancer cells and not on the essential normal tissue, represent large untapped targeting opportunities for immune effector cells such as our activated NK cells.\n \u00b7 continue research and development, including preclinical and clinical development of our existing product candidates; \nOn July 31, 2015, we closed the initial public offering, or IPO, of 9,531,200 shares of common stock in which we raised proceeds of $221.5 million after underwriters' discounts and commissions and offering expenses. Concurrently with our initial public offering, we completed a separate private offering of 680,000 shares of common stock in which we raised net proceeds of $17.0 million.\nWe classify our operating expenses into research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs including salaries, benefits, bonuses and specifically stock-based compensation expense comprise a significant component of our research and development and selling, general and administrative expense categories. We allocate expenses associated with our facilities and information technology costs between these two categories based on the nature of each cost.\n \u00b7 seek to discover and develop additional product candidates; \n \u00b7 hire clinical, manufacturing, scientific and other personnel to support our product candidates development and future commercialization efforts; \nIn November 2015, we entered into a facility license agreement with NantWorks, effective in May 2015, for approximately 9,500 square feet of office space in Culver City, California, which is to be converted to a research and development laboratory and a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) laboratory. The term of the license extends through December 2020. We have the option to extend the license through December 2023. The monthly license fee is $47,000 with annual increases of 3% beginning in January 2017. Additional terms for the license shall be determined at fair market value. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded rent expense of $0.2 million, included in research and development on the consolidated statement of operations.\nWe utilize a third party investment manager to handle our excess cash with the following objectives in order of priority: preservation of capital, liquidity, prudent diversification to minimize credit and market risk exposure, optimal safekeeping, control and reporting and maximization of total return. Specific guidelines regarding permitted investments, credit quality and diversification are provided to help clarify our intent.\nOn April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company,\u201d we intend to rely on certain exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act, including those relating to (i) providing an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an emerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (i) the last day of our first fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more, (ii) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer\u201d under the rules of the SEC with at least $700 million of outstanding equity securities held by non-affiliates, (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the previous three years, or (iv) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial public offering.\nIn February and March 2015, InexBio Holdings paid $1.1 million in cash to the third party stockholders to acquire a 67.3% interest in Inex Bio. Following this transaction, we owned a 22.2% interest in Inex Bio, InexBio Holdings owned a 67.3% interest in Inex Bio and the third party stockholders held the remainder of the Inex Bio shares. We believed that it was in our best interest for InexBio Holdings to acquire the shares directly from the third party stockholders of Inex Bio because of Dr. Soon-Shiong's and Dr. Ji's relationships with the stockholders and our belief that this would be the quickest manner to effect the acquisition and at the lowest price.\nAn element qualifies as a separate unit of accounting when the delivered element has standalone value to the customer. Our agreements do not include a general right of return relative to delivered elements. Any delivered elements that do not qualify as separate units of accounting are combined with other undelivered elements within the agreement as a single unit of accounting. If the agreement constitutes a single combined unit of accounting, we determine the revenue recognition method for the combined unit of accounting and recognize the revenue over the period from inception through the date the last deliverable within the single unit of accounting is delivered.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgements and Use of Estimates\nRevenue\nWe account for stock-based compensation awards and warrants granted to non-employees in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees, or ASC 505-50. Under ASC 505-50, we determine the fair value of the warrants or stock-based compensation awards granted as either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. If the fair value of equity instruments issued is used, it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of either (1) the date at which commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached, or (2) the date at which the counterparty's performance is complete.\nSpin-Out of Testing and Diagnostic Products and Services\n \u00b7 maintain, leverage and expand our intellectual property portfolio; \nIncome tax (benefit) expense increased by ($0.3) million during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was attributable to income tax benefits related to losses at InexBio.\nSelling, General and Administrative\n \u00b7 the duration of patient follow-up; and \nResearch and Development\nOn June 9, 2015, we spun out our business relating to veterinary oncology to Coneksis in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Coneksis. We subsequently distributed the shares of Coneksis by a dividend to our stockholders of record on June 9, 2015, on a pro rata basis. In connection with the spin-out arrangement, we granted to Coneksis worldwide, exclusive licenses, for use only in the field of veterinary medical research and therapeutics, under certain cell lines, trademarks, know-how and patents, including the intellectual property rights licensed to us under our license agreement with Fox Chase Cancer Center. Like Brink Biologics, Coneksis is restricted in its ability to modify the licensed cell lines, and we will have at least joint ownership of any such modifications and the ability to use those modifications outside Coneksis' field. We also have a non-exclusive license to any results and data arising from Coneksis' use of our cell lines and intellectual property for our use for internal research purposes and outside of Coneksis' field. In consideration for the license grants, Coneksis is obligated to pay us a low single-digit royalty on amounts received for the sale of licensed products and services, as well as a low single-digit percentage share of other revenue received by Coneksis from the grant of sublicenses under our rights. Coneksis has the right to terminate the license agreement for convenience. We have the right to terminate the license agreement if Coneksis challenges any of our patents or the patents licensed to us by Fox Chase Cancer Center. We and Coneksis each have the right to terminate the license agreement if the other party is dissolved or is declared bankrupt, or remains in breach of any material obligation following a sixty day cure period to remedy the breach. Finally, as part of the spin-out arrangement, we have agreed to provide certain services to Coneksis for a transitional period on a fee-for-service basis. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we invoiced Coneksis for service fees in the amount of $6,000 which is recorded in other income on our consolidated statements of operations. Had we consummated the spin-out as of the beginning of the year, there would have been no material impact to our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015, or our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. We further determined that we have a variable interest in Coneksis through our royalty agreement with them. However, we are not the primary beneficiary, and as such, do not consolidate the entity.\nTo date, we have derived substantially all of our revenue from non-exclusive license agreements with numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies granting them the right to use our cell lines and intellectual property for non-clinical use. These agreements generally include upfront fees and annual research license fees for such use, as well as commercial license fees for sales of our licensee's products developed or manufactured using our intellectual property and cell lines. Our license agreements may also include milestone payments, although to date, we have not generated any revenue from milestone payments. We recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or we have provided the service, the fees are fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We expect our revenue from non-clinical license agreements to decrease to a nominal amount in the future as we have transferred virtually all of our revenue-generating license agreements to Brink Biologics in the spin-out transaction described above. In the future, we may generate revenue from license agreements entered into for therapeutic uses. To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales. If we fail to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner or fail to obtain regulatory approval for them, we may never be able to generate substantial future revenue.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had federal, state and foreign income tax NOLs of approximately $31.6 million, $28.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, which will expire at various dates through 2035. As of December 31, 2015 we also had minimal federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards to offset future income taxes.\n \u00b7 per patient trial costs; \n \u00b7 the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, any approved products; and \nDuring the second quarter of 2015, due to the price at which our common stock sold in a series of private placement transactions, we retroactively reassessed the estimated fair value per share of our common stock for financial reporting purposes. As a result of its reassessment, we determined that, solely for financial reporting purposes, the fair value of its common stock was higher than the fair market values determined in good faith by our board of directors for each of the option grant dates from and after January 2015. The exercise price of $2.00 per share for the warrants issued to InexBio Holdings in March 2015 was based upon the fair market value determined in good faith by our board of directors. As a result of the retroactive reassessment in the second quarter of 2015, the issuance of the warrants resulted in compensation expense to Dr. Soon-Shiong and to Dr. Ji of $22.7 million.\nApplication of New or Revised Accounting Standards-Not Yet Adopted\n \u00b7 our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other commercialization arrangements and the terms and timing of such arrangements; \nCash Flows\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, net cash used in investing activities was $0.2 million and $3,000, respectively, which was attributable to the purchase of property and equipment.\nIn March 2009, we received a final rejection in one of our original patent applications pertaining to certain limited methods of use claims for NK-92 from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the USPTO) (but the USPTO allowed claims on all of the other proposed claims, including other methods of use). We appealed this decision with the USPTO Board of Appeals and, in the fall of 2013, the Board of Appeals reversed the Examiner's rejection of the claim to certain limited methods of use with NK-92, but affirmed the Examiner's rejection of the remaining patent claims. In December 2013, we brought an action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia to review the decision of the USPTO as we disagreed with the decision as to the certain limited non-allowed claims. On September 2, 2015, the U.S. District Court granted the USPTO's motion for summary judgment. We have filed a notice of appeal and will be appealing the decision.\nLong-Lived Assets\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013\nWe anticipate that strategic collaborations will become an integral part of our operations, providing opportunities to leverage our partners' expertise and capabilities to further expand the potential of our technologies and product candidates. We believe we are well positioned to become a leader in cell-based immunotherapy due to our broad and vertically integrated platform and through complementary strategic partnerships.\nApplication of New or Revised Accounting Standards-Adopted\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n \u00b7 seek to comply with regulatory standards and laws; \nIn April 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, which amends ASC 205, Presentation of Financial Statements, and ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment. This ASU changes the criteria for determining which disposals can be presented as a discontinued operation and modifies existing disclosure requirements. The provisions of this update were effective as of January 1, 2015, and we have adopted this standard accordingly.\nRecent Equity Transactions\n \u00b7 manufacturing and testing costs and related supplies and materials; \nWe generate revenue primarily from our non-exclusive license agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies granting them the right to use our cell lines and intellectual property for non-clinical use. These agreements generally include upfront fees and annual research license fees for such use, as well as commercial license fees for sales of our licensee's products developed or manufactured using our intellectual property and cell lines. Our license agreements may also include milestone payments, although to date, we have not generated any revenue from milestone payments. We recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or we have provided the service, the fees are fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.\nIn November 2015, the board of directors approved a share repurchase program allowing our Chief Executive Officer or our Chief Financial Officer, on behalf of the Company, to repurchase from time to time, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, up to $50 million of our outstanding shares of common stock, exclusive of any commissions, markups or expenses. The timing and amounts of any purchases will be based on market conditions and other factors, including price, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations. The program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares and may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time without prior notice. We expect to finance the purchases with existing cash balances. No shares were repurchased as of December 31, 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, our net cash used in operating activities of $5.4 million consisted of a net loss of $6.2 million, primarily attributable to an increase in spending on research and development efforts and selling, general and administrative expenses, and $0.8 million of cash used to fund changes in working capital, partially adjusted by $1.6 million for non-cash items. Changes in working capital consisted primarily of a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $0.7 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $0.8 million of stock-based compensation expense, $0.4 million of amortization of the debt discount, and a change in fair value of our derivative warrant liability of $0.2 million.\n \u00b7 expenses incurred under agreements with investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials; \nContingencies\nResearch and development expense increased by $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily attributable to a $0.6 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs due to an increase in headcount of our research and development personnel, a $0.4 million increase in laboratory and clinical trials expenses and a $0.1 million increase in rent expense for our research and development facilities.\nWe lease a total of approximately 2,550 square feet of office space at 2533 South Coast Highway 101, Cardiff-by-the-Sea, California 92007, for general office use, pursuant to an operating lease. The current lease term is from September 1, 2013 to August 31, 2016. We recently amended this lease to extend the term of the lease through August 31, 2018. Our total monthly lease payment is currently $12,321 per month, through August 31, 2016. Thereafter, the total monthly lease payment will be $12,752 per month, and will increase to $13,199 on September 1, 2017.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nOther income increased $2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to a $3.0 million increase in investment income related to a realized gain of $2.5 million from the sale of equity securities and a $0.5 million increase in dividend and interest income. There was also a reduction of $0.5 million in interest expense as the Company paid off all its debt in 2014. This decrease in expense was partially offset by an increase in the fair value adjustment of $1.2 million related to our derivative warrant liability.\nTo date, we have generated minimal revenue from non-exclusive license agreements with numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies granting the right to use our cell lines and intellectual property for non-clinical use for laboratory testing that were spun out to Brink Biologics on June 9, 2015. We have not generated any revenue from product sales. We do not expect to generate significant revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize any of our product candidates and we do not know when, or if, this will occur. In addition, we expect our expenses to significantly increase in connection with our ongoing development activities, particularly as we continue the research, development and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates. Moreover, since the completion of our IPO in July 2015, we have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur in the future additional costs associated with operating as a public company. In addition, subject to obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses for product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. We anticipate that we will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. We expect that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:\nWe typically use our employee, consultant and infrastructure resources across our development programs. We track outsourced development costs by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs, other internal costs or external consultant costs to specific product candidates or development programs.\nWe record impairment charges through the statement of operations when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary. The determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors. Adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments, thereby requiring recognition of impairment losses. When assessing these investments for an other-than-temporary decline in value, we consider such factors as, among other things, the significance of the decline in value as compared to the cost basis; underlying factors contributing to a decline in the prices of securities in a single asset class; how long the market value of the security has been less than its cost basis; the security's relative performance versus its peers, sector or asset class; expected market volatility; the market and economy in general; analyst recommendations and price targets; views of external investment managers; news or financial information that has been released specific to the investee; and the outlook for the overall industry in which the investee operates, as applicable. If we determine that a security price decline is other than temporary, we record an impairment loss, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased by $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $1.9 million in salaries and personnel-related costs as we prepared to file our registration statement and operate as a public company. Patent filing expenses increased by $0.2 million as we continued to apply for patent protection for our product candidates. Additionally, royalties and cost of licensing increased $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in royalty payments under our in-licensing agreements during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIn 2010, we issued, in conjunction with a termination and release agreement, a warrant to purchase 114,822 shares of Class A common stock. We accounted for the warrant as a derivative liability, which was adjusted to fair value each reporting period. The warrant was exercised in April 2015 and the derivative liability was reclassified to additional paid-in capital.\n \u00b7 any product liability or other lawsuits related to our product candidates. \nWe have not recorded impairment losses to date on our investments in marketable securities as they were so recently acquired. However, given that investments are such a large portion of our asset base, we are doing everything possible to minimize any impact to our liquidity.\nResearch and Development\nIn June 2015, we also entered into a supply agreement with NantCell, Inc., or NantCell pursuant to which we have the right to purchase NantCell's proprietary bioreactors, made according to specifications we mutually agree with NantCell, in such quantities as we may require from time to time during the term of the agreement. We also have the right to purchase reagents and consumables associated with such equipment from NantCell. We made a non-refundable upfront payment to NantCell of $0.5 million, which is creditable against our future equipment purchases under the agreement. We are also obligated to pay for any equipment and consumables we purchase from NantCell on a cost-plus basis. The agreement has an initial term of five years and renews automatically for successive one year periods unless terminated by us or NantCell. We and NantCell have the right to terminate the agreement for convenience on 90 days prior written notice, or in the event there is a material, uncured breach of the agreement by the other party.\n(1) Amounts reflected in the table for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, have been retrospectively adjusted to apply a change in the method of accounting for patent costs we adopted on December 31, 2015. See Note 15 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nIn June 2015, we entered into an agreement with NantOmics, LLC, or NantOmics, to obtain genomic sequencing and proteomic analysis services, as well as related data management and bioinformatics services, exclusively from NantOmics. We will have rights to use the data and results generated from NantOmics' services in connection with the performance of the particular oncology trial with respect to which the services were performed, but NantOmics will own the data and results, as well as any other intellectual property it creates in performing these services for us. We are obligated to pay NantOmics a fixed, per sample fee, determined based on the type of services being provided. The agreement has an initial term of five years and renews automatically for successive one year periods, unless terminated by us or NantOmics. We and NantOmics have the right to terminate the agreement for convenience on 90 days prior written notice, or in the event there is a material, uncured breach of the agreement by the other party.\nIncome tax expense consists of U.S. federal and state income taxes as well as deferred tax benefits. To date, we have not been required to pay U.S. federal income taxes because of our current and accumulated net operating losses. Our income tax expense to date relates to income taxes in the states of California and New Jersey. Our tax benefit relates to Korea and the Inex Bio acquisition.\n \u00b7 the number of sites included in the clinical trials; \nCollaboration Agreements\n \u00b7 the length of time required to enroll eligible patients; \nDuring the periods presented, we did not have, nor do we currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined under SEC rules.\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We continually evaluate our estimates and judgments, the most critical of which are those related to income taxes and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash provided by financing activities consisted of $0.7 million in net proceeds from our debt and equity offerings and $0.2 million in payments received for prior issuance of Class B common stock.\nWe retain exclusive worldwide rights to clinical and research data, intellectual property and know-how developed with our aNK cells, as well as what we believe is the only clinical grade master cell bank of aNK cells in existence.\nUnder the facility license agreement with NantWorks, we are responsible for costs to build out the laboratory and have incurred costs of approximately $2.0 million as of December 31, 2015 which are reflected as construction in progress. Additionally, in order for the facility to meet our research and development and GMP laboratory specifications, we have made structural changes as part of the conversion from office to laboratory space, and as a result, have concluded that we are deemed owner\u201d of the building (for accounting purposes only) during the construction period. Accordingly, we recorded a non-cash build-to-suit lease asset of $2.7 million on the consolidated balance sheet, representing its estimate of the fair market value of the building, and a corresponding construction build-to-suit lease liability.\nWe categorize leases at their inception as either operating or capital leases. On certain of our lease agreements, we may receive rent holidays and other incentives. We recognize lease costs on a straight-line basis without regard to deferred payment terms, such as rent holidays that defer the commencement date of required payments. Additionally, incentives we receive for leases categorized as operating leases are treated as a reduction of our costs over the term of the agreement.\n \u00b7 the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients; \nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $175.2 million, which was primarily attributable to $198.1 million of purchases of marketable securities, $2.2 million purchase of property and equipment, primarily related to our laboratory and GMP build out in Culver City, California, and a $1.8 million purchase of the remaining equity interest from unrelated third parties in Inex Bio. This was partially offset by $26.9 million in sales of equity investments.\nInvesting Activities\nRevenue increased $41,000 during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to earning a $0.2 million commercial license fee associated with one of our licensees' first commercial sale of a product developed using our intellectual property and cell lines. This increase was partially offset by a $0.1 million decrease in upfront and annual research license fees during the year ended December 31, 2014, due primarily to the timing of revenue recognition and a net decrease in the number of license agreements.\nWhen entering into an agreement, we first determine whether the agreement includes multiple deliverables and is subject to accounting guidance in Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Subtopic 605-25, Multiple-Element Arrangements. If we determine that an agreement includes multiple elements, we determine whether the agreement should be divided into separate units of accounting and how the agreement consideration should be measured and allocated among the separate units of accounting.\n \u00b7 hire clinical, manufacturing, scientific and other personnel to support our product candidates development and future commercialization efforts; \nSince our inception in 2002, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the discovery and development of our product candidates, including conducting clinical trials, and funding general and administrative support for these operations. To date, we have generated minimal revenue from non-exclusive license agreements with numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies granting the right to use our cell lines and intellectual property for non-clinical use. As described below, on June 9, 2015, we spun out these non-exclusive license agreements for non-clinical uses to Brink Biologics, Inc. (Brink Biologics) in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Brink Biologics, which were subsequently distributed by a dividend to our stockholders. We have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have incurred net losses in each year since our inception and, as of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $250.4 million. Our net losses were approximately $236.9 million and $6.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Substantially all of our net losses resulted from stock-based compensation expense and costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from selling, general and administrative costs associated with our operations.\n \u00b7 seek to comply with regulatory standards and laws; \nWe expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase for the foreseeable future as we expand operations, internalize the manufacturing of our product candidates (including costs related to building out a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility as well as hiring additional employees to support our manufacturing and processing department), and operate as a public reporting company (including increased fees for outside consultants, lawyers and accountants, as well as increased directors' and officers' liability insurance premiums). We have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur in the future additional costs associated with operating as a public company, including costs to comply with stock exchange listing and SEC requirements, corporate governance, internal controls, investor relations, disclosure and similar requirements applicable to public companies. Additionally, if and when we believe that a regulatory approval of a product candidate appears likely, we expect to incur significant increases in our selling, general and administrative expenses relating to the sales and marketing of the approved product candidate.\n \u00b7 the timing of, and the costs involved in, preclinical and clinical development and obtaining any regulatory approvals for our product candidates; \nSources of Liquidity\n \u00b7 the degree and rate of market acceptance of any approved products; \n \u00b7 potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies; \nIn June 2015, we entered into an agreement with NanoCav, LLC, or NanoCav, pursuant to which we obtained access to NanoCav's virus-free cell transfection technologies on a non-exclusive basis. Under the agreement, NanoCav will conduct certain, mutually-agreed feasibility studies, on a fee for service basis, to evaluate the use of its cell transfection technologies with our aNK cells. We may elect to obtain NanoCav's cell transfection equipment, and rights to its associated protocols and other intellectual property, for use only for pre-clinical research, or also for use in clinical and commercial applications. If we choose to qualify the equipment and technologies for current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, use with our products, we are obligated to pay NanoCav an annual license fee, which is determined based upon whether we elect to use NanoCav's technologies for pre-clinical purposes only, or also for clinical and commercial purposes. In addition, if we use the equipment for clinical and commercial purposes, we are obligated to pay an equipment fee on a cost-plus basis. We are also obligated to purchase any consumables we require to use with the NanoCav technologies from NanoCav, and to pay for those consumables on a cost-plus basis. We have made a feasibility study retainer payment of $45,000. The agreement has an initial term of five years and renews automatically for successive one year periods, unless terminated. We have the right to terminate the agreement for convenience on 90 days prior written notice, and both NanoCav and we may terminate if there is a material, uncured breach of the agreement by the other party.\n \u00b7 seek to discover and develop additional product candidates; \nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk factors\u201d section of this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\n \u00b7 our relative responsibility for developing and commercializing taNK product candidates covered by our joint development and license agreement with Sorrento Therapeutics; \nUtilization of Net Operating Loss Carryforwards (NOLs) and Research and Development Credits\n \u00b7 potentially seek regulatory approval for our product candidates; \n \u00b7 the countries in which the clinical trials are conducted; \nOur Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Soon-Shiong, founded and has a controlling interest in NantWorks, LLC (NantWorks), which is a collection of multiple companies in the healthcare and technology space. We have entered into arrangements with certain affiliates of NantWorks described below that, taken together, we expect will facilitate the development of new genetically modified NK cells for our product pipeline.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $175.9 million compared to $59.1 million as of December 31, 2014. In addition, investments in marketable securities were $173.4 million, of which $118.3 million were short-term investments as compared to no marketable securities as of December 31, 2014.\nRevenue\n \u00b7 establish a commercialization infrastructure and scale up our manufacturing and distribution capabilities to commercialize any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval; \nIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments when the Terms of an Award Provide that a Performance Target Could Be Achieved After the Requisite Service Period, or ASU 2014-12. The ASU requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. ASU 2014-12 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted. We are early adopting ASU 2015-02 for the year ended December 31, 2015. This standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe do not expect any of our product candidates to be commercially available for at least the next several years, if ever.\nWe record our available-for-sale investments at fair value. At December 31, 2015, our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities totaled $191.5 million. FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820, establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value (see Note 4 Financial Statement Details\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). Each level of input represents varying degrees of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value. Valuations using Level 1 and 2 inputs are generally based on price quotations and other observable inputs in active markets and do not require significant management judgment or estimation. We utilize a third-party pricing service to assist us in obtaining fair value pricing for these investments. While pricing for these securities is based on proprietary models, the inputs used are based on observable market information; therefore we have classified our inputs as Level 1 and Level 2.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02), which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for operating leases with lease terms greater than twelve months in the balance sheet. The update also requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on its financial statements and disclosures.\n \u00b7 potentially seek regulatory approval for our product candidates; \nOther expense increased by $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This change was primarily attributable to a $0.8 million increase in the fair value adjustment related to our derivative warrant liability.", "item_7_text": "We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to the future net cash flows which the assets are expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the projected undiscounted future cash flows arising from the asset using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent to the Company's current business model.\n(1) This obligation is measured in Euros, but shown in US dollars using the exchange rate as of December 31, 2015.\n \u00b7 add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel; and \nIn February 2015, following Dr. Soon-Shiong and Dr. Henry Ji, one of our former directors, joining us, we determined that reacquiring the rights licensed in certain Asian countries was of strategic importance to our future potential commercial strategy. Drs. Soon-Shiong and Ji, one of our former directors, helped facilitate our reacquisition of these rights through the acquisition of Inex Bio, using their relationships with the other Inex Bio stockholders. Drs. Soon-Shiong and Ji facilitated the acquisition through the formation of Inex Bio Holdings, LLC, or Inex Bio Holdings, which purchased shares of Inex Bio from third party stockholders. Following this acquisition, Cambridge Equities, LP, an entity of which Dr. Soon-Shiong is the sole member of its general partner, and Eragon Ventures, LLC, an entity of which Dr. Ji was the managing member, each owned fifty percent (50%) of InexBio Holdings.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our net cash used in operating activities of $25.3 million consisted of a net loss of $236.9 million, primarily attributable to $211.2 million in stock compensation expense, $5.4 million cash compensation expense to our Chief Executive Officer and a former director in association with the acquisition of Inex Bio, as well as increases in legal expenses primarily to protect and maintain our patents and spending on research and development efforts. This was partially adjusted by $211.3 million for non-cash items and $0.3 million of cash provided in changes in working capital. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of the $211.2 million in stock-based compensation, $1.5 million in depreciation and amortization, and $1.4 million change in fair value of our derivative warrant liability, partially offset by $2.5 million gain on sales of marketable securities and $0.3 million in a deferred tax benefit. Changes in working capital consisted primarily of increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $2.6 million, due to related parties of $1.4 million and $0.9 million of deferred rent partially offset by an increase of $4.5 million of other current and non-current assets and $0.1 million decrease in deferred revenue.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nLicense rights and non-contingent deliverables, such as knowledge transfer, do not have standalone value as they are not sold separately and they cannot be resold and, consequently are considered a single unit of accounting. Therefore, license revenue in the form of upfront fees is deferred and recognized over the applicable relationship period, which historically has been the estimated period of the Company's substantive performance obligations or the period the rights granted are in effect.\nIn November 2015, we entered into a facility license agreement with NantWorks, effective in May 2015, for approximately 9,500 square feet of office space in Culver City, California, which is to be converted to a research and development laboratory and a Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, laboratory. The term of the license extends through December 2020. We have the option to extend the license through December 2023. The monthly license fee is $47,000 with annual increases of three percent (3%) beginning in January 2017. Additional terms for the license shall be determined at fair market value. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded rent expense of $0.2 million, included in research and development on the consolidated statement of operations.\nSorrento Therapeutics. In December 2014, we entered into a global/exclusive collaboration with Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc., or Sorrento, to jointly develop taNK product candidates as may be agreed between the parties. This transaction allows us to leverage Sorrento's proprietary G-MAB technology platform, one of the largest fully human antibody libraries in the world, to source CARs for our taNK product candidates. The economics from each product candidate will be dependent on the proportion of the development costs that each party contributes. As of the date hereof, the parties have not yet agreed upon any projects under the Joint Development and License Agreement; therefore Sorrento has no rights to use our NK cells or other technologies or intellectual property rights or to begin related research, development or commercialization activities and we are free to pursue, and are actively pursuing, research, development and commercialization activities with antibodies that may bind to various targets, including PDL1, ROR-1, CD33 and CD123.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense, Net\n \u00b7 incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating as a public company. \nOur Integrated Discovery Ecosystem for Precision Medicine. In order to effectively target newly discovered neoepitopes, we plan to integrate the following ecosystem to help drive the development of genetically modified NK cells anticipated to be directed against these cancer-promoting mutated proteins: (1) a high-speed supercomputing infrastructure to help identify both known antigens on the surface of tumor cells and neoepitopes in clinical patients suffering from cancer, in a timely manner and at large scale; (2) a next-generation genomic and transcriptomic sequencing infrastructure to identify the expression of the neoepitopes on the surface of the tumor cell, GPS Cancer developed by our affiliate entity NantOmics; (3) delivering the neoepitope via an adenoviral vector developed by an affiliate entity to induce IgG1 in-vivo production and ADCC activity by our High Affinity NK Cell (haNK) (4) a diverse library of human antibodies from which to interrogate and extract an antibody matching the neoepitope; and (5) an aNK and haNK cell potentially capable of being produced as a scalable cell-based off-the-shelf\u201d therapy without the need for patient compatibility matching. We expect to regularly add newly discovered neoepitopes from our discovery engine, and we believe the thousands of newly discovered antigens selectively expressed on the cancer cells and not on the essential normal tissue will provide us with the ability to create new and targeted libraries of antibodies to be potentially delivered as living drugs for metastatic cancer cells and cancer stem cells.\nInex Bio Acquisition\nBecause all of our product candidates are in the early stages of preclinical and clinical development and the outcome of these efforts is uncertain, we cannot estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of any of our product candidates or whether, or when, we may achieve profitability. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and/or licensing arrangements. We do not have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical partners, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market our product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was $64.4 million and consisted of $63.1 million of net proceeds from our debt and equity offerings, $1.2 million in payments received for prior issuance of Class B common stock and $0.2 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $0.1 million related to payments on the notes payable.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n \u00b7 the emergence, approval, availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of other products or treatments; \nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n \u00b7 add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel; and \n \u00b7 clinical trial and regulatory-related costs; \n \u00b7 the expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel; \n \u00b7 the number of patients that participate in the clinical trials; \nIn July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exist, or ASU 2013-11. ASU 2013-11 amends the presentation requirements of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, and requires an unrecognized tax benefit to be presented in the consolidated financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a NOL carryforward, similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward. To the extent the tax benefit is not available at the reporting date under the governing tax law or if the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented as a liability and not combined with deferred tax assets. ASU 2013-11 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013. The amendments are to be applied to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist as of the effective date and may be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented. The adoption of ASU 2013-11 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, or ASU 2014-15, which amends ASC Subtopic 205-40 to provide guidance about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related disclosures. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt,\u201d (2) require an evaluation every reporting period, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management's plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management's plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that consolidated financial statements are issued. ASU 2014-15 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. We do not plan on early adopting this standard, but it will not have a material impact on our financial condition.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) consists primarily of income from our investments in marketable securities, non-cash costs related to fair value adjustments to our derivative warrant liability, debt discount to interest expense, equity in loss of Inex Bio, and foreign currency transaction expense. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded investment income from cash received for interest, dividends and realized gains on the sale of equity securities of $ 3.0 million, which was partially offset by $38,000 of non-cash costs related to the amortization of our investment net premium position. We were also relieved of our note payable outstanding as of December 31, 2014. The relief of debt is recorded in other income (expense).\nWe are a pioneering clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on harnessing the power of the innate immune system by using the natural killer cell to treat cancer, infectious diseases and inflammatory diseases. Natural killer, or NK, cells are the body's first line of defense due to their innate ability to rapidly seek and destroy abnormal cells, such as cancer or virally-infected cells, without prior exposure or activation by other support molecules required to activate adaptive immune cells such as T-cells.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810)-Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, or ASU 2015-02. ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. Specifically, the amendments (1) modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities (VIEs) or voting interest entities, (2) eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, (3) affect the consolidated analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, and (4) provide a scope exception for certain entities. ASU 2015-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We are early adopting this for the year ended December 31, 2015. This standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2015, we entered into a lease agreement for an approximate 44,681 square foot facility in San Diego, California for research and development laboratory, related office and other related uses. The term of the lease extends for seven years commencing on August 1, 2016. The base rent is $0.2 million per month with 3% annual increase each anniversary date. In July 2015, we entered into a sublease for the building with the current lessee for a term of one year commencing August 1, 2015. There is no fixed rent or operating expenses due by us during the sublease term other than utilities.\n \u00b7 the number and characteristics of any other product candidates we develop or acquire; \nThe following table sets forth our primary sources and uses of cash the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nRevenue decreased $0.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was attributable to earning $0.2 million in commercial license fees associated with one of our licensees' first commercial sale of a product developed using our intellectual property and cell lines in 2014 that did not re-occur in 2015. Additionally, $0.2 million of the decrease was attributable to the transfer to Brink Biologics at the beginning of June 2015 of all of our then-existing, revenue-earning, non-exclusive license agreements that allow third parties to use our cell line and intellectual property for non-clinical laboratory testing as discussed above under the heading Spin-Out of Testing and Diagnostic Products and Services.\u201d As a result of this spin-out, we will no longer receive revenue from these agreements.\nWe account for stock-based compensation under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values on the grant date. We estimate the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, or Black-Scholes model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods using the straight-line method. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise our estimate in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. See Note 13 of our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our equity compensation programs and the fair value assumptions used to determine our stock-based compensation expense.\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased $223.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to $209.3 million in stock compensation expense, of which $141.9 million is related to service and performance based criteria applicable to a warrant granted to Dr. Soon-Shiong, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Warrant Agreement, or the Warrant Agreement. The stock compensation expense related to the Warrant Agreement includes $114.5 million for the achievement of a financing transaction with a strategic partner, which triggered the vesting of 8,331,750 warrant shares in the second quarter of 2015, $22.9 million related to service-based vesting and $4.5 million related to another performance milestone where achievement is deemed probable. In addition to the impact of the Warrant Agreement, the increase in stock compensation included $38.2 million related to stock options and restricted stock units, or RSUs, also granted to our Dr. Soon-Shiong and to Dr. Simon, our President and Chief Operating Officer, $22.7 million related to grants to Dr. Soon-Shiong and a former director for their assistance in connection with the asset purchase of Inex Bio and $6.5 million related to stock options and RSUs issued to employees and non-employees. We expect our stock based compensation expense included in selling, general, and administrative expense to decrease significantly for the foreseeable future.\n \u00b7 employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation; and \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\n \u00b7 maintain, leverage and expand our intellectual property portfolio; \nThe costs of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project owing to, but not limited to, the following:\nSelling, General and Administrative\n \u00b7 the costs associated with being a public company; \nFinancing Activities\n \u00b7 the costs of manufacturing, distributing and processing our product candidates; \n\nLease Obligations\nResearch and development expense increased $9.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to $2.5 million in laboratory and clinical trial expenses, $1.7 million in compensation expense related to increased staff, consultant costs, and shared services, $1.6 million for new lab and manufacturing facility expenses, $1.5 million payment for initial license fees under a license agreement, $1.3 million in amortization of intangible assets from the Inex Bio acquisition, and $1.1 million for stock compensation expense related to consultants and an increase in staffing. We expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as we advance an increased number of our product candidates through clinical development and conduct our planned clinical trials.\nResults of Operations\n \u00b7 the number of doses that patients receive; \nIn May 2014, the FASB issued guidance codified in ASC Topic 606, ASU 2014-09, Revenue Recognition-Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which amends the guidance in former ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and was initially to be effective beginning January 1, 2017. This guidance requires that entities recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of ASC Topic 606 on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. On August 12, 2015, the FASB issued guidance which defers the effective date of ASC Topic 606 by one year to January 1, 2018.\nOperating Expenses\n \u00b7 the cost of comparative agents used in clinical trials; \nOn June 9, 2015, we spun out our business relating to testing and diagnostic products and services to Brink Biologics in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Brink Biologics. We subsequently distributed the shares of Brink Biologics by a dividend to our stockholders of record on June 9, 2015, on a pro rata basis. Under the spin-out arrangement, we transferred to Brink Biologics all of our existing, revenue-earning, non-exclusive license agreements that allow third parties to use our cell lines and intellectual property for non-clinical laboratory testing, and also transferred or licensed to Brink Biologics our other assets pertaining to testing and diagnostics products and services. Our board of directors determined that our strategic focus is to utilize our resources to pursue the potential treatment of cancer, infectious diseases and inflammatory diseases, rather than to utilize our resources and intellectual property to focus on non-clinical laboratory testing for minimal revenue opportunities as compared to the potential market opportunity that may exist for our therapeutic focus. We granted to Brink Biologics worldwide, exclusive licenses, for use only in the field of in vitro and in vivo testing and diagnostic products and services and under certain cell lines, trademarks, know-how and patents, including the intellectual property rights licensed to us under our license agreement with Fox Chase Cancer Center. Brink Biologics is restricted in its ability to modify the licensed cell lines, and we will have at least joint ownership of any such modifications and the ability to use those modifications outside Brink Biologics' field. We also have a non-exclusive license to any results and data arising from Brink Biologics' use of our cell lines and intellectual property for our use for internal research purposes and outside of Brink Biologics' field. In consideration for the license grants, Brink Biologics is obligated to pay us a low single-digit royalty on amounts received for the sale of licensed products and services, as well as a low single-digit percentage share of other revenue received by Brink Biologics from the grant of sublicenses under our rights. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded $11,000 in revenue for royalties. Brink Biologics has the right to terminate the license agreement for convenience. We have the right to terminate the license agreement if Brink Biologics challenges any of our patents or the patents licensed to us by Fox Chase Cancer Center. We and Brink Biologics each have the right to terminate the license agreement if the other party is dissolved or is declared bankrupt, or remains in breach of any material obligation following a sixty day cure period to remedy the breach. Also, as part of the spin-out arrangement, we have agreed to provide certain services to Brink Biologics for a transitional period on a fee-for-service basis. As of December 31, 2015, we invoiced Brink Biologics for service fees in the amount of $22,000 which is recorded in other income on our consolidated statements of operations. Had we consummated the spin-out as of the beginning of the year, for the year ended December 31, 2015, our revenue would have been $26,000 and selling, general and administrative expense would still have been $227.7 million. There is no impact to our consolidated balance sheet because the spin-out occurred at the beginning of June. Accordingly, it is already reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. We further determined that we have a variable interest in Brink Biologics through our royalty agreement with them. However, we are not the primary beneficiary, and as such, do not consolidate the entity.\nIn May 2012, we acquired 57,000 shares of Inex Bio for $0.2 million, which represented 22.2% of the outstanding shares and 17.4% of the fully-diluted shares of Inex Bio. At that time, Inex Bio had only one other stockholder and one option holder.\n\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2015 for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\nIn April 2012, we made a strategic decision to enter into a License Agreement, or the Inex License Agreement, with Inex Bio, Inc. or Inex Bio, a Republic of Korea corporation. Under the Inex License Agreement, we provided Inex Bio with an exclusive license to our technology to be used in products only in certain Asian countries. In exchange for the exclusive license, we received a $0.3 million up-front license fee. In addition, we are entitled to receive milestone payments of up to $0.8 million based upon the completion of certain clinical trials and a 5% royalty on the net sales of applicable products using our aNK cells. No milestone payments or royalties have ever been due or received under this agreement.\nIn November 2015, we entered into a shared services agreement with NantWorks under which NantWorks will provide corporate, general and administrative, manufacturing strategy, regulatory and clinical trial strategy and other support services to us. We will be charged for the services at cost plus reasonable allocations for indirect costs that relate to the employees providing the services. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded operating expenses of $0.3 million to research and development and $1.0 million to selling, general and administrative on the consolidated statement of operations under this arrangement.\n \u00b7 establish a commercialization infrastructure and scale up our manufacturing and distribution capabilities to commercialize any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval; \n \u00b7 facility expenses dedicated to research and development. \nBased upon our current operating plan, we expect that the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the concurrent private placement, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures requirements for at least the next 24 months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. The successful development of any product candidate is highly uncertain. Due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates, if approved, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the development of our product candidates.\nWe record any amounts received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nWe do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, which we do not expect to happen for at least the next several years, if ever. Until such time that we can generate substantial revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operating activities through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition and could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our research and development programs or commercialization efforts. Failure to receive additional funding could cause us to cease operations, in part or in full.\nOn March 30, 2015, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with InexBio Holdings and certain other parties, or the purchase agreement, pursuant to which we acquired all the remaining outstanding shares of Inex Bio not previously owned by us for cash consideration of $8.0 million and the issuance of a warrant to purchase 3,202,593 shares of our Class A common stock at an exercise price of $2.00 per share. We paid (1) $1.5 million in cash and warrants to purchase 593,072 shares of our Class A common stock valued at approximately $5.2 million to the third party stockholders; and (2) $6.5 million of cash and warrants to purchase 2,609,520 shares of our Class A common stock valued at $22.7 million to Inex Bio Holdings. The purpose of providing the warrants was primarily to avoid having to use additional cash consideration for the acquisition. In addition, the subsequent exercise of the warrants by InexBio Holdings and other former shareholders of Inex Bio provided us with additional cash to fund our own operations. At the time of our acquisition of the remaining shares of Inex Bio, Dr. Simon, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and one of our former directors, was on the board of directors of Inex Bio. Subsequent to the closing of the transaction, InexBio Holdings exercised the warrant we issued in connection with the transaction for 2,609,520 shares of our common stock for aggregate cash consideration to us of $5.2 million.\nResearch and development expense consists of expenses incurred while performing research and development activities to discover and develop our product candidates. This includes conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, manufacturing development efforts and activities related to regulatory filings for product candidates. We recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred. Our research and development expense primarily consists of:\nLeases\nOther Income (Expense)\n(1) Amounts reflected in the table for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, have been retrospectively adjusted to apply a change in the method of accounting for patent costs we adopted on December 31, 2015. See Note 15 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nWe recognize a milestone payment when earned if it is substantive and we have no ongoing performance obligations related to the milestone. A milestone payment is considered substantive if it: (1) is commensurate with either the performance to achieve the milestone or the enhanced value of the delivered item as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the performance to achieve the milestone; (2) relates solely to past performance; and (3) is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms, including other potential milestone consideration, within the agreement.\nFrom June 10, 2015 through July 8, 2015, we raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately $78.0 million from the sale of common stock in a series of private placement transactions to third parties. On June 18, 2015, we repurchased 249,952 shares of common stock from an employee at $19.20 per share for approximately $4.8 million.\nWe recorded long-lived assets that include property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Furthermore, we are deemed to be the owner, for accounting purposes, during the construction phase of certain long-lived assets under build-to-suit lease arrangements because of our involvement with the construction, our exposure to any potential cost overruns and our other commitments under the arrangements. In these cases, we recognize a build-to-suit lease asset under construction and a corresponding build-to-suit lease liability on the consolidated balance sheets.\nIn July 2015, the Company entered into a lease agreement for approximately 3,067 square feet of office space in Cary, North Carolina. The term of the lease is 26 months commencing on July 1, 2015. The monthly base rent is $6,070 with 3% annual increases on each anniversary date.\nSelling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel-related costs, including employee benefits and any stock-based compensation, for employees performing functions other than research and development. This includes personnel in executive, finance, human resources and administrative support functions. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs not otherwise allocated to research and development expense, professional fees for auditing, tax and legal services, advertising costs, expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining patents, consulting costs, royalties and licensing costs, and costs of our information systems.\nOur targeted therapeutic areas include: (1) cancer, focusing on bulky hematological cancers and solid tumors as well as cancer stem cells, (2) infectious diseases, including viral, fungal and bacterial infections, and (3) inflammatory diseases, ranging from rare inherited diseases to more prevalent autoimmune disorders.\nAs of December 31, 2015 we had 31 employees and currently, we have 41 employees. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $317.3 million, which consisted mainly of $316.5 million in net proceeds from our equity offerings, consisting of $221.5 million from our IPO, $78.0 million from a pre-IPO stock issuance, and $17.0 million from a private stock placement concurrent with the IPO. Additionally, $7.3 million in cash was provided from the exercise of warrants ($5.2 million of which were issued in conjunction with the acquisition of Inex Bio), and $0.9 million from the exercise of stock options. This was partially offset by a $4.8 million payment to repurchase shares of our common stock from an employee and $2.4 million of payroll taxes related to net share settlement of RSUs.\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carry forwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. Although we have not completed a study to determine the impact of ownership changes on our NOLs, we believe that we have recently undergone one or more ownership changes and accordingly, our ability to use our NOLs will be limited.\nComponents of our Results of Operations\nMultiple Modes of Tumor Cell Killing. Our immuno-oncology NK platform has multiple modes to potentially induce cell death against the tumor or infected cell by: (1) direct killing by binding to stress ligands expressed by the diseased cell with the release of toxic granules directly into the tumor cell; (2) antibody mediated killing by binding to antibodies administered in combination and enhancing the cancer killing effect of the administered antibody, enabling targeted cell killing through antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity, or ADCC; and (3) target activated killing by binding to known or newly discovered tumor-specific antigens expressed on the surface of tumor cells and inducing cell death by the release of toxic granules directly into the tumor cell and by the release of cytokines and chemokines which recruit additional innate and adaptive immune responses, including the recruitment of cytotoxic T-cells.\nOperating Activities\nOverview\nIn June 2015, we spun out Brink Biologics, Inc., or Brink Biologics, and Coneksis, Inc., or Coneksis. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has a controlling interest in Brink Biologics and Coneksis. For a description of each of these transactions see the disclosure under Spin-Out of Testing and Diagnostic Products and Services\u201d and Spin-Out of Veterinary Oncology Rights\u201d below.\nSubstantially all of our research and development expenses to date have been incurred in connection with our product candidates. We expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as we advance an increased number of our product candidates through clinical development, including the conduct of our planned clinical trials. The process of conducting clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming. The successful development of product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing or costs required to complete the remaining development of any product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of product candidates.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, our net cash used in operating activities of $0.7 million consisted of a net loss of $2.0 million, primarily attributable to our spending on research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses, partially adjusted by $0.5 million for non-cash items and $0.9 million of cash provided by changes in working capital. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $0.9 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.3 million of amortization of the debt discount, partially offset by the change in fair value of our derivative warrant liability of $0.7 million. Changes in working capital consisted primarily of an increase in accounts payable of $0.7 million.\nJOBS Act\nMarketable Securities\nWe are responsible for costs to build out the laboratory and have incurred costs of approximately $2.0 million as of December 31, 2015 which are reflected in construction in progress on the consolidated balance sheet. See Notes 8 and 9 of our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our lease obligations and related party transactions, respectively.\n \u00b7 continue research and development, including preclinical and clinical development of our existing product candidates; \nSpin-Out of Veterinary Oncology Rights\n \u00b7 the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate. \nIncome Tax\n \u00b7 incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating as a public company. \n \u00b7 the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing intellectual property claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation; \nWe established assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred under build-to-suit lease arrangements to the extent we are involved in the construction of structural improvements or take construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. Upon occupancy of facilities under build-to-suit leases, we assess whether these arrangements qualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance. If we continue to be the deemed owner, the facilities are accounted for as financing leases.\nAgreements with Affiliates of NantWorks\nUntil the second quarter of 2015, we had common stock warrants that met the definition of derivative financial instruments and were accounted for as a derivative liability. The fair value of this warrant derivative liability was based on a Monte Carlo simulation model at each reporting period. Estimating the fair value of the underlying shares was highly complex and subjective because our stock was not publicly traded at the time. The derivative warrant liability for the common stock warrants was $0 and $0.2 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nStock-based Compensation\nFuture Funding Requirements\nIn addition, there were increases of $8.1 million in salaries, personnel-related and shared service costs, of which $5.4 million is cash consideration paid to our CEO and a former director in association with the acquisition of Inex Bio, $1.6 million is related to an increase in staffing, and $1.0 million is related to shared service costs. There were also increases in expenses of $2.1 million for legal costs primarily to protect and maintain our patents and a $1.4 million increase related to becoming and operating as a public company including director and office insurance premiums, legal fees and registration fees. There was also an increase of $1.2 million for accounting and public relations services as well as $1.0 million in increased travel expenses. These increases were partially offset by a $0.2 million decrease in royalties and cost of licensing, which was primarily attributable to the transfer of the majority of our existing revenue-earning, non-exclusive license agreements that allow third parties to use our cell line and intellectual property for non-clinical laboratory testing to Brink Biologics at the beginning of June 2015.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, or ASU 2015-17, which eliminates the current requirement for reporting entities to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead, reporting entities will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. This guidance is effective for consolidated financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are early adopting this standard for the December 31, 2015 financial statements on a prospective basis and this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe that our proprietary NK cell line, coupled with our planned integrated discovery ecosystem, positions us to implement precision cancer medicine by leveraging the advances that have evolved during the past decade and addressing newly discovered challenges of cancer. Cancer is only recently understood to be a complex of rare diseases, with hundreds of patient-specific, cancer-promoting mutated proteins, some known and many more unknown called neoepitopes. Identifying and targeting these mutated proteins is our strategy to overcome the challenges of cancer in the era of genomics, transcriptomics and immuno-oncology. We believe neoepitopes, which are newly discovered antigens selectively expressed on the cancer cells and not on the essential normal tissue, represent large untapped targeting opportunities for immune effector cells such as our activated NK cells.\n \u00b7 continue research and development, including preclinical and clinical development of our existing product candidates; \nOn July 31, 2015, we closed the initial public offering, or IPO, of 9,531,200 shares of common stock in which we raised proceeds of $221.5 million after underwriters' discounts and commissions and offering expenses. Concurrently with our initial public offering, we completed a separate private offering of 680,000 shares of common stock in which we raised net proceeds of $17.0 million.\nWe classify our operating expenses into research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs including salaries, benefits, bonuses and specifically stock-based compensation expense comprise a significant component of our research and development and selling, general and administrative expense categories. We allocate expenses associated with our facilities and information technology costs between these two categories based on the nature of each cost.\n \u00b7 seek to discover and develop additional product candidates; \n \u00b7 hire clinical, manufacturing, scientific and other personnel to support our product candidates development and future commercialization efforts; \nIn November 2015, we entered into a facility license agreement with NantWorks, effective in May 2015, for approximately 9,500 square feet of office space in Culver City, California, which is to be converted to a research and development laboratory and a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) laboratory. The term of the license extends through December 2020. We have the option to extend the license through December 2023. The monthly license fee is $47,000 with annual increases of 3% beginning in January 2017. Additional terms for the license shall be determined at fair market value. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded rent expense of $0.2 million, included in research and development on the consolidated statement of operations.\nWe utilize a third party investment manager to handle our excess cash with the following objectives in order of priority: preservation of capital, liquidity, prudent diversification to minimize credit and market risk exposure, optimal safekeeping, control and reporting and maximization of total return. Specific guidelines regarding permitted investments, credit quality and diversification are provided to help clarify our intent.\nOn April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company,\u201d we intend to rely on certain exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act, including those relating to (i) providing an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an emerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (i) the last day of our first fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more, (ii) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer\u201d under the rules of the SEC with at least $700 million of outstanding equity securities held by non-affiliates, (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the previous three years, or (iv) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial public offering.\nIn February and March 2015, InexBio Holdings paid $1.1 million in cash to the third party stockholders to acquire a 67.3% interest in Inex Bio. Following this transaction, we owned a 22.2% interest in Inex Bio, InexBio Holdings owned a 67.3% interest in Inex Bio and the third party stockholders held the remainder of the Inex Bio shares. We believed that it was in our best interest for InexBio Holdings to acquire the shares directly from the third party stockholders of Inex Bio because of Dr. Soon-Shiong's and Dr. Ji's relationships with the stockholders and our belief that this would be the quickest manner to effect the acquisition and at the lowest price.\nAn element qualifies as a separate unit of accounting when the delivered element has standalone value to the customer. Our agreements do not include a general right of return relative to delivered elements. Any delivered elements that do not qualify as separate units of accounting are combined with other undelivered elements within the agreement as a single unit of accounting. If the agreement constitutes a single combined unit of accounting, we determine the revenue recognition method for the combined unit of accounting and recognize the revenue over the period from inception through the date the last deliverable within the single unit of accounting is delivered.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgements and Use of Estimates\nRevenue\nWe account for stock-based compensation awards and warrants granted to non-employees in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees, or ASC 505-50. Under ASC 505-50, we determine the fair value of the warrants or stock-based compensation awards granted as either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. If the fair value of equity instruments issued is used, it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of either (1) the date at which commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached, or (2) the date at which the counterparty's performance is complete.\nSpin-Out of Testing and Diagnostic Products and Services\n \u00b7 maintain, leverage and expand our intellectual property portfolio; \nIncome tax (benefit) expense increased by ($0.3) million during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was attributable to income tax benefits related to losses at InexBio.\nSelling, General and Administrative\n \u00b7 the duration of patient follow-up; and \nResearch and Development\nOn June 9, 2015, we spun out our business relating to veterinary oncology to Coneksis in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Coneksis. We subsequently distributed the shares of Coneksis by a dividend to our stockholders of record on June 9, 2015, on a pro rata basis. In connection with the spin-out arrangement, we granted to Coneksis worldwide, exclusive licenses, for use only in the field of veterinary medical research and therapeutics, under certain cell lines, trademarks, know-how and patents, including the intellectual property rights licensed to us under our license agreement with Fox Chase Cancer Center. Like Brink Biologics, Coneksis is restricted in its ability to modify the licensed cell lines, and we will have at least joint ownership of any such modifications and the ability to use those modifications outside Coneksis' field. We also have a non-exclusive license to any results and data arising from Coneksis' use of our cell lines and intellectual property for our use for internal research purposes and outside of Coneksis' field. In consideration for the license grants, Coneksis is obligated to pay us a low single-digit royalty on amounts received for the sale of licensed products and services, as well as a low single-digit percentage share of other revenue received by Coneksis from the grant of sublicenses under our rights. Coneksis has the right to terminate the license agreement for convenience. We have the right to terminate the license agreement if Coneksis challenges any of our patents or the patents licensed to us by Fox Chase Cancer Center. We and Coneksis each have the right to terminate the license agreement if the other party is dissolved or is declared bankrupt, or remains in breach of any material obligation following a sixty day cure period to remedy the breach. Finally, as part of the spin-out arrangement, we have agreed to provide certain services to Coneksis for a transitional period on a fee-for-service basis. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we invoiced Coneksis for service fees in the amount of $6,000 which is recorded in other income on our consolidated statements of operations. Had we consummated the spin-out as of the beginning of the year, there would have been no material impact to our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015, or our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. We further determined that we have a variable interest in Coneksis through our royalty agreement with them. However, we are not the primary beneficiary, and as such, do not consolidate the entity.\nTo date, we have derived substantially all of our revenue from non-exclusive license agreements with numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies granting them the right to use our cell lines and intellectual property for non-clinical use. These agreements generally include upfront fees and annual research license fees for such use, as well as commercial license fees for sales of our licensee's products developed or manufactured using our intellectual property and cell lines. Our license agreements may also include milestone payments, although to date, we have not generated any revenue from milestone payments. We recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or we have provided the service, the fees are fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We expect our revenue from non-clinical license agreements to decrease to a nominal amount in the future as we have transferred virtually all of our revenue-generating license agreements to Brink Biologics in the spin-out transaction described above. In the future, we may generate revenue from license agreements entered into for therapeutic uses. To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales. If we fail to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner or fail to obtain regulatory approval for them, we may never be able to generate substantial future revenue.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had federal, state and foreign income tax NOLs of approximately $31.6 million, $28.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, which will expire at various dates through 2035. As of December 31, 2015 we also had minimal federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards to offset future income taxes.\n \u00b7 per patient trial costs; \n \u00b7 the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, any approved products; and \nDuring the second quarter of 2015, due to the price at which our common stock sold in a series of private placement transactions, we retroactively reassessed the estimated fair value per share of our common stock for financial reporting purposes. As a result of its reassessment, we determined that, solely for financial reporting purposes, the fair value of its common stock was higher than the fair market values determined in good faith by our board of directors for each of the option grant dates from and after January 2015. The exercise price of $2.00 per share for the warrants issued to InexBio Holdings in March 2015 was based upon the fair market value determined in good faith by our board of directors. As a result of the retroactive reassessment in the second quarter of 2015, the issuance of the warrants resulted in compensation expense to Dr. Soon-Shiong and to Dr. Ji of $22.7 million.\nApplication of New or Revised Accounting Standards-Not Yet Adopted\n \u00b7 our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other commercialization arrangements and the terms and timing of such arrangements; \nCash Flows\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, net cash used in investing activities was $0.2 million and $3,000, respectively, which was attributable to the purchase of property and equipment.\nIn March 2009, we received a final rejection in one of our original patent applications pertaining to certain limited methods of use claims for NK-92 from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the USPTO) (but the USPTO allowed claims on all of the other proposed claims, including other methods of use). We appealed this decision with the USPTO Board of Appeals and, in the fall of 2013, the Board of Appeals reversed the Examiner's rejection of the claim to certain limited methods of use with NK-92, but affirmed the Examiner's rejection of the remaining patent claims. In December 2013, we brought an action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia to review the decision of the USPTO as we disagreed with the decision as to the certain limited non-allowed claims. On September 2, 2015, the U.S. District Court granted the USPTO's motion for summary judgment. We have filed a notice of appeal and will be appealing the decision.\nLong-Lived Assets\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013\nWe anticipate that strategic collaborations will become an integral part of our operations, providing opportunities to leverage our partners' expertise and capabilities to further expand the potential of our technologies and product candidates. We believe we are well positioned to become a leader in cell-based immunotherapy due to our broad and vertically integrated platform and through complementary strategic partnerships.\nApplication of New or Revised Accounting Standards-Adopted\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n \u00b7 seek to comply with regulatory standards and laws; \nIn April 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, which amends ASC 205, Presentation of Financial Statements, and ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment. This ASU changes the criteria for determining which disposals can be presented as a discontinued operation and modifies existing disclosure requirements. The provisions of this update were effective as of January 1, 2015, and we have adopted this standard accordingly.\nRecent Equity Transactions\n \u00b7 manufacturing and testing costs and related supplies and materials; \nWe generate revenue primarily from our non-exclusive license agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies granting them the right to use our cell lines and intellectual property for non-clinical use. These agreements generally include upfront fees and annual research license fees for such use, as well as commercial license fees for sales of our licensee's products developed or manufactured using our intellectual property and cell lines. Our license agreements may also include milestone payments, although to date, we have not generated any revenue from milestone payments. We recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or we have provided the service, the fees are fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.\nIn November 2015, the board of directors approved a share repurchase program allowing our Chief Executive Officer or our Chief Financial Officer, on behalf of the Company, to repurchase from time to time, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, up to $50 million of our outstanding shares of common stock, exclusive of any commissions, markups or expenses. The timing and amounts of any purchases will be based on market conditions and other factors, including price, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations. The program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares and may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time without prior notice. We expect to finance the purchases with existing cash balances. No shares were repurchased as of December 31, 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, our net cash used in operating activities of $5.4 million consisted of a net loss of $6.2 million, primarily attributable to an increase in spending on research and development efforts and selling, general and administrative expenses, and $0.8 million of cash used to fund changes in working capital, partially adjusted by $1.6 million for non-cash items. Changes in working capital consisted primarily of a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $0.7 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $0.8 million of stock-based compensation expense, $0.4 million of amortization of the debt discount, and a change in fair value of our derivative warrant liability of $0.2 million.\n \u00b7 expenses incurred under agreements with investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials; \nContingencies\nResearch and development expense increased by $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily attributable to a $0.6 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs due to an increase in headcount of our research and development personnel, a $0.4 million increase in laboratory and clinical trials expenses and a $0.1 million increase in rent expense for our research and development facilities.\nWe lease a total of approximately 2,550 square feet of office space at 2533 South Coast Highway 101, Cardiff-by-the-Sea, California 92007, for general office use, pursuant to an operating lease. The current lease term is from September 1, 2013 to August 31, 2016. We recently amended this lease to extend the term of the lease through August 31, 2018. Our total monthly lease payment is currently $12,321 per month, through August 31, 2016. Thereafter, the total monthly lease payment will be $12,752 per month, and will increase to $13,199 on September 1, 2017.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nOther income increased $2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to a $3.0 million increase in investment income related to a realized gain of $2.5 million from the sale of equity securities and a $0.5 million increase in dividend and interest income. There was also a reduction of $0.5 million in interest expense as the Company paid off all its debt in 2014. This decrease in expense was partially offset by an increase in the fair value adjustment of $1.2 million related to our derivative warrant liability.\nTo date, we have generated minimal revenue from non-exclusive license agreements with numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies granting the right to use our cell lines and intellectual property for non-clinical use for laboratory testing that were spun out to Brink Biologics on June 9, 2015. We have not generated any revenue from product sales. We do not expect to generate significant revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize any of our product candidates and we do not know when, or if, this will occur. In addition, we expect our expenses to significantly increase in connection with our ongoing development activities, particularly as we continue the research, development and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates. Moreover, since the completion of our IPO in July 2015, we have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur in the future additional costs associated with operating as a public company. In addition, subject to obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses for product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. We anticipate that we will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. We expect that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:\nWe typically use our employee, consultant and infrastructure resources across our development programs. We track outsourced development costs by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs, other internal costs or external consultant costs to specific product candidates or development programs.\nWe record impairment charges through the statement of operations when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary. The determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors. Adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments, thereby requiring recognition of impairment losses. When assessing these investments for an other-than-temporary decline in value, we consider such factors as, among other things, the significance of the decline in value as compared to the cost basis; underlying factors contributing to a decline in the prices of securities in a single asset class; how long the market value of the security has been less than its cost basis; the security's relative performance versus its peers, sector or asset class; expected market volatility; the market and economy in general; analyst recommendations and price targets; views of external investment managers; news or financial information that has been released specific to the investee; and the outlook for the overall industry in which the investee operates, as applicable. If we determine that a security price decline is other than temporary, we record an impairment loss, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased by $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $1.9 million in salaries and personnel-related costs as we prepared to file our registration statement and operate as a public company. Patent filing expenses increased by $0.2 million as we continued to apply for patent protection for our product candidates. Additionally, royalties and cost of licensing increased $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in royalty payments under our in-licensing agreements during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIn 2010, we issued, in conjunction with a termination and release agreement, a warrant to purchase 114,822 shares of Class A common stock. We accounted for the warrant as a derivative liability, which was adjusted to fair value each reporting period. The warrant was exercised in April 2015 and the derivative liability was reclassified to additional paid-in capital.\n \u00b7 any product liability or other lawsuits related to our product candidates. \nWe have not recorded impairment losses to date on our investments in marketable securities as they were so recently acquired. However, given that investments are such a large portion of our asset base, we are doing everything possible to minimize any impact to our liquidity.\nResearch and Development\nIn June 2015, we also entered into a supply agreement with NantCell, Inc., or NantCell pursuant to which we have the right to purchase NantCell's proprietary bioreactors, made according to specifications we mutually agree with NantCell, in such quantities as we may require from time to time during the term of the agreement. We also have the right to purchase reagents and consumables associated with such equipment from NantCell. We made a non-refundable upfront payment to NantCell of $0.5 million, which is creditable against our future equipment purchases under the agreement. We are also obligated to pay for any equipment and consumables we purchase from NantCell on a cost-plus basis. The agreement has an initial term of five years and renews automatically for successive one year periods unless terminated by us or NantCell. We and NantCell have the right to terminate the agreement for convenience on 90 days prior written notice, or in the event there is a material, uncured breach of the agreement by the other party.\n(1) Amounts reflected in the table for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, have been retrospectively adjusted to apply a change in the method of accounting for patent costs we adopted on December 31, 2015. See Note 15 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nIn June 2015, we entered into an agreement with NantOmics, LLC, or NantOmics, to obtain genomic sequencing and proteomic analysis services, as well as related data management and bioinformatics services, exclusively from NantOmics. We will have rights to use the data and results generated from NantOmics' services in connection with the performance of the particular oncology trial with respect to which the services were performed, but NantOmics will own the data and results, as well as any other intellectual property it creates in performing these services for us. We are obligated to pay NantOmics a fixed, per sample fee, determined based on the type of services being provided. The agreement has an initial term of five years and renews automatically for successive one year periods, unless terminated by us or NantOmics. We and NantOmics have the right to terminate the agreement for convenience on 90 days prior written notice, or in the event there is a material, uncured breach of the agreement by the other party.\nIncome tax expense consists of U.S. federal and state income taxes as well as deferred tax benefits. To date, we have not been required to pay U.S. federal income taxes because of our current and accumulated net operating losses. Our income tax expense to date relates to income taxes in the states of California and New Jersey. Our tax benefit relates to Korea and the Inex Bio acquisition.\n \u00b7 the number of sites included in the clinical trials; \nCollaboration Agreements\n \u00b7 the length of time required to enroll eligible patients; \nDuring the periods presented, we did not have, nor do we currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined under SEC rules.\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We continually evaluate our estimates and judgments, the most critical of which are those related to income taxes and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash provided by financing activities consisted of $0.7 million in net proceeds from our debt and equity offerings and $0.2 million in payments received for prior issuance of Class B common stock.\nWe retain exclusive worldwide rights to clinical and research data, intellectual property and know-how developed with our aNK cells, as well as what we believe is the only clinical grade master cell bank of aNK cells in existence.\nUnder the facility license agreement with NantWorks, we are responsible for costs to build out the laboratory and have incurred costs of approximately $2.0 million as of December 31, 2015 which are reflected as construction in progress. Additionally, in order for the facility to meet our research and development and GMP laboratory specifications, we have made structural changes as part of the conversion from office to laboratory space, and as a result, have concluded that we are deemed owner\u201d of the building (for accounting purposes only) during the construction period. Accordingly, we recorded a non-cash build-to-suit lease asset of $2.7 million on the consolidated balance sheet, representing its estimate of the fair market value of the building, and a corresponding construction build-to-suit lease liability.\nWe categorize leases at their inception as either operating or capital leases. On certain of our lease agreements, we may receive rent holidays and other incentives. We recognize lease costs on a straight-line basis without regard to deferred payment terms, such as rent holidays that defer the commencement date of required payments. Additionally, incentives we receive for leases categorized as operating leases are treated as a reduction of our costs over the term of the agreement.\n \u00b7 the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients; \nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $175.2 million, which was primarily attributable to $198.1 million of purchases of marketable securities, $2.2 million purchase of property and equipment, primarily related to our laboratory and GMP build out in Culver City, California, and a $1.8 million purchase of the remaining equity interest from unrelated third parties in Inex Bio. This was partially offset by $26.9 million in sales of equity investments.\nInvesting Activities\nRevenue increased $41,000 during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to earning a $0.2 million commercial license fee associated with one of our licensees' first commercial sale of a product developed using our intellectual property and cell lines. This increase was partially offset by a $0.1 million decrease in upfront and annual research license fees during the year ended December 31, 2014, due primarily to the timing of revenue recognition and a net decrease in the number of license agreements.\nWhen entering into an agreement, we first determine whether the agreement includes multiple deliverables and is subject to accounting guidance in Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Subtopic 605-25, Multiple-Element Arrangements. If we determine that an agreement includes multiple elements, we determine whether the agreement should be divided into separate units of accounting and how the agreement consideration should be measured and allocated among the separate units of accounting.\n \u00b7 hire clinical, manufacturing, scientific and other personnel to support our product candidates development and future commercialization efforts; \nSince our inception in 2002, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the discovery and development of our product candidates, including conducting clinical trials, and funding general and administrative support for these operations. To date, we have generated minimal revenue from non-exclusive license agreements with numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies granting the right to use our cell lines and intellectual property for non-clinical use. As described below, on June 9, 2015, we spun out these non-exclusive license agreements for non-clinical uses to Brink Biologics, Inc. (Brink Biologics) in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Brink Biologics, which were subsequently distributed by a dividend to our stockholders. We have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have incurred net losses in each year since our inception and, as of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $250.4 million. Our net losses were approximately $236.9 million and $6.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Substantially all of our net losses resulted from stock-based compensation expense and costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from selling, general and administrative costs associated with our operations.\n \u00b7 seek to comply with regulatory standards and laws; \nWe expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase for the foreseeable future as we expand operations, internalize the manufacturing of our product candidates (including costs related to building out a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility as well as hiring additional employees to support our manufacturing and processing department), and operate as a public reporting company (including increased fees for outside consultants, lawyers and accountants, as well as increased directors' and officers' liability insurance premiums). We have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur in the future additional costs associated with operating as a public company, including costs to comply with stock exchange listing and SEC requirements, corporate governance, internal controls, investor relations, disclosure and similar requirements applicable to public companies. Additionally, if and when we believe that a regulatory approval of a product candidate appears likely, we expect to incur significant increases in our selling, general and administrative expenses relating to the sales and marketing of the approved product candidate.\n \u00b7 the timing of, and the costs involved in, preclinical and clinical development and obtaining any regulatory approvals for our product candidates; \nSources of Liquidity\n \u00b7 the degree and rate of market acceptance of any approved products; \n \u00b7 potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies; \nIn June 2015, we entered into an agreement with NanoCav, LLC, or NanoCav, pursuant to which we obtained access to NanoCav's virus-free cell transfection technologies on a non-exclusive basis. Under the agreement, NanoCav will conduct certain, mutually-agreed feasibility studies, on a fee for service basis, to evaluate the use of its cell transfection technologies with our aNK cells. We may elect to obtain NanoCav's cell transfection equipment, and rights to its associated protocols and other intellectual property, for use only for pre-clinical research, or also for use in clinical and commercial applications. If we choose to qualify the equipment and technologies for current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, use with our products, we are obligated to pay NanoCav an annual license fee, which is determined based upon whether we elect to use NanoCav's technologies for pre-clinical purposes only, or also for clinical and commercial purposes. In addition, if we use the equipment for clinical and commercial purposes, we are obligated to pay an equipment fee on a cost-plus basis. We are also obligated to purchase any consumables we require to use with the NanoCav technologies from NanoCav, and to pay for those consumables on a cost-plus basis. We have made a feasibility study retainer payment of $45,000. The agreement has an initial term of five years and renews automatically for successive one year periods, unless terminated. We have the right to terminate the agreement for convenience on 90 days prior written notice, and both NanoCav and we may terminate if there is a material, uncured breach of the agreement by the other party.\n \u00b7 seek to discover and develop additional product candidates; \nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk factors\u201d section of this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\n \u00b7 our relative responsibility for developing and commercializing taNK product candidates covered by our joint development and license agreement with Sorrento Therapeutics; \nUtilization of Net Operating Loss Carryforwards (NOLs) and Research and Development Credits\n \u00b7 potentially seek regulatory approval for our product candidates; \n \u00b7 the countries in which the clinical trials are conducted; \nOur Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Soon-Shiong, founded and has a controlling interest in NantWorks, LLC (NantWorks), which is a collection of multiple companies in the healthcare and technology space. We have entered into arrangements with certain affiliates of NantWorks described below that, taken together, we expect will facilitate the development of new genetically modified NK cells for our product pipeline.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $175.9 million compared to $59.1 million as of December 31, 2014. In addition, investments in marketable securities were $173.4 million, of which $118.3 million were short-term investments as compared to no marketable securities as of December 31, 2014.\nRevenue\n \u00b7 establish a commercialization infrastructure and scale up our manufacturing and distribution capabilities to commercialize any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval; \nIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments when the Terms of an Award Provide that a Performance Target Could Be Achieved After the Requisite Service Period, or ASU 2014-12. The ASU requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. ASU 2014-12 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted. We are early adopting ASU 2015-02 for the year ended December 31, 2015. This standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe do not expect any of our product candidates to be commercially available for at least the next several years, if ever.\nWe record our available-for-sale investments at fair value. At December 31, 2015, our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities totaled $191.5 million. FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820, establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value (see Note 4 Financial Statement Details\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). Each level of input represents varying degrees of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value. Valuations using Level 1 and 2 inputs are generally based on price quotations and other observable inputs in active markets and do not require significant management judgment or estimation. We utilize a third-party pricing service to assist us in obtaining fair value pricing for these investments. While pricing for these securities is based on proprietary models, the inputs used are based on observable market information; therefore we have classified our inputs as Level 1 and Level 2.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02), which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for operating leases with lease terms greater than twelve months in the balance sheet. The update also requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on its financial statements and disclosures.\n \u00b7 potentially seek regulatory approval for our product candidates; \nOther expense increased by $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.

management's discussion and analysis report:\n\nOverview\n- NantKwest is a clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on harnessing natural killer cells to treat cancer and inflammatory diseases. \n- The company has incurred significant net losses since inception, with net losses of $236.9 million in 2015 and $6.2 million in 2014, primarily due to stock-based compensation and R&D spending.\n\nRevenue\n- Minimal revenue to date from non-exclusive license agreements related to use of the company's cell lines and IP. These agreements were spun out to Brink Biologics in June 2015.\n- No revenue from product sales yet and not expected for several more years, if ever.\n\nExpenses \n- R&D expenses were $11.4 million in 2015, increased from $1.6 million in 2014 due to more spending on lab, clinical trials, staffing, etc. Expected to continue increasing significantly.\n- SG&A expenses were $227.7 million in 2015, increased from $4.6 million in 2014, primarily due to $211.2 million in stock compensation expense. Includes costs of being a public company.\n\nCash Flows\n- Used $25.3 million in operating activities in 2015, consisting primarily of net loss adjusted for non-cash items.\n- Used $175.2 million in investing activities in 2015, largely purchases of marketable securities. \n- Provided $317.3 million from financing activities in 2015, mainly from IPO and other equity offerings. \n\nLiquidity Outlook\n- Believes it has sufficient capital from IPO proceeds and cash reserves to fund at least 24 months of operations based on current operating plan.\n\nSo in summary, high operating losses to date funding R&D pipeline, but significant cash raised recently from public markets to continue advancing development programs. Revenue not expected for several more years."}
