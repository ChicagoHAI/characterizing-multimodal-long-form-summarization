MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the \"Risk Factors\" section of this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel small molecule product candidates primarily to treat cancer. Using our proprietary chemistry platform, we have created an extensive library of targeted agents designed to work against cellular pathways important to cancer cells. We believe that the product candidates in our pipeline have the potential to be efficacious in a variety of cancers. We have one Phase 3 clinical-stage product candidate and two other clinical-stage product candidates (one of which is being developed for treatment of acute radiation syndromes) and several preclinical programs. Substantially all of our current effort is focused on our lead product candidate, rigosertib. Rigosertib is being tested in an intravenous formulation as a single agent, and an oral formulation in combination with azacitidine, in clinical trials for patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (\"MDS\").\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in December 1998 and commenced operations in January 1999. Our operations to date have included our organization and staffing, business planning, raising capital, in-licensing technology from research institutions, identifying potential product candidates, developing product candidates and building strategic alliances, as well as undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates.\nSince commencing operations, we have dedicated a significant portion of our resources to the development of our clinical-stage product candidates, particularly rigosertib. We incurred research and development expenses of $20.1 million and $25.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We anticipate that a significant portion of our operating expenses will continue to be related to research and development as we continue to advance our programs. In July 2013, we completed our initial public offering, or IPO, from which we received net proceeds of $79.8 million. Prior to the consummation of the IPO, we funded our operations primarily through the sale of preferred stock amounting to $144.7 million, the issuance of debt amounting to $26.8 million, which was later converted into shares of preferred stock, the receipt of $8.0 million from The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society under a May 2010 funding agreement, and the receipt of upfront payments of $57.5 million from Baxter (predecessor to Baxalta) and SymBio in connection with our collaboration agreements. Under the Baxalta collaboration agreement, we received payments towards costs for the INSPIRE trial of $5.0 million and $2.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Baxalta agreement was terminated on August 30, 2016 as a result of Baxalta's decision to terminate following its strategic review of priorities.\nDuring 2015 we sold 376,192 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $7.5 million. In January 2016, we completed a sale of common stock and warrants for net proceeds of approximately $1.6 million. In July 2016, we completed a rights offering of units of common stock and warrants for net proceeds of $15.8 million. In December 2016, we entered into a sales agreement with FBR Capital Markets & Co. (\"FBR\") to create an at-the-market equity program under which we from time to time\nmay offer and sell shares of common stock through FBR. There were no sales of common stock under this program during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOur net losses were $19.7 million and $24.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $338.2 million. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates, even if milestones under our license and collaboration agreements may be met.\nDuring 2016, we took significant actions to conserve cash, including reduction in personnel and expenditures. While we will continue to take cash conservation actions where appropriate, our net expenditures will increase in 2017, due to the termination of cost-sharing payments from Baxalta and as more INSPIRE sites open and more patients enroll in the INSPIRE trial. As of December 31, 2016, we had $21.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund our ongoing trials and operations into the fourth quarter of 2017, although there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. See \"-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Operating and Capital Expenditure Requirements.\"\nFinancial Overview\nRevenue\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our revenues were derived exclusively from activities conducted in accordance with our collaboration arrangements with Baxalta and SymBio, as well as recognition of revenue from our May 2010 funding agreement with The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, or LLS. The following table sets forth a summary of revenue recognized during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 8: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> LLS\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>8,000,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Baxalta\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,999,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,893,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SymBio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>547,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>563,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>5,546,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>11,456,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn May 2010, we entered into a funding agreement with LLS to fund our ONTIME trial and certain related activities. We received $8.0 million under the LLS funding agreement, as amended, and terminated the funding agreement effective March 2013. As a result of the potential obligation to repay LLS, we initially recorded the funding received as deferred revenue. During the fourth quarter of 2015, however, we determined, based in part on the commencement of the INSPIRE trial, that the research program covered by the LLS funding agreement was unsuccessful and, as a result, the funding received non-repayable. Accordingly, we recognized $8.0 million of deferred revenue during the quarter ended December 31, 2015.\nWe have not generated any revenue from commercial product sales. In the future, if any of our product candidates currently under development are approved for commercial sale in the United States or other territories where we have retained commercialization rights, we may generate revenue from product sales, or alternatively, we may choose to select a collaborator to commercialize our product candidates in these markets.\nThe Baxalta collaboration agreement was considered to be a multiple-element arrangement for accounting purposes. We determined that there were two deliverables under the Baxalta agreement; specifically, the license to rigosertib for Europe and the related research and development services that\nwe were obligated to provide. We concluded that $42.4 million of the fixed and determinable $50.0 million upfront payment was associated with the license and $7.6 million was associated with the research and development services. We recognized the entire $42.4 million associated with the upfront license as revenue during the third quarter of 2012 upon the execution of the Baxalta agreement, and we recognized the research and development services revenue of $7.6 million on the proportional performance method over the period of commitment and development, which was estimated to be through March 31, 2014, the period of our non-contingent obligations to perform research and development services sufficient to advance rigosertib. In accordance with the agreement, we elected to have Baxalta fund fifty percent of the costs of the INSPIRE trial, up to $15.0 million. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $5.0 million and $2.9 million, respectively, of research and development services revenue related to Baxalta's funding of the INSPIRE trial. On March 3, 2016, we received notification of Baxalta's election to terminate the development and license agreement based on a strategic reprioritization review, effective August 30, 2016, at which time, the rights licensed to Baxalta reverted to us at no cost. Additionally, any rights we had to funding, pre-commercial milestone payments and royalties from Baxalta terminated in accordance with the agreement.\nThe SymBio collaboration agreement is also considered to be a multiple-element arrangement for accounting purposes. We determined that there were three deliverables under the SymBio collaboration agreement; specifically, the license to rigosertib for Japan and Korea, our obligation to perform research and development services necessary for SymBio to seek approval in its territory and our obligation to participate on a joint steering committee. We concluded that these deliverables should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting. We determined that the $7.5 million upfront payment received in 2011 should be deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis through December 2027, reflecting our estimate of when we will complete our obligations under the agreement. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized revenues of $455,000 and $455,000, respectively, under the SymBio collaboration agreement. In addition, we recognized revenues of $92,000 and $108,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the supply agreement with SymBio.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 9: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>9,178,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>9,533,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,071,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,895,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>29,249,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>35,428,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for executive and other administrative personnel, including stock-based compensation and travel expenses. Other general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs, communication expenses, insurance, board of directors expenses and professional fees for legal, patent review, consulting and accounting services.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will remain constant in the short-term, but would increase in the future with the continued research and development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. These increases will likely include increased costs for insurance, costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and payments to outside consultants\namong other expenses. Additionally, if and when we believe a regulatory approval of a product candidate appears likely, we anticipate an increase in payroll and expense as a result of our preparation for commercial operations, especially as it relates to the sales and marketing of our product candidates.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include:\n\u2022 employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense;\n\u2022 expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials and preclinical studies;\n\u2022 the cost of acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical trial materials;\n\u2022 direct expenses for maintenance of research equipment, clinical trial insurance and other supplies; and\n\u2022 costs associated with preclinical activities and regulatory operations.\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. License fees and milestone payments we make related to in-licensed products and technology are expensed if it is determined that they have no alternative future use. We record costs for some development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in the short-term as the number of sites and enrolled patients related to our INSPIRE clinical trial increases.\nTo date, our research and development expenses have related primarily to the development of rigosertib. We do not currently utilize a formal time allocation system to capture expenses on a project-by-project basis because we are organized and record expense by functional department and our employees may allocate time to more than one development project. Accordingly, we do not allocate expenses to individual projects or product candidates, although we do allocate some portion of our research and development expenses by functional area and by compound.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses by functional area for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 10: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pre-clinical & clinical development\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>8,513,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>12,200,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel related\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,149,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,988,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Manufacturing, formulation & development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,490,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,838,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,042,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,850,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consulting fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,877,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,019,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>20,071,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>25,895,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIt is difficult to determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of our current or future preclinical programs and clinical trials of our product candidates, or if, when or to what extent\nwe will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including the uncertainties of future clinical and preclinical studies, uncertainties in clinical trial enrollment rate and significant and changing government regulation. In addition, the probability of success for each product candidate will depend on numerous factors, including competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. We will determine which programs to pursue and how much to fund each program in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate, an assessment of each product candidate's commercial potential and our available funds.\nInterest Expense and Other Income, Net\nOther income, net consists principally of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalent balances and foreign exchange gains and losses.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nThis management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses, revenue recognition, deferred revenue and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue primarily through collaborative research and license agreements. The terms of these agreements contain multiple deliverables, which may include licenses, research and development activities, participation in joint steering committees and product supply. The terms of these agreements may include nonrefundable upfront license fees, payments for research and development activities, payments based upon the achievement of specified milestones, royalty payments based on product sales derived from the collaboration, and payments for supplying product. In all instances, we recognize revenue only when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered, collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have fulfilled our performance obligations under the contract.\nEffective January 1, 2011, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements , or ASU 2009-13. This guidance, which applies to multiple-element arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after January 1, 2011, amends the criteria for separating and allocating consideration in a multiple-element arrangement by modifying the fair value requirements for revenue recognition and\neliminating the use of the residual value method. The selling prices of deliverables under an arrangement may be derived using third-party evidence, or TPE, or a best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value, or VSOE, is not available. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the element within the license agreement was sold on a standalone basis. Establishing BESP involves management's judgment and takes into account multiple factors, including market conditions and company-specific factors, such as those factors contemplated in negotiating the agreements as well as internally developed models that include assumptions related to market opportunity, discounted cash flows, estimated development costs, probability of success, and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the license. In validating the BESP, management considers whether changes in key assumptions used to determine the BESP will have a significant effect on the allocation of the arrangement consideration between the multiple deliverables. We may use third-party valuation specialists to assist us in determining BESP. Deliverables under the arrangement are separate units of accounting if (i) the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and (ii) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially within our control. The arrangement consideration that is fixed or determinable at the inception of the arrangement is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling prices. The appropriate revenue recognition model is applied to each element and revenue is accordingly recognized as each element is delivered. Management exercises significant judgment in determining whether a deliverable is a separate unit of accounting.\nIn determining the separate units of accounting, we evaluate whether the license has standalone value to the collaborator based on consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances for each arrangement. Factors considered in this determination include the research and development capabilities of the collaborator and the availability of relevant research expertise in the marketplace. In addition, we consider whether or not (i) the collaborator can use the license for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining deliverables, (ii) the value of the license is dependent on the undelivered items and (iii) the collaborator or other vendors can provide the undelivered items.\nUnder a collaborative research and license agreement, a steering committee is typically responsible for overseeing the general working relationships, determining the protocols to be followed in the research and development performed, and evaluating the results from the continued development of the product. We evaluate whether our participation in joint steering committees is a substantive obligation or whether the services are considered inconsequential or perfunctory. The factors we consider in determining if our participation in a joint steering committee is a substantive obligation include: (i) which party negotiated or requested the steering committee, (ii) how frequently the steering committee meets, (iii) whether or not there are any penalties or other recourse if we do not attend the steering committee meetings, (iv) which party has decision making authority on the steering committee and (v) whether or not the collaborator has the requisite experience and expertise associated with the research and development of the licensed intellectual property.\nFor all periods presented, whenever we determine that an element is delivered over a period of time, we recognize revenue using either a proportional performance model or a straight-line model over the period of performance, which is typically the research and development term. We typically use progress achieved under our various CRO contracts as the measure of performance. At each reporting period, we reassess our cumulative measure of performance and make appropriate adjustments, if necessary. We recognize revenue using the proportional performance model whenever we can make reasonably reliable estimates of the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement. We recognize revenue under the proportional performance model at each reporting period by multiplying the total expected payments under the contract, excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of milestones, by the ratio of the level of effort incurred to date to the estimated total level of effort required to complete the performance obligations under the\narrangement. Revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned, as determined using the proportional performance model as of each reporting period. Alternatively, if we cannot make reasonably reliable estimates of the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement on a straight-line basis over the period expected to complete our performance obligations.\nIncentive milestone payments may be triggered either by the results of our research efforts or by events external to us, such as regulatory approval to market a product. We recognize consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a milestone in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved, but only if the consideration earned from the achievement of a milestone meets all the criteria for the milestone to be considered substantive at the inception of the arrangement. For a milestone to be considered substantive, the consideration earned by achieving the milestone must be commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the item delivered as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone, relate solely to our past performance and be reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the collaboration agreement.\nFor events for which the occurrences are contingent solely upon the passage of time or are the result of performance by a third party, we will recognize the contingent payments as revenue when payments are earned, the amounts are fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.\nWe will recognize royalty revenue, if any, as earned in accordance with the contract terms when third-party sales can be reliably measured and collectability is reasonably assured.\nWe recognized revenue of $5.0 million and $2.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, under our license and collaboration agreement with Baxalta. We recognized revenue of $0.5 million and $0.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, under our license and collaboration agreement with SymBio. We recognized revenue of $0 million and $8.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, under our funding agreement with LLS. The Baxalta and SymBio agreements are the only agreements that are being accounted for under ASU 2009-13.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and include, but are not limited to, license fees related to the acquisition of in-licensed products, employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and travel, expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and investigative sites that conduct clinical trials and preclinical studies, the cost of acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical trial materials, facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other supplies and costs associated with preclinical activities and regulatory operations.\nWe record costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials, based on our evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations, or information provided to us by our vendors on their actual costs incurred. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual arrangements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expense, as the case may be.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recorded deferred tax assets of $157.8 million as of December 31, 2016, which have been fully offset by a valuation allowance due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to realize these tax benefits.\nThe deferred tax assets are primarily composed of federal and state tax net operating loss (\"NOL\"), carry forwards and research and development tax credit carry forwards. As of December 31, 2016, we had federal NOL carry forwards of $193.1 million, state NOL carry forwards of $154.4 million, and research and development tax credit carry forwards of $71.7 million available to reduce future taxable income, if any. These federal NOL carry forwards will begin to expire at various dates starting in 2022. The state NOL carry forwards will begin to expire at various dates starting in 2025. In general, if we experience a greater than 50 percentage point aggregate change in ownership of specified significant stockholders over a three-year period, utilization of our pre-change NOL carry forwards will be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\") and similar state laws. Such limitations may result in expiration of a portion of the NOL carry forwards before utilization and may be substantial. We have determined that we have experienced ownership changes in the past and approximately $24.0 million of our NOL carry forwards are subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 of the Code. If we experienced a Section 382 ownership change in connection with the offering or as a result of future changes in our stock ownership, some of which changes are outside our control, the tax benefits related to the NOL carry forwards may be further limited or lost.\nStock-Based Compensation\nPrior to April 2013, our stock option awards were accounted for as liability awards as we, through our chairman of the board of directors, who is also a significant stockholder, had established a pattern of settling these awards for cash. Accordingly, we measured stock-based compensation expense at the end of each reporting period based on the intrinsic value of all outstanding vested stock options on each reporting date and recognized expense based on any increases in their intrinsic value since the last measurement date to the extent the stock options vested. The intrinsic value represented the difference between the current fair value of our common stock and the contractual exercise prices of the awards.\nOn April 23, 2013, we distributed a notification letter to all holders of stock options under our 2007 Equity Compensation Plan advising them that cash settlement transactions would no longer occur, unless, at the time of a cash settlement transaction, the option holder has held the common stock issued upon exercise of options for a period of greater than six months prior to such cash settlement transaction and that any such settlement would be at the fair value of the common stock on the date of such sale. Following this notification, we reclassified options outstanding under our 2007 Equity Compensation Plan from liabilities to stockholders' deficit within our consolidated balance sheets. Upon issuing the notification, a modification to the liability awards occurred and the awards are now accounted for as equity awards from the date of modification with compensation expense fixed at fair value at the modification date. As a result, we reclassified the amount of stock-based compensation liability at the modification date to additional paid-in capital. The modification date fair value is recognized over the remaining service period, generally the vesting period, on a straight-line basis. The fair value of the modified awards was estimated on the modification date using the intrinsic value model. The grant date fair value of awards granted after the modification is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model, net of estimated forfeitures. Awards granted to non-employees will also be valued using the Black-Scholes valuation model and will be subject to periodic adjustment until the underlying equity instruments vest.\nWe record stock-based compensation expense as a component of research and development expenses or general and administrative expenses, depending on the function performed by the optionee. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we allocated stock-based compensation as follows:\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,887,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,936,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,042,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,850,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>3,929,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>3,786,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFair Value Estimates\nSince April 23, 2013, we estimate the fair value of share-based awards to employees and directors using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes model requires the input of highly complex and subjective assumptions, including (a) the expected stock price volatility, (b) the calculation of the expected term of the award, (c) the risk free interest rate and (d) expected dividends. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock since its IPO in July 2013. We estimate the expected life of our employee stock options using the \"simplified\" method, whereby, the expected life equals the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected life of the option are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect during the period the options were granted. We have never paid, and do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWarrants\nCommon stock warrants are accounted for in accordance with applicable accounting guidance provided in ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (ASC Topic 815), as either derivative liabilities or as equity instruments depending on the specific terms of the warrant agreement. Some of our warrants are classified as liabilities because in certain circumstances they could require cash settlement. We estimate the fair value of warrants accounted for as liabilities using the Black-Scholes pricing model.\nWarrants outstanding and warrant activity for the year ended December 31, 2016 is as

<td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nClinical Trial Expense\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. Our clinical trial accrual process is designed to account for expenses resulting from our obligations under contracts with vendors, consultants and CROs and clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations, which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided to us under such contracts. Our objective is to reflect the appropriate clinical trial expenses in our consolidated financial statements by matching the appropriate expenses with the period in which services are provided and efforts are\nexpended. We account for these expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured by patient progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial. We determine accrual estimates through financial models that take into account discussion with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of completion of trials, or the services completed. During the course of a clinical trial, we adjust our clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on the facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Our clinical trial accrual and prepaid assets are dependent, in part, upon the receipt of timely and accurate reporting from CROs and other third-party vendors. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low for any particular period.\nJOBS Act\nIn April 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an \"emerging growth company\" can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an \"emerging growth company\" can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other companies.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>5,546,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>11,456,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(5,910,000 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,178,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,533,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>355,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,071,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,895,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,824,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,249,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,428,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,179,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23,703,000 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(23,972,000 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>269,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in fair value of warrant liability\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,988,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,988,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35,000 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>97,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19,653,000 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(24,007,000 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>4,354,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(19,667,000 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(24,023,000 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>4,356,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nRevenues decreased by $5.9 million, or 52%, in 2016 when compared to 2015 primarily as a result of recognizing $8.0 million of deferred revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015 from our May 2010 funding agreement with LLS. The decrease was partially offset by $2.1 million more contractual cost-sharing revenue from Baxalta for a portion of the costs of the INSPIRE trial in 2016 compared to the 2015 period.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $0.4 million, or 3.7%, to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily caused by a decrease in professional fees and consulting fees of $0.5 million as we continued to focus on reducing non-core costs. The decrease was also caused by a $0.2 million decrease in facilities and related costs resulting from a reduction in general and administrative headcount to 8 at December 31, 2016 from 12 at December 31, 2015. Salaries and benefits for continuing employees was $0.5 million lower in the 2016 period, but that decrease was offset by $0.2 million greater of severance expense and $0.5 million higher bonuses paid to employees in the 2016 period. Investor relations and meetings expenses were $0.2 million higher in the 2016 period as the company attended and presented at more conferences.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses decreased by $5.8 million, or 22.5%, to $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was caused primarily by a $3.7 million decrease in pre-clinical and clinical development costs in the 2016 period, as we focused our development efforts on the INSPIRE trial and worked to reduce expenses related to other programs or legacy studies. The clinical and preclinical decrease was comprised of a reduction of $3.7 million in expense in the 2016 period for the higher-risk MDS studies which preceded INSPIRE, offset by a $4.9 million increase in clinical expense related to INSPIRE. The clinical and preclinical decrease was also attributable to a decrease of $1.5 million in expense related to lower risk MDS studies in 2016, a decrease of $1.2 million in preclinical and sponsored research in 2016, and decrease of $2.2 million in expense related to our oral combination program, legacy studies, and other clinical costs during 2016. The decrease in research and development expenses in 2016 was also caused by a reduction of $0.5 million in API manufacturing costs and a reduction of $0.8 million in drug product manufacturing costs. Personnel and related costs were $0.8 million lower as research and development headcount was reduced to 15 at December 31, 2016 from 23 at December 31, 2015.\nChange in fair value of warrant liability\nThe fair value of the warrant liability, which relates to warrants issued in January and July 2016, decreased $4.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to no change during the year ended December 31, 2015, which resulted in a commensurate increase in other income during the 2016 period. The decrease in the fair value of the warrant liability in 2016 was primarily due to the revaluation of the warrants outstanding. At December 31, 2016, warrants outstanding entitled the holders to purchase up to 3,288,864 shares of our common stock. These warrants expire in July 2021.\nOther income, net\nOther income (expense), net, was $62,000 of other income for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $35,000 of other expense for the year ended December 31, 2015. This change of $97,000 was due primarily to a foreign exchange gain of $1,000 in the 2016 period compared to a foreign exchange loss of $43,000 in the 2015 period, a $38,000 increase in interest income as a result of higher rates of return on cash equivalents during 2016, and the loss on the disposal of office equipment of $15,000 in the 2015 period.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have incurred net losses and generally negative cash flows from our operations. We incurred net losses of $19.7 million and $24.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Since inception our accumulated deficit is $338.2 million. We believe that\nour cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our ongoing trials and operations into the fourth quarter of 2017. Due to our ongoing operating losses and our accumulated deficit, in combination with the fact that the future success of the Company is dependent on its ability to obtain additional financing, the opinion of our independent registered public accounting firm on our audited consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 contains an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(15,813,000 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(31,238,000 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,423,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,464,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of foreign currency translation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,000 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,000 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,601,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(23,783,000 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash used in operating activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and consisted primarily of a net loss of $19.7 million, and a change in the fair value of warrant liability of $4.0 million, partially offset by $3.9 million of noncash stock-based compensation expense and $0.1 million of depreciation and amortization expense. Changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net increase in cash of $3.8 million. Significant changes in operating assets and liabilities included a decrease of $1.5 million in receivables, primarily due collection of amounts due to us related to our collaboration with Baxalta. Accrued expenses increased $0.7 million due to higher accrued clinical costs and bonus, and the timing of invoices for clinical trial and manufacturing development costs related to the ongoing trials at December 31, 2016. Accounts payable increased $1.9 million due to the timing of payments to our vendors. Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased $0.2 million as a result of the recognition of expense for clinical and manufacturing activities, as well as insurance expense. Deferred revenue decreased $0.5 million related to the recognition of revenue on the up-front payment under our collaboration agreement with SymBio.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $31.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and consisted primarily of a net loss of $24.1 million, partially offset by recognition of deferred revenue of $8.0 million related to LLS and $0.5 million related to our SymBio collaboration agreement, as well as $3.8 million of noncash stock-based compensation expense and $0.2 million of depreciation and amortization expense. Changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net decrease in cash of $2.6 million. Significant changes in operating assets and liabilities included an increase of $1.4 million in receivables, primarily due to our collaboration with Baxalta. Accrued expenses decreased $1.9 million due to lower accrued clinical costs and bonus, and the timing of invoices for clinical trial and manufacturing development costs related to the ongoing trials at December 31, 2015. Accounts payable decreased $0.6 million due to the timing of payments to our vendors. Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased $1.2 million as a result of the recognition of expense for clinical and manufacturing activities, as well as insurance expense. Restricted cash decreased $0.1 million due to the expiration of a letter of credit related to an office lease which was terminated during the first quarter of 2015.\nNet cash provided by investing activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $0.\nNet cash provided by financing activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was due to proceeds from the sales of our common stock in our January 2016 offering and our July 2016 rights offering. In December 2016, we entered into a sales agreement with FBR to create an at-the-market equity program under which we from time to time may offer and sell shares of common stock through FBR. There were no sales of common stock under this program during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was due to proceeds from the sales of our common stock.\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nWe have not achieved profitability since our inception and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. We expect net cash expended in 2017 to increase from 2016, due to the cessation of the cost-sharing payments from Baxalta and an increase in expenditures related to our INSPIRE trial, partially offset by savings from a workforce reduction. During 2016 we received $5.0 million in cost-sharing payments under our agreement with Baxalta which was terminated as of August 31, 2016. We expect expenditures related to our INSPIRE trial to increase in 2017 as clinical trial sites and patients are added. During 2016, we implemented workforce reductions of 12 employees which represents approximately 34 percent of our workforce. Affected employees were offered severance pay in accordance with our policy or, if applicable, their employment agreements. As a result of the workforce reduction, we recorded, severance-related charges totaling approximately $3.0 million, which included a non-cash charge of approximately $1.4 million related to the accelerated vesting of the outstanding stock options for certain of the affected employees. Savings from the workforce reduction should be fully realized during 2017. We may also incur other charges or cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of, or associated with, the workforce reduction.\nWhile we will continue to take cash conservation actions where appropriate, our net expenditures will increase in 2017, due to the termination of cost-sharing payments from Baxalta, the openings of more INSPIRE sites and more patients enrollments in the INSPIRE trial. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our ongoing trials and operations into the fourth quarter of 2017. However, due to our ongoing losses and our accumulated deficit in combination with these factors, the opinion of our independent registered public accounting firm on our audited consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 contains an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe are exploring various sources of funding for continued development of rigosertib in MDS and AML, as well as our ongoing operations. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates, even if milestones under our license and collaboration agreements may be met. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses. We do not currently have an organization for the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. We may rely on licensing and co-promotion agreements with strategic or collaborative partners for the commercialization of our products in the United States and other territories. If we choose to build a commercial infrastructure to support marketing in the United States for any of our product candidates that achieve regulatory approval, such commercial infrastructure could be expected to include a targeted, oncology sales force supported by\nsales management, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure internally, we would have to invest financial and management resources, some of which would have to be deployed prior to having any certainty about marketing approval. Furthermore, we have and expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nWe do not have the funding resources necessary to carry out all of our proposed operating activities. We will need to obtain additional financing in the future in order to fully fund our INSPIRE trial and to further develop rigosertib or any other product candidates through the regulatory approval process. Accordingly, we may delay our ongoing clinical trials, including the INSPIRE trial, until we secure adequate additional funding. We may explore various dilutive and non-dilutive sources of funding, including equity and debt financings, strategic alliances, business development and other sources. If we raise additional funds through strategic collaborations and alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, which may including existing collaboration partners, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates, including rigosertib, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are unable to secure adequate additional funding, we will continue to delay, scale-back or eliminate certain of our planned research, drug discovery and development activities and certain other aspects of our operations and our business until such time as we are successful in securing adequate additional funding. As a result, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected. We will incur substantial costs beyond the present and planned clinical trials in order to file an NDA for rigosertib. The nature, design, size and cost of further studies, if required, will depend in large part on the outcome of preceding studies and discussions with regulators.\nPlease see \"Risk Factors\" for additional risks associated with our substantial capital requirements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by applicable SEC regulations.\nSegment Reporting\nWe view our operations and manage our business in one segment, which is the identification and development of oncology therapeutics.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance permits the use of either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of the guidance to interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the impact of the amended guidance on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and related disclosures.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties in the financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. An entity must provide certain disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. The guidance applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim\nperiods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. We adopted the new guidance as of December 31, 2016. Based on our current cash position and an evaluation of our expected future net cash outflows we have determined there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued guidance which supersedes much of the current guidance for leases. The new standard requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on their balance sheets for all the leases with terms greater than twelve months. Based on certain criteria, leases will be classified as either financing or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. For leases with a term of twelve months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. If a lessee makes this election, it should recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The modified retrospective approach includes a number of optional practical expedients primarily focused on leases that commenced before the effective date of the new guidance, including continuing to account for leases that commence before the effective date in accordance with previous guidance, unless the lease is modified. We are evaluating the impact of the adoption of the standard on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in the revenue recognition standard issued in May 2014. The new standard clarifies how an entity should identify the unit of accounting (i.e. the specified good or service) for the principal versus agent evaluation and how it should apply the control principle to certain types of arrangements. The effective date and transition requirements are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in the May 2014 revenue standard (Accounting Standards Codification 606). We are currently assessing the adoption methodology and the impact the adoption of these ASUs will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and related disclosures.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued guidance that addresses the income tax effects of stock-based payments and eliminates the windfall pool concept, as all of the tax effects related to stock-based payments will now be recorded at settlement (or expiration) through the income statement. The new guidance also permits entities to make an accounting policy election for the impact of forfeitures on the recognition of expense for stock-based payment awards. Forfeitures can be estimated or recognized when they occur. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period, with any adjustment reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We are currently evaluating the effect this standard may have on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued guidance requiring that amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning in 2018 and should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect of the standard on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.", "item_7_truncated": "Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nTable 8: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> LLS\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>8,000,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Baxalta\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,999,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,893,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SymBio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>547,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>563,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>5,546,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>11,456,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our revenues were derived exclusively from activities conducted in accordance with our collaboration arrangements with Baxalta and SymBio, as well as recognition of revenue from our May 2010 funding agreement with The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, or LLS. The following table sets forth a summary of revenue recognized during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\u2022 expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials and preclinical studies;\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel small molecule product candidates primarily to treat cancer. Using our proprietary chemistry platform, we have created an extensive library of targeted agents designed to work against cellular pathways important to cancer cells. We believe that the product candidates in our pipeline have the potential to be efficacious in a variety of cancers. We have one Phase 3 clinical-stage product candidate and two other clinical-stage product candidates (one of which is being developed for treatment of acute radiation syndromes) and several preclinical programs. Substantially all of our current effort is focused on our lead product candidate, rigosertib. Rigosertib is being tested in an intravenous formulation as a single agent, and an oral formulation in combination with azacitidine, in clinical trials for patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (\"MDS\").\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in December 1998 and commenced operations in January 1999. Our operations to date have included our organization and staffing, business planning, raising capital, in-licensing technology from research institutions, identifying potential product candidates, developing product candidates and building strategic alliances, as well as undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates.\nWe record costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials, based on our evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations, or information provided to us by our vendors on their actual costs incurred. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual arrangements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expense, as the case may be.\n\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(15,813,000 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(31,238,000 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,423,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,464,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of foreign currency translation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,000 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,000 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,601,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(23,783,000 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in the short-term as the number of sites and enrolled patients related to our INSPIRE clinical trial increases.\nTable 9: <table> <tr> <td>

Changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net decrease in cash of $2.6 million. Significant changes in operating assets and liabilities included an increase of $1.4 million in receivables, primarily due to our collaboration with Baxalta. Accrued expenses decreased $1.9 million due to lower accrued clinical costs and bonus, and the timing of invoices for clinical trial and manufacturing development costs related to the ongoing trials at December 31, 2015. Accounts payable decreased $0.6 million due to the timing of payments to our vendors. Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased $1.2 million as a result of the recognition of expense for clinical and manufacturing activities, as well as insurance expense. Restricted cash decreased $0.1 million due to the expiration of a letter of credit related to an office lease which was terminated during the first quarter of 2015.\nThe fair value of the warrant liability, which relates to warrants issued in January and July 2016, decreased $4.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to no change during the year ended December 31, 2015, which resulted in a commensurate increase in other income during the 2016 period. The decrease in the fair value of the warrant liability in 2016 was primarily due to the revaluation of the warrants outstanding.

We incurred research and development expenses of $20.1 million and $25.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We anticipate that a significant portion of our operating expenses will continue to be related to research and development as we continue to advance our programs. In July 2013, we completed our initial public offering, or IPO, from which we received net proceeds of $79.8 million. Prior to the consummation of the IPO, we funded our operations primarily through the sale of preferred stock amounting to $144.7 million, the issuance of debt amounting to $26.8 million, which was later converted into shares of preferred stock, the receipt of $8.0 million from The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society under a May 2010 funding agreement, and the receipt of upfront payments of $57.5 million from Baxter (predecessor to Baxalta) and SymBio in connection with our collaboration agreements. Under the Baxalta collaboration agreement, we received payments towards costs for the INSPIRE trial of $5.0 million and $2.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Baxalta agreement was terminated on August 30, 2016 as a result of Baxalta's decision to terminate following its strategic review of priorities.\nRevenue\nWe record stock-based compensation expense as a component of research and development expenses or general and administrative expenses, depending on the function performed by the optionee. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we allocated stock-based compensation as follows:\nIn determining the separate units of accounting, we evaluate whether the license has standalone value to the collaborator based on consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances for each arrangement. Factors considered in this determination include the research and development capabilities of the collaborator and the availability of relevant research expertise in the marketplace. In addition, we consider whether or not (i) the collaborator can use the license for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining deliverables, (ii) the value of the license is dependent on the undelivered items and (iii) the collaborator or other vendors can provide the undelivered items.\nWarrants outstanding and warrant activity for the year ended December 31, 2016 is as follows:\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued guidance which supersedes much of the current guidance for leases. The new standard requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on their balance sheets for all the leases with terms greater than twelve months. Based on certain criteria, leases will be classified as either financing or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. For leases with a term of twelve months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. If a lessee makes this election, it should recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The modified retrospective approach includes a number of optional practical expedients primarily focused on leases that commenced before the effective date of the new guidance, including continuing to account for leases that commence before the effective date in accordance with previous guidance, unless the lease is modified. We are evaluating the impact of the adoption of the standard on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n\nJOBS Act\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the \"Risk Factors\" section of this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nRevenues decreased by $5.9 million, or 52%, in 2016 when compared to 2015 primarily as a result of recognizing $8.0 million of deferred revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015 from our May 2010 funding agreement with LLS. The decrease was partially offset by $2.1 million more contractual cost-sharing revenue from Baxalta for a portion of the costs of the INSPIRE trial in 2016 compared to the 2015 period.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nmay offer and sell shares of common stock through FBR. There were no sales of common stock under this program during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThis management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses, revenue recognition, deferred revenue and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nCommon stock warrants are accounted for in accordance with applicable accounting guidance provided in ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (ASC Topic 815), as either derivative liabilities or as equity instruments depending on the specific terms of the warrant agreement. Some of our warrants are classified as liabilities because in certain circumstances they could require cash settlement. We estimate the fair value of warrants accounted for as liabilities using the Black-Scholes pricing model.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued guidance requiring that amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning in 2018 and should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect of the standard on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. License fees and milestone payments we make related to in-licensed products and technology are expensed if it is determined that they have no alternative future use. We record costs for some development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors.\nStock-Based Compensation\nOverview\nWe have not achieved profitability since our inception and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. We expect net cash expended in 2017 to increase from 2016, due to the cessation of the cost-sharing payments from Baxalta and an increase in expenditures related to our INSPIRE trial, partially offset by savings from a workforce reduction. During 2016 we received $5.0 million in cost-sharing payments under our agreement with Baxalta which was terminated as of August 31, 2016. We expect expenditures related to our INSPIRE trial to increase in 2017 as clinical trial sites and patients are added. During 2016, we implemented workforce reductions of 12 employees which represents approximately 34 percent of our workforce. Affected employees were offered severance pay in accordance with our policy or, if applicable, their employment agreements. As a result of the workforce reduction, we recorded, severance-related charges totaling approximately $3.0 million, which included a non-cash charge of approximately $1.4 million related to the accelerated vesting of the outstanding stock options for certain of the affected employees. Savings from the workforce reduction should be fully realized during 2017. We may also incur other charges or cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of, or associated with, the workforce reduction.\nOther income, net consists principally of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalent balances and foreign exchange gains and losses.\n\nFinancial Overview\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\n\u2022 employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense;\nThe following table summarizes our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nThe deferred tax assets are primarily composed of federal and state tax net operating loss (\"NOL\"), carry forwards and research and development tax credit carry forwards. As of December 31, 2016, we had federal NOL carry forwards of $193.1 million, state NOL carry forwards of $154.4 million, and research and development tax credit carry forwards of $71.7 million available to reduce future taxable income, if any. These federal NOL carry forwards will begin to expire at various dates starting in 2022. The state NOL carry forwards will begin to expire at various dates starting in 2025. In general, if we experience a greater than 50 percentage point aggregate change in ownership of specified significant stockholders over a three-year period, utilization of our pre-change NOL carry forwards will be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\") and similar state laws. Such limitations may result in expiration of a portion of the NOL carry forwards before utilization and may be substantial. We have determined that we have experienced ownership changes in the past and approximately $24.0 million of our NOL carry forwards are subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 of the Code. If we experienced a Section 382 ownership change in connection with the offering or as a result of future changes in our stock ownership, some of which changes are outside our control, the tax benefits related to the NOL carry forwards may be further limited or lost.\nChange in fair value of warrant liability\nNet cash used in operating activities was $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and consisted primarily of a net loss of $19.7 million, and a change in the fair value of warrant liability of $4.0 million, partially offset by $3.9 million of noncash stock-based compensation expense and $0.1 million of depreciation and amortization expense. Changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net increase in cash of $3.8 million. Significant changes in operating assets and liabilities included a decrease of $1.5 million in receivables, primarily due collection of amounts due to us related to our collaboration with Baxalta. Accrued expenses increased $0.7 million due to higher accrued clinical costs and bonus, and the timing of invoices for clinical trial and manufacturing development costs related to the ongoing trials at December 31, 2016. Accounts payable increased $1.9 million due to the timing of payments to our vendors. Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased $0.2 million as a result of the recognition of expense for clinical and manufacturing activities, as well as insurance expense. Deferred revenue decreased $0.5 million related to the recognition of revenue on the up-front payment under our collaboration agreement with SymBio.\nWe do not have the funding resources necessary to carry out all of our proposed operating activities. We will need to obtain additional financing in the future in order to fully fund our INSPIRE trial and to further develop rigosertib or any other product candidates through the regulatory approval process. Accordingly, we may delay our ongoing clinical trials, including the INSPIRE trial, until we secure adequate additional funding. We may explore various dilutive and non-dilutive sources of funding, including equity and debt financings, strategic alliances, business development and other sources. If we raise additional funds through strategic collaborations and alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, which may including existing collaboration partners, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates, including rigosertib, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are unable to secure adequate additional funding, we will continue to delay, scale-back or eliminate certain of our planned research, drug discovery and development activities and certain other aspects of our operations and our business until such time as we are successful in securing adequate additional funding. As a result, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected. We will incur substantial costs beyond the present and planned clinical trials in order to file an NDA for rigosertib. The nature, design, size and cost of further studies, if required, will depend in large part on the outcome of preceding studies and discussions with regulators.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur net losses were $19.7 million and $24.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $338.2 million. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates, even if milestones under our license and collaboration agreements may be met.\nResearch and development expenses\nDuring 2016, we took significant actions to conserve cash, including reduction in personnel and expenditures. While we will continue to take cash conservation actions where appropriate, our net expenditures will increase in 2017, due to the termination of cost-sharing payments from Baxalta and as more INSPIRE sites open and more patients enroll in the INSPIRE trial. As of December 31, 2016, we had $21.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund our ongoing trials and operations into the fourth quarter of 2017, although there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. See \"-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Operating and Capital Expenditure Requirements.\"\nWhile we will continue to take cash conservation actions where appropriate, our net expenditures will increase in 2017, due to the termination of cost-sharing payments from Baxalta, the openings of more INSPIRE sites and more patients enrollments in the INSPIRE trial. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our ongoing trials and operations into the fourth quarter of 2017. However, due to our ongoing losses and our accumulated deficit in combination with these factors, the opinion of our independent registered public accounting firm on our audited consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 contains an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nexpended. We account for these expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured by patient progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial. We determine accrual estimates through financial models that take into account discussion with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of completion of trials, or the services completed. During the course of a clinical trial, we adjust our clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on the facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Our clinical trial accrual and prepaid assets are dependent, in part, upon the receipt of timely and accurate reporting from CROs and other third-party vendors. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low for any particular period.\nEffective January 1, 2011, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements , or ASU 2009-13. This guidance, which applies to multiple-element arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after January 1, 2011, amends the criteria for separating and allocating consideration in a multiple-element arrangement by modifying the fair value requirements for revenue recognition and\n\u2022 direct expenses for maintenance of research equipment, clinical trial insurance and other supplies; and\nNet cash provided by investing activities\nNet cash used in operating activities\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the fair value of our warrant liability for the year ended December 31, 2016:\nResearch and Development Expenses\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance permits the use of either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of the guidance to interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the impact of the amended guidance on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and related disclosures.\nWe are exploring various sources of funding for continued development of rigosertib in MDS and AML, as well as our ongoing operations. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates, even if milestones under our license and collaboration agreements may be met. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses. We do not currently have an organization for the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. We may rely on licensing and co-promotion agreements with strategic or collaborative partners for the commercialization of our products in the United States and other territories. If we choose to build a commercial infrastructure to support marketing in the United States for any of our product candidates that achieve regulatory approval, such commercial infrastructure could be expected to include a targeted, oncology sales force supported by\nDuring 2015 we sold 376,192 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $7.5 million. In January 2016, we completed a sale of common stock and warrants for net proceeds of approximately $1.6 million. In July 2016, we completed a rights offering of units of common stock and warrants for net proceeds of $15.8 million. In December 2016, we entered into a sales agreement with FBR Capital Markets & Co. (\"FBR\") to create an at-the-market equity program under which we from time to time\nThe Baxalta collaboration agreement was considered to be a multiple-element arrangement for accounting purposes. We determined that there were two deliverables under the Baxalta agreement; specifically, the license to rigosertib for Europe and the related research and development services that\nResearch and development expenses decreased by $5.8 million, or 22.5%, to $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was caused primarily by a $3.7 million decrease in pre-clinical and clinical development costs in the 2016 period, as we focused our development efforts on the INSPIRE trial and worked to reduce expenses related to other programs or legacy studies. The clinical and preclinical decrease was comprised of a reduction of $3.7 million in expense in the 2016 period for the higher-risk MDS studies which preceded INSPIRE, offset by a $4.9 million increase in clinical expense related to INSPIRE. The clinical and preclinical decrease was also attributable to a decrease of $1.5 million in expense related to lower risk MDS studies in 2016, a decrease of $1.2 million in preclinical and sponsored research in 2016, and decrease of $2.2 million in expense related to our oral combination program, legacy studies, and other clinical costs during 2016. The decrease in research and development expenses in 2016 was also caused by a reduction of $0.5 million in API manufacturing costs and a reduction of $0.8 million in drug product manufacturing costs. Personnel and related costs were $0.8 million lower as research and development headcount was reduced to 15 at December 31, 2016 from 23 at December 31, 2015.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nFair Value Estimates\nClinical Trial Expense\n\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. Our clinical trial accrual process is designed to account for expenses resulting from our obligations under contracts with vendors, consultants and CROs and clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations, which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided to us under such contracts. Our objective is to reflect the appropriate clinical trial expenses in our consolidated financial statements by matching the appropriate expenses with the period in which services are provided and efforts are\nWe recorded deferred tax assets of $157.8 million as of December 31, 2016, which have been fully offset by a valuation allowance due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to realize these tax benefits.\nIncentive milestone payments may be triggered either by the results of our research efforts or by events external to us, such as regulatory approval to market a product. We recognize consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a milestone in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved, but only if the consideration earned from the achievement of a milestone meets all the criteria for the milestone to be considered substantive at the inception of the arrangement. For a milestone to be considered substantive, the consideration earned by achieving the milestone must be commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the item delivered as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone, relate solely to our past performance and be reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the collaboration agreement.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\nRevenues\nSince April 23, 2013, we estimate the fair value of share-based awards to employees and directors using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes model requires the input of highly complex and subjective assumptions, including (a) the expected stock price volatility, (b) the calculation of the expected term of the award, (c) the risk free interest rate and (d) expected dividends. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock since its IPO in July 2013. We estimate the expected life of our employee stock options using the \"simplified\" method, whereby, the expected life equals the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected life of the option are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect during the period the options were granted. We have never paid, and do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe recognized revenue of $5.0 million and $2.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, under our license and collaboration agreement with Baxalta. We recognized revenue of $0.5 million and $0.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, under our license and collaboration agreement with SymBio. We recognized revenue of $0 million and $8.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, under our funding agreement with LLS. The Baxalta and SymBio agreements are the only agreements that are being accounted for under ASU 2009-13.\nWe will recognize royalty revenue, if any, as earned in accordance with the contract terms when third-party sales can be reliably measured and collectability is reasonably assured.\namong other expenses. Additionally, if and when we believe a regulatory approval of a product candidate appears likely, we anticipate an increase in payroll and expense as a result of our preparation for commercial operations, especially as it relates to the sales and marketing of our product candidates.\nOperating Expenses\nperiods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. We adopted the new guidance as of December 31, 2016. Based on our current cash position and an evaluation of our expected future net cash outflows we have determined there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOn April 23, 2013, we distributed a notification letter to all holders of stock options under our 2007 Equity Compensation Plan advising them that cash settlement transactions would no longer occur, unless, at the time of a cash settlement transaction, the option holder has held the common stock issued upon exercise of options for a period of greater than six months prior to such cash settlement transaction and that any such settlement would be at the fair value of the common stock on the date of such sale. Following this notification, we reclassified options outstanding under our 2007 Equity Compensation Plan from liabilities to stockholders' deficit within our consolidated balance sheets. Upon issuing the notification, a modification to the liability awards occurred and the awards are now accounted for as equity awards from the date of modification with compensation expense fixed at fair value at the modification date. As a result, we reclassified the amount of stock-based compensation liability at the modification date to additional paid-in capital. The modification date fair value is recognized over the remaining service period, generally the vesting period, on a straight-line basis. The fair value of the modified awards was estimated on the modification date using the intrinsic value model. The grant date fair value of awards granted after the modification is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model, net of estimated forfeitures. Awards granted to non-employees will also be valued using the Black-Scholes valuation model and will be subject to periodic adjustment until the underlying equity instruments vest.\nResults of Operations\n\u2022 the cost of acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical trial materials;\nwe will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including the uncertainties of future clinical and preclinical studies, uncertainties in clinical trial enrollment rate and significant and changing government regulation. In addition, the probability of success for each product candidate will depend on numerous factors, including competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. We will determine which programs to pursue and how much to fund each program in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate, an assessment of each product candidate's commercial potential and our available funds.\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $0.\nTo date, our research and development expenses have related primarily to the development of rigosertib. We do not currently utilize a formal time allocation system to capture expenses on a project-by-project basis because we are organized and record expense by functional department and our employees may allocate time to more than one development project. Accordingly, we do not allocate expenses to individual projects or product candidates, although we do allocate some portion of our research and development expenses by functional area and by compound.\nCash Flows\narrangement. Revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned, as determined using the proportional performance model as of each reporting period. Alternatively, if we cannot make reasonably reliable estimates of the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement on a straight-line basis over the period expected to complete our performance obligations.\nIncome Taxes\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued guidance that addresses the income tax effects of stock-based payments and eliminates the windfall pool concept, as all of the tax effects related to stock-based payments will now be recorded at settlement (or expiration) through the income statement. The new guidance also permits entities to make an accounting policy election for the impact of forfeitures on the recognition of expense for stock-based payment awards. Forfeitures can be estimated or recognized when they occur. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period, with any adjustment reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We are currently evaluating the effect this standard may have on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nSegment Reporting\nThe SymBio collaboration agreement is also considered to be a multiple-element arrangement for accounting purposes. We determined that there were three deliverables under the SymBio collaboration agreement; specifically, the license to rigosertib for Japan and Korea, our obligation to perform research and development services necessary for SymBio to seek approval in its territory and our obligation to participate on a joint steering committee. We concluded that these deliverables should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting. We determined that the $7.5 million upfront payment received in 2011 should be deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis through December 2027, reflecting our estimate of when we will complete our obligations under the agreement. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized revenues of $455,000 and $455,000, respectively, under the SymBio collaboration agreement. In addition, we recognized revenues of $92,000 and $108,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the supply agreement with SymBio.\nIn April 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an \"emerging growth company\" can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an \"emerging growth company\" can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other companies.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will remain constant in the short-term, but would increase in the future with the continued research and development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. These increases will likely include increased costs for insurance, costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and payments to outside consultants\nOther income, net\nFor all periods presented, whenever we determine that an element is delivered over a period of time, we recognize revenue using either a proportional performance model or a straight-line model over the period of performance, which is typically the research and development term. We typically use progress achieved under our various CRO contracts as the measure of performance. At each reporting period, we reassess our cumulative measure of performance and make appropriate adjustments, if necessary. We recognize revenue using the proportional performance model whenever we can make reasonably reliable estimates of the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement. We recognize revenue under the proportional performance model at each reporting period by multiplying the total expected payments under the contract, excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of milestones, by the ratio of the level of effort incurred to date to the estimated total level of effort required to complete the performance obligations under the\nOur research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include:\nWe have not generated any revenue from commercial product sales. In the future, if any of our product candidates currently under development are approved for commercial sale in the United States or other territories where we have retained commercialization rights, we may generate revenue from product sales, or alternatively, we may choose to select a collaborator to commercialize our product candidates in these markets.\nour cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our ongoing trials and operations into the fourth quarter of 2017. Due to our ongoing operating losses and our accumulated deficit, in combination with the fact that the future success of the Company is dependent on its ability to obtain additional financing, the opinion of our independent registered public accounting firm on our audited consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 contains an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\n\u2022 costs associated with preclinical activities and regulatory operations.\nIn May 2010, we entered into a funding agreement with LLS to fund our ONTIME trial and certain related activities. We received $8.0 million under the LLS funding agreement, as amended, and terminated the funding agreement effective March 2013. As a result of the potential obligation to repay LLS, we initially recorded the funding received as deferred revenue. During the fourth quarter of 2015, however, we determined, based in part on the commencement of the INSPIRE trial, that the research program covered by the LLS funding agreement was unsuccessful and, as a result, the funding received non-repayable. Accordingly, we recognized $8.0 million of deferred revenue during the quarter ended December 31, 2015.\nwe were obligated to provide. We concluded that $42.4 million of the fixed and determinable $50.0 million upfront payment was associated with the license and $7.6 million was associated with the research and development services. We recognized the entire $42.4 million associated with the upfront license as revenue during the third quarter of 2012 upon the execution of the Baxalta agreement, and we recognized the research and development services revenue of $7.6 million on the proportional performance method over the period of commitment and development, which was estimated to be through March 31, 2014, the period of our non-contingent obligations to perform research and development services sufficient to advance rigosertib. In accordance with the agreement, we elected to have Baxalta fund fifty percent of the costs of the INSPIRE trial, up to $15.0 million. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $5.0 million and $2.9 million, respectively, of research and development services revenue related to Baxalta's funding of the INSPIRE trial. On March 3, 2016, we received notification of Baxalta's election to terminate the development and license agreement based on a strategic reprioritization review, effective August 30, 2016, at which time, the rights licensed to Baxalta reverted to us at no cost. Additionally, any rights we had to funding, pre-commercial milestone payments and royalties from Baxalta terminated in accordance with the agreement.\neliminating the use of the residual value method. The selling prices of deliverables under an arrangement may be derived using third-party evidence, or TPE, or a best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value, or VSOE, is not available. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the element within the license agreement was sold on a standalone basis. Establishing BESP involves management's judgment and takes into account multiple factors, including market conditions and company-specific factors, such as those factors contemplated in negotiating the agreements as well as internally developed models that include assumptions related to market opportunity, discounted cash flows, estimated development costs, probability of success, and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the license. In validating the BESP, management considers whether changes in key assumptions used to determine the BESP will have a significant effect on the allocation of the arrangement consideration between the multiple deliverables. We may use third-party valuation specialists to assist us in determining BESP. Deliverables under the arrangement are separate units of accounting if (i) the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and (ii) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially within our control. The arrangement consideration that is fixed or determinable at the inception of the arrangement is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling prices. The appropriate revenue recognition model is applied to each element and revenue is accordingly recognized as each element is delivered. Management exercises significant judgment in determining whether a deliverable is a separate unit of accounting.\nWarrants\nResearch and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and include, but are not limited to, license fees related to the acquisition of in-licensed products, employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and travel, expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and investigative sites that conduct clinical trials and preclinical studies, the cost of acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical trial materials, facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other supplies and costs associated with preclinical activities and regulatory operations.\nSince our inception, we have incurred net losses and generally negative cash flows from our operations. We incurred net losses of $19.7 million and $24.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Since inception our accumulated deficit is $338.2 million. We believe that\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in the revenue recognition standard issued in May 2014. The new standard clarifies how an entity should identify the unit of accounting (i.e. the specified good or service) for the principal versus agent evaluation and how it should apply the control principle to certain types of arrangements. The effective date and transition requirements are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in the May 2014 revenue standard (Accounting Standards Codification 606). We are currently assessing the adoption methodology and the impact the adoption of these ASUs will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and related disclosures.\nWe generate revenue primarily through collaborative research and license agreements. The terms of these agreements contain multiple deliverables, which may include licenses, research and development activities, participation in joint steering committees and product supply. The terms of these agreements may include nonrefundable upfront license fees, payments for research and development activities, payments based upon the achievement of specified milestones, royalty payments based on product sales derived from the collaboration, and payments for supplying product. In all instances, we recognize revenue only when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered, collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have fulfilled our performance obligations under the contract.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was due to proceeds from the sales of our common stock in our January 2016 offering and our July 2016 rights offering. In December 2016, we entered into a sales agreement with FBR to create an at-the-market equity program under which we from time to time may offer and sell shares of common stock through FBR. There were no sales of common stock under this program during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $0.4 million, or 3.7%, to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily caused by a decrease in professional fees and consulting fees of $0.5 million as we continued to focus on reducing non-core costs. The decrease was also caused by a $0.2 million decrease in facilities and related costs resulting from a reduction in general and administrative headcount to 8 at December 31, 2016 from 12 at December 31, 2015. Salaries and benefits for continuing employees was $0.5 million lower in the 2016 period, but that decrease was offset by $0.2 million greater of severance expense and $0.5 million higher bonuses paid to employees in the 2016 period. Investor relations and meetings expenses were $0.2 million higher in the 2016 period as the company attended and presented at more conferences.\nPrior to April 2013, our stock option awards were accounted for as liability awards as we, through our chairman of the board of directors, who is also a significant stockholder, had established a pattern of settling these awards for cash. Accordingly, we measured stock-based compensation expense at the end of each reporting period based on the intrinsic value of all outstanding vested stock options on each reporting date and recognized expense based on any increases in their intrinsic value since the last measurement date to the extent the stock options vested. The intrinsic value represented the difference between the current fair value of our common stock and the contractual exercise prices of the awards.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by applicable SEC regulations.\nFor events for which the occurrences are contingent solely upon the passage of time or are the result of performance by a third party, we will recognize the contingent payments as revenue when payments are earned, the amounts are fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.\n\nsales management, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure internally, we would have to invest financial and management resources, some of which would have to be deployed prior to having any certainty about marketing approval. Furthermore, we have and expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nInterest Expense and Other Income, Net", "item_7_text": "Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our revenues were derived exclusively from activities conducted in accordance with our collaboration arrangements with Baxalta and SymBio, as well as recognition of revenue from our May 2010 funding agreement with The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, or LLS. The following table sets forth a summary of revenue recognized during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\u2022 expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials and preclinical studies;\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel small molecule product candidates primarily to treat cancer. Using our proprietary chemistry platform, we have created an extensive library of targeted agents designed to work against cellular pathways important to cancer cells. We believe that the product candidates in our pipeline have the potential to be efficacious in a variety of cancers. We have one Phase 3 clinical-stage product candidate and two other clinical-stage product candidates (one of which is being developed for treatment of acute radiation syndromes) and several preclinical programs. Substantially all of our current effort is focused on our lead product candidate, rigosertib. Rigosertib is being tested in an intravenous formulation as a single agent, and an oral formulation in combination with azacitidine, in clinical trials for patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (\"MDS\").\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in December 1998 and commenced operations in January 1999. Our operations to date have included our organization and staffing, business planning, raising capital, in-licensing technology from research institutions, identifying potential product candidates, developing product candidates and building strategic alliances, as well as undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates.\nWe record costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials, based on our evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations, or information provided to us by our vendors on their actual costs incurred. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual arrangements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expense, as the case may be.\n\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in the short-term as the number of sites and enrolled patients related to our INSPIRE clinical trial increases.\nIt is difficult to determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of our current or future preclinical programs and clinical trials of our product candidates, or if, when or to what extent\nUnder a collaborative research and license agreement, a steering committee is typically responsible for overseeing the general working relationships, determining the protocols to be followed in the research and development performed, and evaluating the results from the continued development of the product. We evaluate whether our participation in joint steering committees is a substantive obligation or whether the services are considered inconsequential or perfunctory. The factors we consider in determining if our participation in a joint steering committee is a substantive obligation include: (i) which party negotiated or requested the steering committee, (ii) how frequently the steering committee meets, (iii) whether or not there are any penalties or other recourse if we do not attend the steering committee meetings, (iv) which party has decision making authority on the steering committee and (v) whether or not the collaborator has the requisite experience and expertise associated with the research and development of the licensed intellectual property.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $31.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and consisted primarily of a net loss of $24.1 million, partially offset by recognition of deferred revenue of $8.0 million related to LLS and $0.5 million related to our SymBio collaboration agreement, as well as $3.8 million of noncash stock-based compensation expense and $0.2 million of depreciation and amortization expense. Changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net decrease in cash of $2.6 million. Significant changes in operating assets and liabilities included an increase of $1.4 million in receivables, primarily due to our collaboration with Baxalta. Accrued expenses decreased $1.9 million due to lower accrued clinical costs and bonus, and the timing of invoices for clinical trial and manufacturing development costs related to the ongoing trials at December 31, 2015. Accounts payable decreased $0.6 million due to the timing of payments to our vendors. Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased $1.2 million as a result of the recognition of expense for clinical and manufacturing activities, as well as insurance expense. Restricted cash decreased $0.1 million due to the expiration of a letter of credit related to an office lease which was terminated during the first quarter of 2015.\nThe fair value of the warrant liability, which relates to warrants issued in January and July 2016, decreased $4.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to no change during the year ended December 31, 2015, which resulted in a commensurate increase in other income during the 2016 period. The decrease in the fair value of the warrant liability in 2016 was primarily due to the revaluation of the warrants outstanding. At December 31, 2016, warrants outstanding entitled the holders to purchase up to 3,288,864 shares of our common stock. These warrants expire in July 2021.\nNet cash provided by financing activities\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for executive and other administrative personnel, including stock-based compensation and travel expenses. Other general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs, communication expenses, insurance, board of directors expenses and professional fees for legal, patent review, consulting and accounting services.\nOther income (expense), net, was $62,000 of other income for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $35,000 of other expense for the year ended December 31, 2015. This change of $97,000 was due primarily to a foreign exchange gain of $1,000 in the 2016 period compared to a foreign exchange loss of $43,000 in the 2015 period, a $38,000 increase in interest income as a result of higher rates of return on cash equivalents during 2016, and the loss on the disposal of office equipment of $15,000 in the 2015 period.\nWe view our operations and manage our business in one segment, which is the identification and development of oncology therapeutics.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties in the financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. An entity must provide certain disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. The guidance applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses by functional area for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nPlease see \"Risk Factors\" for additional risks associated with our substantial capital requirements.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was due to proceeds from the sales of our common stock.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSince commencing operations, we have dedicated a significant portion of our resources to the development of our clinical-stage product candidates, particularly rigosertib. We incurred research and development expenses of $20.1 million and $25.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We anticipate that a significant portion of our operating expenses will continue to be related to research and development as we continue to advance our programs. In July 2013, we completed our initial public offering, or IPO, from which we received net proceeds of $79.8 million. Prior to the consummation of the IPO, we funded our operations primarily through the sale of preferred stock amounting to $144.7 million, the issuance of debt amounting to $26.8 million, which was later converted into shares of preferred stock, the receipt of $8.0 million from The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society under a May 2010 funding agreement, and the receipt of upfront payments of $57.5 million from Baxter (predecessor to Baxalta) and SymBio in connection with our collaboration agreements. Under the Baxalta collaboration agreement, we received payments towards costs for the INSPIRE trial of $5.0 million and $2.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Baxalta agreement was terminated on August 30, 2016 as a result of Baxalta's decision to terminate following its strategic review of priorities.\nRevenue\nWe record stock-based compensation expense as a component of research and development expenses or general and administrative expenses, depending on the function performed by the optionee. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we allocated stock-based compensation as follows:\nIn determining the separate units of accounting, we evaluate whether the license has standalone value to the collaborator based on consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances for each arrangement. Factors considered in this determination include the research and development capabilities of the collaborator and the availability of relevant research expertise in the marketplace. In addition, we consider whether or not (i) the collaborator can use the license for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining deliverables, (ii) the value of the license is dependent on the undelivered items and (iii) the collaborator or other vendors can provide the undelivered items.\nWarrants outstanding and warrant activity for the year ended December 31, 2016 is as follows:\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued guidance which supersedes much of the current guidance for leases. The new standard requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on their balance sheets for all the leases with terms greater than twelve months. Based on certain criteria, leases will be classified as either financing or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. For leases with a term of twelve months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. If a lessee makes this election, it should recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The modified retrospective approach includes a number of optional practical expedients primarily focused on leases that commenced before the effective date of the new guidance, including continuing to account for leases that commence before the effective date in accordance with previous guidance, unless the lease is modified. We are evaluating the impact of the adoption of the standard on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n\nJOBS Act\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the \"Risk Factors\" section of this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nRevenues decreased by $5.9 million, or 52%, in 2016 when compared to 2015 primarily as a result of recognizing $8.0 million of deferred revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015 from our May 2010 funding agreement with LLS. The decrease was partially offset by $2.1 million more contractual cost-sharing revenue from Baxalta for a portion of the costs of the INSPIRE trial in 2016 compared to the 2015 period.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nmay offer and sell shares of common stock through FBR. There were no sales of common stock under this program during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThis management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses, revenue recognition, deferred revenue and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nCommon stock warrants are accounted for in accordance with applicable accounting guidance provided in ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (ASC Topic 815), as either derivative liabilities or as equity instruments depending on the specific terms of the warrant agreement. Some of our warrants are classified as liabilities because in certain circumstances they could require cash settlement. We estimate the fair value of warrants accounted for as liabilities using the Black-Scholes pricing model.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued guidance requiring that amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning in 2018 and should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect of the standard on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. License fees and milestone payments we make related to in-licensed products and technology are expensed if it is determined that they have no alternative future use. We record costs for some development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors.\nStock-Based Compensation\nOverview\nWe have not achieved profitability since our inception and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. We expect net cash expended in 2017 to increase from 2016, due to the cessation of the cost-sharing payments from Baxalta and an increase in expenditures related to our INSPIRE trial, partially offset by savings from a workforce reduction. During 2016 we received $5.0 million in cost-sharing payments under our agreement with Baxalta which was terminated as of August 31, 2016. We expect expenditures related to our INSPIRE trial to increase in 2017 as clinical trial sites and patients are added. During 2016, we implemented workforce reductions of 12 employees which represents approximately 34 percent of our workforce. Affected employees were offered severance pay in accordance with our policy or, if applicable, their employment agreements. As a result of the workforce reduction, we recorded, severance-related charges totaling approximately $3.0 million, which included a non-cash charge of approximately $1.4 million related to the accelerated vesting of the outstanding stock options for certain of the affected employees. Savings from the workforce reduction should be fully realized during 2017. We may also incur other charges or cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of, or associated with, the workforce reduction.\nOther income, net consists principally of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalent balances and foreign exchange gains and losses.\n\nFinancial Overview\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\n\u2022 employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense;\nThe following table summarizes our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nThe deferred tax assets are primarily composed of federal and state tax net operating loss (\"NOL\"), carry forwards and research and development tax credit carry forwards. As of December 31, 2016, we had federal NOL carry forwards of $193.1 million, state NOL carry forwards of $154.4 million, and research and development tax credit carry forwards of $71.7 million available to reduce future taxable income, if any. These federal NOL carry forwards will begin to expire at various dates starting in 2022. The state NOL carry forwards will begin to expire at various dates starting in 2025. In general, if we experience a greater than 50 percentage point aggregate change in ownership of specified significant stockholders over a three-year period, utilization of our pre-change NOL carry forwards will be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\") and similar state laws. Such limitations may result in expiration of a portion of the NOL carry forwards before utilization and may be substantial. We have determined that we have experienced ownership changes in the past and approximately $24.0 million of our NOL carry forwards are subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 of the Code. If we experienced a Section 382 ownership change in connection with the offering or as a result of future changes in our stock ownership, some of which changes are outside our control, the tax benefits related to the NOL carry forwards may be further limited or lost.\nChange in fair value of warrant liability\nNet cash used in operating activities was $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and consisted primarily of a net loss of $19.7 million, and a change in the fair value of warrant liability of $4.0 million, partially offset by $3.9 million of noncash stock-based compensation expense and $0.1 million of depreciation and amortization expense. Changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net increase in cash of $3.8 million. Significant changes in operating assets and liabilities included a decrease of $1.5 million in receivables, primarily due collection of amounts due to us related to our collaboration with Baxalta. Accrued expenses increased $0.7 million due to higher accrued clinical costs and bonus, and the timing of invoices for clinical trial and manufacturing development costs related to the ongoing trials at December 31, 2016. Accounts payable increased $1.9 million due to the timing of payments to our vendors. Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased $0.2 million as a result of the recognition of expense for clinical and manufacturing activities, as well as insurance expense. Deferred revenue decreased $0.5 million related to the recognition of revenue on the up-front payment under our collaboration agreement with SymBio.\nWe do not have the funding resources necessary to carry out all of our proposed operating activities. We will need to obtain additional financing in the future in order to fully fund our INSPIRE trial and to further develop rigosertib or any other product candidates through the regulatory approval process. Accordingly, we may delay our ongoing clinical trials, including the INSPIRE trial, until we secure adequate additional funding. We may explore various dilutive and non-dilutive sources of funding, including equity and debt financings, strategic alliances, business development and other sources. If we raise additional funds through strategic collaborations and alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, which may including existing collaboration partners, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates, including rigosertib, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are unable to secure adequate additional funding, we will continue to delay, scale-back or eliminate certain of our planned research, drug discovery and development activities and certain other aspects of our operations and our business until such time as we are successful in securing adequate additional funding. As a result, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected. We will incur substantial costs beyond the present and planned clinical trials in order to file an NDA for rigosertib. The nature, design, size and cost of further studies, if required, will depend in large part on the outcome of preceding studies and discussions with regulators.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur net losses were $19.7 million and $24.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $338.2 million. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates, even if milestones under our license and collaboration agreements may be met.\nResearch and development expenses\nDuring 2016, we took significant actions to conserve cash, including reduction in personnel and expenditures. While we will continue to take cash conservation actions where appropriate, our net expenditures will increase in 2017, due to the termination of cost-sharing payments from Baxalta and as more INSPIRE sites open and more patients enroll in the INSPIRE trial. As of December 31, 2016, we had $21.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund our ongoing trials and operations into the fourth quarter of 2017, although there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. See \"-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Operating and Capital Expenditure Requirements.\"\nWhile we will continue to take cash conservation actions where appropriate, our net expenditures will increase in 2017, due to the termination of cost-sharing payments from Baxalta, the openings of more INSPIRE sites and more patients enrollments in the INSPIRE trial. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our ongoing trials and operations into the fourth quarter of 2017. However, due to our ongoing losses and our accumulated deficit in combination with these factors, the opinion of our independent registered public accounting firm on our audited consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 contains an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nexpended. We account for these expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured by patient progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial. We determine accrual estimates through financial models that take into account discussion with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of completion of trials, or the services completed. During the course of a clinical trial, we adjust our clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on the facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Our clinical trial accrual and prepaid assets are dependent, in part, upon the receipt of timely and accurate reporting from CROs and other third-party vendors. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low for any particular period.\nEffective January 1, 2011, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements , or ASU 2009-13. This guidance, which applies to multiple-element arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after January 1, 2011, amends the criteria for separating and allocating consideration in a multiple-element arrangement by modifying the fair value requirements for revenue recognition and\n\u2022 direct expenses for maintenance of research equipment, clinical trial insurance and other supplies; and\nNet cash provided by investing activities\nNet cash used in operating activities\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the fair value of our warrant liability for the year ended December 31, 2016:\nResearch and Development Expenses\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance permits the use of either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of the guidance to interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the impact of the amended guidance on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and related disclosures.\nWe are exploring various sources of funding for continued development of rigosertib in MDS and AML, as well as our ongoing operations. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates, even if milestones under our license and collaboration agreements may be met. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses. We do not currently have an organization for the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. We may rely on licensing and co-promotion agreements with strategic or collaborative partners for the commercialization of our products in the United States and other territories. If we choose to build a commercial infrastructure to support marketing in the United States for any of our product candidates that achieve regulatory approval, such commercial infrastructure could be expected to include a targeted, oncology sales force supported by\nDuring 2015 we sold 376,192 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $7.5 million. In January 2016, we completed a sale of common stock and warrants for net proceeds of approximately $1.6 million. In July 2016, we completed a rights offering of units of common stock and warrants for net proceeds of $15.8 million. In December 2016, we entered into a sales agreement with FBR Capital Markets & Co. (\"FBR\") to create an at-the-market equity program under which we from time to time\nThe Baxalta collaboration agreement was considered to be a multiple-element arrangement for accounting purposes. We determined that there were two deliverables under the Baxalta agreement; specifically, the license to rigosertib for Europe and the related research and development services that\nResearch and development expenses decreased by $5.8 million, or 22.5%, to $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was caused primarily by a $3.7 million decrease in pre-clinical and clinical development costs in the 2016 period, as we focused our development efforts on the INSPIRE trial and worked to reduce expenses related to other programs or legacy studies. The clinical and preclinical decrease was comprised of a reduction of $3.7 million in expense in the 2016 period for the higher-risk MDS studies which preceded INSPIRE, offset by a $4.9 million increase in clinical expense related to INSPIRE. The clinical and preclinical decrease was also attributable to a decrease of $1.5 million in expense related to lower risk MDS studies in 2016, a decrease of $1.2 million in preclinical and sponsored research in 2016, and decrease of $2.2 million in expense related to our oral combination program, legacy studies, and other clinical costs during 2016. The decrease in research and development expenses in 2016 was also caused by a reduction of $0.5 million in API manufacturing costs and a reduction of $0.8 million in drug product manufacturing costs. Personnel and related costs were $0.8 million lower as research and development headcount was reduced to 15 at December 31, 2016 from 23 at December 31, 2015.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nFair Value Estimates\nClinical Trial Expense\n\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. Our clinical trial accrual process is designed to account for expenses resulting from our obligations under contracts with vendors, consultants and CROs and clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations, which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided to us under such contracts. Our objective is to reflect the appropriate clinical trial expenses in our consolidated financial statements by matching the appropriate expenses with the period in which services are provided and efforts are\nWe recorded deferred tax assets of $157.8 million as of December 31, 2016, which have been fully offset by a valuation allowance due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to realize these tax benefits.\nIncentive milestone payments may be triggered either by the results of our research efforts or by events external to us, such as regulatory approval to market a product. We recognize consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a milestone in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved, but only if the consideration earned from the achievement of a milestone meets all the criteria for the milestone to be considered substantive at the inception of the arrangement. For a milestone to be considered substantive, the consideration earned by achieving the milestone must be commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the item delivered as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone, relate solely to our past performance and be reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the collaboration agreement.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\nRevenues\nSince April 23, 2013, we estimate the fair value of share-based awards to employees and directors using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes model requires the input of highly complex and subjective assumptions, including (a) the expected stock price volatility, (b) the calculation of the expected term of the award, (c) the risk free interest rate and (d) expected dividends. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock since its IPO in July 2013. We estimate the expected life of our employee stock options using the \"simplified\" method, whereby, the expected life equals the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected life of the option are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect during the period the options were granted. We have never paid, and do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe recognized revenue of $5.0 million and $2.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, under our license and collaboration agreement with Baxalta. We recognized revenue of $0.5 million and $0.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, under our license and collaboration agreement with SymBio. We recognized revenue of $0 million and $8.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, under our funding agreement with LLS. The Baxalta and SymBio agreements are the only agreements that are being accounted for under ASU 2009-13.\nWe will recognize royalty revenue, if any, as earned in accordance with the contract terms when third-party sales can be reliably measured and collectability is reasonably assured.\namong other expenses. Additionally, if and when we believe a regulatory approval of a product candidate appears likely, we anticipate an increase in payroll and expense as a result of our preparation for commercial operations, especially as it relates to the sales and marketing of our product candidates.\nOperating Expenses\nperiods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. We adopted the new guidance as of December 31, 2016. Based on our current cash position and an evaluation of our expected future net cash outflows we have determined there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOn April 23, 2013, we distributed a notification letter to all holders of stock options under our 2007 Equity Compensation Plan advising them that cash settlement transactions would no longer occur, unless, at the time of a cash settlement transaction, the option holder has held the common stock issued upon exercise of options for a period of greater than six months prior to such cash settlement transaction and that any such settlement would be at the fair value of the common stock on the date of such sale. Following this notification, we reclassified options outstanding under our 2007 Equity Compensation Plan from liabilities to stockholders' deficit within our consolidated balance sheets. Upon issuing the notification, a modification to the liability awards occurred and the awards are now accounted for as equity awards from the date of modification with compensation expense fixed at fair value at the modification date. As a result, we reclassified the amount of stock-based compensation liability at the modification date to additional paid-in capital. The modification date fair value is recognized over the remaining service period, generally the vesting period, on a straight-line basis. The fair value of the modified awards was estimated on the modification date using the intrinsic value model. The grant date fair value of awards granted after the modification is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model, net of estimated forfeitures. Awards granted to non-employees will also be valued using the Black-Scholes valuation model and will be subject to periodic adjustment until the underlying equity instruments vest.\nResults of Operations\n\u2022 the cost of acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical trial materials;\nwe will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including the uncertainties of future clinical and preclinical studies, uncertainties in clinical trial enrollment rate and significant and changing government regulation. In addition, the probability of success for each product candidate will depend on numerous factors, including competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. We will determine which programs to pursue and how much to fund each program in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate, an assessment of each product candidate's commercial potential and our available funds.\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $0.\nTo date, our research and development expenses have related primarily to the development of rigosertib. We do not currently utilize a formal time allocation system to capture expenses on a project-by-project basis because we are organized and record expense by functional department and our employees may allocate time to more than one development project. Accordingly, we do not allocate expenses to individual projects or product candidates, although we do allocate some portion of our research and development expenses by functional area and by compound.\nCash Flows\narrangement. Revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned, as determined using the proportional performance model as of each reporting period. Alternatively, if we cannot make reasonably reliable estimates of the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement on a straight-line basis over the period expected to complete our performance obligations.\nIncome Taxes\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued guidance that addresses the income tax effects of stock-based payments and eliminates the windfall pool concept, as all of the tax effects related to stock-based payments will now be recorded at settlement (or expiration) through the income statement. The new guidance also permits entities to make an accounting policy election for the impact of forfeitures on the recognition of expense for stock-based payment awards. Forfeitures can be estimated or recognized when they occur. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period, with any adjustment reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We are currently evaluating the effect this standard may have on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nSegment Reporting\nThe SymBio collaboration agreement is also considered to be a multiple-element arrangement for accounting purposes. We determined that there were three deliverables under the SymBio collaboration agreement; specifically, the license to rigosertib for Japan and Korea, our obligation to perform research and development services necessary for SymBio to seek approval in its territory and our obligation to participate on a joint steering committee. We concluded that these deliverables should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting. We determined that the $7.5 million upfront payment received in 2011 should be deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis through December 2027, reflecting our estimate of when we will complete our obligations under the agreement. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized revenues of $455,000 and $455,000, respectively, under the SymBio collaboration agreement. In addition, we recognized revenues of $92,000 and $108,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the supply agreement with SymBio.\nIn April 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an \"emerging growth company\" can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an \"emerging growth company\" can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other companies.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will remain constant in the short-term, but would increase in the future with the continued research and development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. These increases will likely include increased costs for insurance, costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and payments to outside consultants\nOther income, net\nFor all periods presented, whenever we determine that an element is delivered over a period of time, we recognize revenue using either a proportional performance model or a straight-line model over the period of performance, which is typically the research and development term. We typically use progress achieved under our various CRO contracts as the measure of performance. At each reporting period, we reassess our cumulative measure of performance and make appropriate adjustments, if necessary. We recognize revenue using the proportional performance model whenever we can make reasonably reliable estimates of the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement. We recognize revenue under the proportional performance model at each reporting period by multiplying the total expected payments under the contract, excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of milestones, by the ratio of the level of effort incurred to date to the estimated total level of effort required to complete the performance obligations under the\nOur research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include:\nWe have not generated any revenue from commercial product sales. In the future, if any of our product candidates currently under development are approved for commercial sale in the United States or other territories where we have retained commercialization rights, we may generate revenue from product sales, or alternatively, we may choose to select a collaborator to commercialize our product candidates in these markets.\nour cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our ongoing trials and operations into the fourth quarter of 2017. Due to our ongoing operating losses and our accumulated deficit, in combination with the fact that the future success of the Company is dependent on its ability to obtain additional financing, the opinion of our independent registered public accounting firm on our audited consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 contains an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\n\u2022 costs associated with preclinical activities and regulatory operations.\nIn May 2010, we entered into a funding agreement with LLS to fund our ONTIME trial and certain related activities. We received $8.0 million under the LLS funding agreement, as amended, and terminated the funding agreement effective March 2013. As a result of the potential obligation to repay LLS, we initially recorded the funding received as deferred revenue. During the fourth quarter of 2015, however, we determined, based in part on the commencement of the INSPIRE trial, that the research program covered by the LLS funding agreement was unsuccessful and, as a result, the funding received non-repayable. Accordingly, we recognized $8.0 million of deferred revenue during the quarter ended December 31, 2015.\nwe were obligated to provide. We concluded that $42.4 million of the fixed and determinable $50.0 million upfront payment was associated with the license and $7.6 million was associated with the research and development services. We recognized the entire $42.4 million associated with the upfront license as revenue during the third quarter of 2012 upon the execution of the Baxalta agreement, and we recognized the research and development services revenue of $7.6 million on the proportional performance method over the period of commitment and development, which was estimated to be through March 31, 2014, the period of our non-contingent obligations to perform research and development services sufficient to advance rigosertib. In accordance with the agreement, we elected to have Baxalta fund fifty percent of the costs of the INSPIRE trial, up to $15.0 million. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $5.0 million and $2.9 million, respectively, of research and development services revenue related to Baxalta's funding of the INSPIRE trial. On March 3, 2016, we received notification of Baxalta's election to terminate the development and license agreement based on a strategic reprioritization review, effective August 30, 2016, at which time, the rights licensed to Baxalta reverted to us at no cost. Additionally, any rights we had to funding, pre-commercial milestone payments and royalties from Baxalta terminated in accordance with the agreement.\neliminating the use of the residual value method. The selling prices of deliverables under an arrangement may be derived using third-party evidence, or TPE, or a best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value, or VSOE, is not available. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the element within the license agreement was sold on a standalone basis. Establishing BESP involves management's judgment and takes into account multiple factors, including market conditions and company-specific factors, such as those factors contemplated in negotiating the agreements as well as internally developed models that include assumptions related to market opportunity, discounted cash flows, estimated development costs, probability of success, and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the license. In validating the BESP, management considers whether changes in key assumptions used to determine the BESP will have a significant effect on the allocation of the arrangement consideration between the multiple deliverables. We may use third-party valuation specialists to assist us in determining BESP. Deliverables under the arrangement are separate units of accounting if (i) the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and (ii) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially within our control. The arrangement consideration that is fixed or determinable at the inception of the arrangement is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling prices. The appropriate revenue recognition model is applied to each element and revenue is accordingly recognized as each element is delivered. Management exercises significant judgment in determining whether a deliverable is a separate unit of accounting.\nWarrants\nResearch and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and include, but are not limited to, license fees related to the acquisition of in-licensed products, employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and travel, expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and investigative sites that conduct clinical trials and preclinical studies, the cost of acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical trial materials, facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other supplies and costs associated with preclinical activities and regulatory operations.\nSince our inception, we have incurred net losses and generally negative cash flows from our operations. We incurred net losses of $19.7 million and $24.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Since inception our accumulated deficit is $338.2 million. We believe that\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in the revenue recognition standard issued in May 2014. The new standard clarifies how an entity should identify the unit of accounting (i.e. the specified good or service) for the principal versus agent evaluation and how it should apply the control principle to certain types of arrangements. The effective date and transition requirements are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in the May 2014 revenue standard (Accounting Standards Codification 606). We are currently assessing the adoption methodology and the impact the adoption of these ASUs will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and related disclosures.\nWe generate revenue primarily through collaborative research and license agreements. The terms of these agreements contain multiple deliverables, which may include licenses, research and development activities, participation in joint steering committees and product supply. The terms of these agreements may include nonrefundable upfront license fees, payments for research and development activities, payments based upon the achievement of specified milestones, royalty payments based on product sales derived from the collaboration, and payments for supplying product. In all instances, we recognize revenue only when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered, collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have fulfilled our performance obligations under the contract.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was due to proceeds from the sales of our common stock in our January 2016 offering and our July 2016 rights offering. In December 2016, we entered into a sales agreement with FBR to create an at-the-market equity program under which we from time to time may offer and sell shares of common stock through FBR. There were no sales of common stock under this program during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $0.4 million, or 3.7%, to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily caused by a decrease in professional fees and consulting fees of $0.5 million as we continued to focus on reducing non-core costs. The decrease was also caused by a $0.2 million decrease in facilities and related costs resulting from a reduction in general and administrative headcount to 8 at December 31, 2016 from 12 at December 31, 2015. Salaries and benefits for continuing employees was $0.5 million lower in the 2016 period, but that decrease was offset by $0.2 million greater of severance expense and $0.5 million higher bonuses paid to employees in the 2016 period. Investor relations and meetings expenses were $0.2 million higher in the 2016 period as the company attended and presented at more conferences.\nPrior to April 2013, our stock option awards were accounted for as liability awards as we, through our chairman of the board of directors, who is also a significant stockholder, had established a pattern of settling these awards for cash. Accordingly, we measured stock-based compensation expense at the end of each reporting period based on the intrinsic value of all outstanding vested stock options on each reporting date and recognized expense based on any increases in their intrinsic value since the last measurement date to the extent the stock options vested. The intrinsic value represented the difference between the current fair value of our common stock and the contractual exercise prices of the awards.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by applicable SEC regulations.\nFor events for which the occurrences are contingent solely upon the passage of time or are the result of performance by a third party, we will recognize the contingent payments as revenue when payments are earned, the amounts are fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.\n\nsales management, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure internally, we would have to invest financial and management resources, some of which would have to be deployed prior to having any certainty about marketing approval.
