This increase includes sales from our August 13, 2018 acquisition of WWS, which totaled $49.7 million, but also resulted from increases in sales of our aluminum and vinyl impact-resistant products, which grew by 28.5% and 32.3%, respectively. Driving these results were increases in the sales of our flagship WinGuard impact-resistant products, including vinyl WinGuard impact-resistant products, which grew by 35.5%, and our aluminum WinGuard impact-resistant products, which grew by 26.4%, both as compared to 2017. Since 2014, our vinyl WinGuard products have grown at a compound annual rate of nearly 35%. The growth in the sales of our vinyl impact products highlights the shift in our markets towards more energy efficient products and our ability to design attractive and innovative windows and doors to meet those needs. We also believe our sales in 2018 benefitted from the heightened awareness of impact-resistant products as the result of Hurricane Irma, which hit our primary markets in mid-September 2017, and our increased advertising following Hurricane Irma. Excluding sales of WWS, our annual sales to the repair and remodel market increased by $104.4 million, or 33.6%, in 2018, as compared to 2017, while new construction sales increased $33.3 million, or 16.6%. By region, our annual sales in Florida increased $111.7 million, or 24.3%, for 2018 compared to 2017, and sales in our out-of-state markets increased $60.0 million, or 169.9%. The increase in out-of-state sales is primarily due to the inclusion of the post-acquisition sales of WWS, which are primarily in the western and southwestern U.S. The remaining increase was related to an increase in international sales.\nGross profit was $243.5 million for our 2018 fiscal year, which increased 53.1% when compared to 2017. Our gross profit increased primarily due to higher sales volume, but also benefitted from price increases in 2018, as well as improvements in operational performance, which generated increased efficiencies, and a decrease in scrap rates. Our gross profit also benefitted from product mix. However, inflationary conditions persisted through all of 2018, including in the cost of aluminum, after increasing significantly during the second half of 2017, remained high during the first half of 2018, but then has subsided through the end of 2018. For example, the per-pound market cash price of aluminum, not including the Midwest Premium charge for delivery, began the year at $1.11, but has decreased to $0.85 at the end of the year, and is approximately $0.83 in mid-February 2019. We increased prices for our products during 2018 to cover these cost increases, but in the future, we may not always be able to offset cost increases we incur by increasing our selling prices.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $150.9 million for our 2018 fiscal year, which increased $52.1 million compared to 2017, which includes the SG&A of WWS of $19.5 million, as well as the related acquisition costs of $3.8 million. Higher selling and distribution costs were the main driver of this increase, which is directly related to the significant increase in sales. The second most significant factor was higher personnel-related costs, including higher incentive compensation-related costs due to our improved performance, but also relating to a higher number of employees. Also, beginning in late 2017 after Hurricane Irma, we increased our investment in advertising, and maintained higher advertising levels during 2018 to further promote, in the post-Hurricane Irma environment, the benefits of our impact-resistant products. There was also an increase in depreciation expense during 2018 that contributed to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as compared to last year.\nInterest expense increased $6.2 million in 2018, compared to 2017. During 2018, we made a total of $160.3 million in payments of long-term debt, substantially all relating to repayments of borrowings under the term loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, which resulted in non-cash write-offs of deferred lenders fees and discount totaling $5.6 million as additional interest\n- 21 -\nexpense. Excluding these charges, interest expense increased slightly, as the savings from prepayments of borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, were more than offset by interest by the issuance of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026, which carry a fixed interest rate of 6.75%.\nOur net income in 2018 was $53.9 million, an increase of $14.1 million when compared to 2017's net income of $39.8 million. Our net income benefitted from improved performance, including a significant increase in sales, and the addition of WWS. The comparison of 2018 net income to 2017 net income is also affected by the fact that net income in 2017 benefitted from the recognition of the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, further described below. In December 2017, we revalued our ending net deferred tax liabilities at December 30, 2017 and recognized a $12.4 million tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 30, 2017, which was adjusted slightly by $0.2 million in tax expense in 2018.\nLiquidity and Cash Flow\nDuring 2018, we generated $100.3 million in cash flow from operations, an increase of $51.3 million over last year, which was used to fund the cash portion of the WWS Acquisition of $39.6 million, make voluntary prepayments of debt of $8.0 million, as well as fund working capital needs, and for capital expenditures of $29.8 million. Our cash flow in 2018 benefitted from proceeds received under the APA, described below, of $24.8 million, but also was reduced by payments of estimated income taxes of $19.5 million, including a federal income tax payment of $9.0 million, relating to our fourth quarter of 2017 estimated payment which was not required to be made until the end of January 2018 due to temporary relief on estimated tax payments for Florida businesses affected by Hurricane Irma.\nDuring 2018, we executed on two major capital transactions: (1) the issuance of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026; and (2) the 2018 Equity Issuance. The transactions provided substantial liquidity, the proceeds from which were used to acquire WWS, in the case of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 and used to make a prepayment of borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, in the case of the 2018 Equity Issuance. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for a more detailed discussion of these events.\nSALE OF DOOR GLASS PROCESSING ASSETS\nOn September 22, 2017, we entered into the APA with Cardinal for the sale to Cardinal of certain manufacturing equipment we used in processing glass components for PGT-branded doors for a cash purchase price of $28.0 million. Contemporaneously with entering into the APA, we entered into a seven-year supply agreement (SA) with Cardinal for Cardinal to supply us with glass components for PGT-branded doors. The Company determined to sell these assets and enter the SA to allow us to heighten our focus in our core areas of window and door manufacturing and, at the same time, strengthen our supply chain for high-quality door glass from a supplier with whom we have been doing business for many years.\nThe Company has determined that, although the APA and SA are separate agreements, they were negotiated contemporaneously. Therefore, the Company has concluded that the $28.0 million of proceeds under the APA should be bifurcated between the sale of the door glass manufacturing assets, and as payment received from a supplier for the Company's agreement to buy glass components for PGT-branded doors from Cardinal under the SA. The bifurcation of the proceeds in excess of the stand-alone selling price of the assets acquired would be allocated to the SA and recognized as a reduction of cost of sales as glass components are purchased by PGTI. Based on the established stand-alone selling price of the assets sold, as determined by an independent appraisal, approximately $7.7 million was allocated to the sale of the assets, with the remaining $20.3 million representing consideration received from Cardinal related to the agreement to buy door glass components for PGT-branded doors from Cardinal. This consideration is being amortized over the 7-year term of the SA.\nAt the time we ceased using these assets in production, at which time they became available for immediate sale, their net book value was $4.7 million, and they were reclassified from property, plant and equipment, to assets held for sale within other current assets.\nThe APA provided for the transfer of the assets from the Company to Cardinal in two phases, with the first date in 2017, and the second date in 2018, on dates which the Company and Cardinal agree to use. Under the APA, the cash purchase price of $28.0 million was to be paid by Cardinal to the Company in three separate payments of $3 million on or about the time of the first transfer of the assets to Cardinal, $10 million on or about January 15, 2018, and $15 million at or about the time of the second transfer of assets to Cardinal.\nCardinal paid us $3.0 million in cash on November 1, 2017, $10.0 million in cash on January 16, 2018, and $14.8 million on June 8, 2018, pursuant to the APA. The total proceeds received of $27.8 million was $0.2 million less than the $28.0 million as specified in the APA as we retained certain assets that were initially identified for transfer. On December 15, 2017, machinery and equipment classified as assets held for sale with net book value of $1.5 million, and fair value of $1.9 million was transferred to Cardinal and their equipment rigger, and we recognized a gain for the difference. Substantially all of the remaining machinery and equipment was transferred to Cardinal during the second quarter of 2018, which had a net book value of $3.2 million and fair value of\n- 22 -\n$5.8 million. We recognized gains on disposals for the difference totaling $2.6 million during the year ended December 29, 2018, classified as a separate line item in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 29, 2018.\nThe SA provides that the Company will purchase, and Cardinal will supply, all the Company's requirements for certain glass components used in PGT-branded doors through the end of 2024. The terms of the manufacture by Cardinal and purchase by the Company of such glass components as to purchase orders, forecasts of purchases, pricing, invoicing, delivery and payment terms and other terms, are all as described in the SA. Early in the fourth quarter of 2017, we began purchasing and receiving glass components from Cardinal under the SA. At that time, we began amortizing the advance consideration received from Cardinal initially allocated to the SA, recognizing $628 thousand in the year ended December 30, 2017, and $2.8 million and in the year ended December 29, 2018, which is classified as reductions to cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The remaining unamortized balance of $16.7 million is classified in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 29, 2018, as $2.8 million within accrued liabilities and $13.9 million within other liabilities.\nTHE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act\u201d). The Tax Act includes significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system, including a Federal corporate rate reduction from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation, the elimination of the Section 199 domestic production activities deduction, and further restricting the deductibility of certain already restricted expenses.\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the Tax Act, the Company revalued its ending net deferred tax liabilities at December 30, 2017 and recognized a $12.4 million tax benefit in the Company's consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 30, 2017. Upon the filing of our Federal and state income tax return for 2017, in the third quarter of 2018, we recognized an adjustment to this gain of $0.2 million of tax expense.\nThe Company has recognized the tax impacts related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017. In 2018, we experienced a benefit to our cash flow and a decrease in our overall effective tax rate as the result of the reduction of the Federal corporate income tax rate under the Tax Act, partially offset by the negative impact from the repeal of the Section 199 domestic production activities deduction. In 2018, we had no significant effect on our tax rate or obligation to pay income taxes due to the limitations on the deductions for interest expense and executive compensation.\n- 23 -\nRESULTS OF

door products, which include our PGT WinGuard products, as well as all of CGI's products and the substantial majority of WinDoor's products, were $561.8 million in 2018, an increase of $128.4 million, or 29.6%, driven by an increase in sales of our WinGuard products, primarily our vinyl WinGuard products. Included in sales of our impact-resistant window and door products for 2018 were $391.1 million of aluminum impact sales, an increase of $86.7 million, or 28.5%, and $170.7 million of vinyl impact sales, an increase of $41.7 million, or 32.3%.\nSales of our non-impact window and door products were $136.7 million in 2018, an increase of $59.0 million, or 76.0%. Driving this increase are the sales of WWS, our recently acquired window and door manufacturer in the western U.S., whose products\n- 24 -\nare all considered to be non-impact windows and door products. Sales of WWS included in non-impact window and door products were $49.7 million in 2018.\nOur non-impact window and door products included $72.8 million of aluminum non-impact sales, an increase of $47.9 million, or 192.8%, and $63.9 million of vinyl non-impact sales, an increase of $11.1 million, or 21.1%. Included in sales of WWS's window and door products were $43.3 million of aluminum non-impact sales, and $6.4 million of vinyl non-impact sales.\nGross profit and gross margin\nGross profit was $243.5 million in 2018, an increase of $84.5 million, or 53.1%, from $159.0 million in the prior year. The gross margin percentage was 34.9% in 2018, compared to 31.1% in the prior year, a percentage-point increase of 3.8%. Adjusting for costs relating to machinery and equipment relocations, as well as an opening balance sheet inventory adjustment relating to our acquisition of WWS, for a total of $1.2 million in 2018, and adjusting for costs relating to Hurricane Irma, WinDoor leadership and glass supply-chain transition costs, and costs relating to the start-up of our Thermal Plastic Spacer system line incurred in January and February, totaling $2.1 million in 2017, the gross margin percentage was 35.0% in 2018, compared to 31.5% in 2017, a percentage-point increase of 3.5%. There were improvements in 2018, compared to last year, relating to higher contribution margins on the increased sales volume, which benefitted gross margin by 1.2%, price increases, which benefitted gross margin by 1.5%, in scrap rates and efficiencies, which benefitted gross margin by 1.0%, a change in mix towards a higher portion of repair and remodeling sales, which benefitted gross margin by 0.7%. These increases were partially offset by decreases due to higher overall material prices, which decreased gross margin by 1.1%, and which included higher aluminum prices compared to last year, partially offset by lower glass costs as a result of our supply agreement with Cardinal Glass Industries, and by higher overhead costs, which decreased gross margin by 1.2%. The addition of WWS benefitted gross margin by 1.4%.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for 2018 were $150.9 million, an increase of $52.1 million, or 52.7%, from $98.8 million in the prior year. SG&A in 2018 includes $3.8 million of acquisition costs relating to our recent acquisition of WWS, and in 2017 includes $2.3 million in higher costs related to Hurricane Irma, management reorganization and WinDoor transition actions. Adjusting for these costs in both periods, SG&A was $147.1 million in 2018, or 21.1% of net sales, compared to $96.5 million in 2017, or 18.9% of net sales, an increase of 2.2%. The adjusted increase in SG&A is primarily the result of the inclusion of the SG&A expenses of WWS in 2018 since the acquisition, which totaled $19.5 million, including $3.6 million in non-cash amortization of the amortizable intangible asset acquired in the acquisition. This represents 39.3% of the total sales contribution of WWS of $49.7 million in 2018. We believe that going forward, WWS will carry higher SG&A as a percentage of sales than our legacy business due to WWS's higher transportation costs, and non-cash amortization expense, which we estimate will be approximately $9.4 million annually.\nExcluding these items, SG&A of the legacy business was $127.6 million in 2018, or 19.7% of legacy business net sales, compared to $96.5 million in 2017, or 18.9%, an increase of $31.1 million. This increase in SG&A spending is consistent with the higher level of sales, including higher distribution costs, and also includes higher personnel-related costs of approximately $10.7 million, which includes higher incentive compensation reflecting the improved performance in 2018 compared to last year, an increase of $2.4 million due to our strategic investment in additional marketing and advertising initiatives during 2018, as well as an increase in stock-based compensation expenses of $1.4 million in 2018, compared to last year.\nWe record warranty costs as a selling expense within selling, general and administrative expenses. During 2018, we recorded warranty expense at a rate of 1.7% of sales, which decreased when compared to the rate in 2017 of 2.1% of sales. We believe the decrease in warranty expense as a percentage of sales was the result of our workforce becoming more seasoned through experience and training, as well as a change in our warranty profile on PGT-branded door glass components produced by Cardinal as part of the SA on which they provide the warranty coverage.\nGains on sales of assets under APA\nOn September 22, 2017, we entered into the APA with Cardinal for the sale to Cardinal of certain manufacturing equipment we used in processing glass components for PGT-branded doors. Substantially all of the remaining machinery and equipment was transferred to Cardinal during the second quarter of 2018, which had a net book value of $3.2 million and fair value of $5.8 million. We recognized gains on disposals for the difference totaling $2.6 million during 2018, classified as a separate line item in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 29, 2018.\n- 25 -\nInterest expense\nInterest expense was $26.5 million in 2018, an increase of $6.2 million from $20.3 million in the prior year. Interest expense in 2018 includes $5.6 million of accelerated amortization of lenders fees and discount relating to the prepayment of $152.0 million of borrowings under the term loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 we made on September 18, 2018 and the voluntary prepayment of $8.0 million we made on December 19, 2018. Excluding this amount, the decrease in interest expense due to a decrease in the average level of outstanding borrowings under the term loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 as the result of the prepayments made during 2018 and 2017, were offset by interest expense from the issuance of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026, composed of $315.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% unsecured senior notes due 2026. The 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 carry a higher per-annum interest rate and have a higher principal amount outstanding than borrowings under the term loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022.\nDebt extinguishment costs\nDebt extinguishment costs were $3.4 million in 2018. In connection with the Second Amendment, certain existing lenders changed their positions in or exited the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, which resulted in the write-offs of portions of the deferred financing costs and original issue discount allocated to these lenders. Additionally, at the time of the issuance of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026, certain existing lenders reduced their positions in the revolving credit portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, which resulted in the write-offs of the deferred financing costs allocated to these lenders. As such, write-offs totaling $3.4 million is classified as debt extinguishment costs in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 29, 2018.\nEffective on February 17, 2017, we repriced and amended our 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 for the first time. As there were no changes in lender positions, this action did not result in any modifications or extinguishments of debt. Therefore, there was no charge for debt extinguishment costs in 2017.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense was $11.3 million for 2018, representing an effective tax rate of 17.3%. This compares to income tax expense of $63 thousand for 2017, representing an effective tax rate of 0.2%. Income tax expense in 2018, and 2017, includes excess tax benefits relating to exercises of stock options and lapses of restrictions on stock awards, treated as a discrete item of income tax, totaling $5.2 million and $1.8 million, respectively. Also, income tax expense includes a $12.4 million tax benefit in 2017 due to the revaluation of our ending net deferred tax liabilities at December 30, 2017 as the result of the Tax Act, which was reduced slightly by an adjustment of a $0.2 million tax expense in 2018.\nExcluding the effects of these discrete items in income tax expense, and certain tax credits received in each period, our effective tax rate in 2018 would have been 25.7%, compared to 36.8% in 2017.\nAs a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted effective on December 22, 2017, our Federal corporate income tax rate has been reduced from 35%, to 21%. This reduction in rate has lowered our overall effective tax rate. Additionally, the section 199 domestic manufacturing deduction was repealed. As such, our effective tax rate, excluding the discrete items discussed above, approximates our current combined statutory federal and state rate of approximately 25.5% for 2018. In 2017, the effective tax rate, excluding the effect of the discrete item discussed above, was lower than our then combined statutory federal and state tax rate of 38.8% primarily as the result of the estimated impact of the section 199 domestic manufacturing deduction.\nWe expect to continue to be profitable in 2019, and thus, that we will incur income tax expense at a combined Federal and state effective rate of between approximately 26% to 27%. This rate is based on the lower overall corporate income tax rate of 21% as the result of the Tax Act, plus a blended statutory state rate, taking into consideration the effect on our state rate due to our recent acquisition of WWS.\n- 26 -\n2017 Compared with 2016\nNet sales\nNet sales for 2017 were $511.1 million, a $52.5 million, or 11.5%, increase in sales, from $458.6 million in the prior year.\nThe following table shows net sales classified by major product category (in millions, except percentages):\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product category:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impact-resistant window and door products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 433.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 84.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 381.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-impact window and door products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 511.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 458.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales of our impact window and door products, which include our PGT WinGuard products, as well as all of CGI's products and the substantial majority of WinDoor's products, were $433.4 million in 2017, an increase of $51.8 million, or 13.6%, driven by an increase in sales of our WinGuard products, primarily our vinyl WinGuard products. Included in sales of our impact-resistant window and door products for 2017 were $304.4 million of aluminum impact sales, an increase of $26.5 million, or 9.5%, and $129.0 million of vinyl impact sales, an increase of $25.3 million, or 24.4%.\nSales of our non-impact window and door products increased by $0.7 million, or 0.9%. Included in sales of our non-impact window and door products were $24.9 million of aluminum non-impact sales, a decrease of $2.0 million, or 7.5%, and $52.8 million of vinyl non-impact sales, an increase of $2.7 million, or 5.4%.\nGross profit and gross margin\nGross profit was $159.0 million in 2017, an increase of $18.9 million, or 13.5%, from $140.1 million in the prior year. The gross margin percentage was 31.1% in 2017, compared to 30.6% in the prior year, a percentage-point increase of 0.5%. Adjusting for costs relating to Hurricane Irma, WinDoor leadership and glass supply-chain transition costs, and costs relating to the start-up of our Thermal Plastic Spacer system line incurred in January and February, totaling $2.1 million in 2017, and product line termination costs and costs relating to the start-up of our Thermal Plastic Spacer system line incurred totaling $1.6 million in 2016, the gross margin percentage was 31.5% in 2017, compared to 30.9% in 2016, a percentage-point increase of 0.6%. Gross margin was positively impacted by several factors, including improvements in scrap rates and production efficiencies at our PGT and CGI facilities, and a favorable change in product mix, each of which benefitted gross margin by 0.6%, from price increases announced during 2017, which benefitted gross margin by 0.5%, and a favorable impact on higher sales volume, which benefitted gross margin by 0.3%. These improvements were partially offset by decreases resulting from higher material costs, primarily due to the increase in aluminum prices during 2017, which decreased gross margin by 0.7%, higher depreciation, decreasing margin by 0.6%, and due to WinDoor, which negatively impacted gross margin by 0.1%.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for 2017 were $98.8 million, an increase of $14.8 million, or 17.6%, from $84.0 million in the prior year. As a percentage of net sales, these costs were 19.3% in 2017, an increase of 1.0% from 18.3% in 2016. Contributing to the increase was a $2.5 million increase in selling and distribution costs as the result of an increase in volume, and due to distribution disruptions caused by Hurricane Irma, as well as increased spending for advertising following Hurricane Irma. There were also increases in personnel-related costs of $6.6 million primarily due to higher accrued incentive costs as a result of the Company's improved performance. Also contributing to the increase were $1.0 million of costs from our attendance at and participation in the National Association of Home Builders' International Builders Show in Orlando, Florida in January 2017, $0.9 million in higher depreciation expense on higher recent capital spending, and due to higher bank credit card fees of $0.6 million due to higher credit card collections. Selling, general and administrative expenses also increased due to costs relating to our community outreach activities which we undertook to assist those affected by Hurricane Irma. The remaining increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is related to an increase in the level of administrative activities.\nWe record warranty costs as a selling expense within selling, general and administrative expenses. Our warranty expense, as a percentage of sales, decreased during 2017, with an average rate of 2.1%, as compared to an average rate of 2.4% during 2016. The decrease in warranty expense as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of our workforce becoming more seasoned through experience and training. We expect that, as our team members continue to gain in experience, and are exposed to improved training initiatives we have implemented, and as we realize the quality-related benefits of our new thermal plastic spacer (TPS) system, an innovative technology for production of insulated glass, our warranty expense, as a percentage of sales, will further decline. We expect that our warranty risk profile has improved due to the SA we entered into with Cardinal in September 2017, pursuant to which the glass components we purchase from Cardinal are warrantied by Cardinal and, thus, any warranty costs for those glass components will be borne by Cardinal.\n- 27 -\nInterest expense\nInterest expense was $20.3 million in 2017, an increase of $0.2 million from $20.1 million in the prior year. During 2017, we made a total of $40 million voluntary prepayments of borrowings under our 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, which resulted in non-cash write-offs of deferred lenders fees and discount of $1.9 million, classified as interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 30, 2017. These charges offset the savings generated over prior year from our debt repricing we completed in February 2017, which resulted in a one percentage-point decrease in the margin portion of the interest rate, and lower debt levels from previous prepayments. Additionally, we saw increases in LIBOR during 2017, which increased the weighted average interest rate we paid during 2017 since the beginning of the year.\nIncome tax expense\nOur income tax expense was $63 thousand for 2017, representing an effective tax rate of 0.2%. This compares to income tax expense of $11.8 million for 2016, representing an effective tax rate of 33.2%. Income tax expense in 2017, includes a $12.4 million tax benefit due to the revaluation of our ending net deferred tax liabilities at December 30, 2017 as the result of the Tax Act, Income tax expense in 2017 also includes excess tax benefits totaling $1.8 million. We adopted ASU 2016-09 effective on January 1, 2017. As a result, excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options and lapse of restriction on stock awards are now recognized as a discrete item in tax expense, where previously such tax effects had been recognized in additional paid-in-capital. Income tax expense in 2017 also benefitted from tax credits totaling $0.4 million, including estimated federal income tax credits recognized related to our research and development efforts for 2017, and state incentive tax credits.\nIncome tax expense in 2016, benefitted from tax credits totaling $1.2 million, including federal income tax credits recognized related to our research and development efforts for tax years 2012 through 2016, and state incentive tax credits.\nExcluding the effects of these discrete items in income tax expense, our effective tax rate in 2017 would have been 36.8%, compared to 36.5% in 2016, slightly lower than our combined statutory federal and state tax rate of 38.8%, primarily as the result of the section 199 domestic manufacturing deduction in both years.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur principal source of liquidity is cash flow generated by operations, supplemented by borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, if ever needed. Our cash generating capability provides us with financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs. Our primary capital requirements are to fund working capital needs, and to meet required debt payments, including debt service payments on borrowings and fund capital expenditures.\nConsolidated Cash Flows\nOperating activities. Cash provided by operating activities was $100.3 million for 2018, compared to $49.0 million for 2017, and compared to $46.4 million for 2016.\nThe increase in cash flows from operations of $51.3 million in 2018 was primarily due to an increase of $187.2 million in collections from customers as the result of increased sales. This increase in collections was partially offset by an increase in payments to suppliers of $118.2 million as the result of higher procurements of inventory due to increased sales, an increase in personnel related disbursements of $24.8 million due to the higher level of employees during 2018, compared to 2017 to support the increase in demand for our products, and a decrease in debt service costs of $5.2 million, primarily as the fact that the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 require semi-annual interest payments, compared to quarterly payments of interest under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022. Accrued interest at December 29, 2018 related to the 2018 Senior notes due 2026 was $8.3 million. Debt service costs decreased also as a result of prepayments of borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 made during 2018. Also, in 2018, compared to last year, net tax payments increased $19.5 million, which includes a federal tax payment of $9.0 million in January 2018 as the result of our ability to defer our fourth quarter 2017 estimated payment due to the extension of time to January 2018 to make that payment pursuant to the IRS extension of time for companies affected by Hurricane Irma. We also received cash totaling $19.0 million in 2018 from Cardinal under the SA. Other collections of cash and other cash activity, net, increased by $2.4 million, primarily related to sales of scrap aluminum.\nThe increase in cash flows from operations of $2.6 million in 2017 compared to 2016, was primarily due to an increase of $42.5 million in collections from customers as the result of increased sales. This increase in collections was partially offset by an increase in payments to suppliers of $34.6 million as the result of higher procurements of inventory due to increased sales, an increase in personnel related disbursements of $8.8 million due to the higher level of employees during 2017, compared to 2016 to support the increase in demand for our products, and an increase in debt service costs of $0.3 million, primarily as the result of an increase in LIBOR during 2017, partially offset by lower debt levels from voluntary debt prepayments made during 2017, and a one percentage-point decrease in our margin from the February 2017 refinancing. Also, in 2017 compared to last year, net tax payments decreased $2.2 million, A federal and state income tax liability of $6.5 million was included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying\n- 28 -\nconsolidated balance sheet at December 30, 2017, primarily as the result of our ability to defer our fourth quarter 2017 estimated payment due to the extension of time to January 2018 to make that payment pursuant to the IRS extension of time for companies affected by Hurricane Irma. Other collections of cash and other cash activity, net, increased by $1.6 million.\nDirect cash flows from operations for 2018, 2017 and 2016 are presented below:\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Direct Operating Cash Flows\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collections from customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 694.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 507.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 464.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other collections of cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Disbursements to suppliers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (430.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (312.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (277.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel related disbursements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (159.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (134.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (125.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt service costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax payments, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash received from Cardinal under the SA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other cash activity, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 100.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 49.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe majority of other collections of cash are from scrap aluminum sales.\nDay's sales outstanding (DSO), which we calculate as accounts receivable divided by average daily sales, was 40 days on December 29, 2018, compared to 38 days on December 30, 2017, and 33 days on December 31, 2016.\nInventory on hand as of December 29, 2018, was $44.7 million, an increase of $6.9 million from December 30, 2017. The increase was due primarily to the acquisition of WWS. Inventory on hand as of December 29, 2018 includes $13.7 million relating to the WWS Acquisition. Excluding the inventory of WWS, the decrease in inventory includes a decrease of $5.6 million relating to the adoption of ASU 2014-09, which resulted in our recognizing revenue and, therefore, cost of sales, on inventory that was previously considered to be finished goods and work-in-process. Inventory on hand as of December 30, 2017, was $37.8 million, an increase of $7.3 million from January 2, 2016. The increase was due primarily to our decision to hold higher levels of raw materials as we continued to respond to the increase in demand for our products in the fourth quarter of 2017, which has carried over into the first quarter of 2018.\nOur inventory consists principally of raw materials purchased for the manufacture of our products and limited finished goods inventory as the majority of our products are custom, made-to-order products. Our inventory levels are more closely aligned with our number of product offerings rather than our level of sales. We have maintained our inventory level to have (i) raw materials required to support new product launches; (ii) a sufficient level of safety stock on certain items to ensure an adequate supply of material in the event of a sudden increase in demand and given our short lead-times; and (iii) adequate lead times for raw materials purchased from overseas suppliers in bulk supply. Inventory turns for the year ended December 29, 2018, was 11.0 times, slightly higher than 10.3 times for the year ended December 30, 2017. This reflects our improved performance during 2018, as well as improvements in inventory management. Inventory turns for the year ended December 30, 2017, was 10.3 times, which decreased from 11.9 times for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in turns reflects an increase in average inventory in 2017 due to several large projects.\nManagement monitors and evaluates raw material inventory levels based on the need for each discrete item to fulfill short-term requirements calculated from current order patterns and to provide appropriate safety stock. Because the majority of our products are made-to-order, we have only a small amount of finished goods and work in progress inventory. Due to these factors, we believe our inventories are not excessive, and we expect the value of such inventories will be realized.\nInvesting activities. Cash used in investing activities was $378.4 million in 2018, compared to $14.7 million in 2017, an increase in cash used of $363.7 million. We used $354.6 million of cash to acquire businesses in 2018, whereas in 2017 we had no acquisitions. Also, in 2018, we used cash of $29.8 million for capital expenditures, compared to $17.8 million in 2017, an increase of $12.0 million in cash used. Finally, in 2018, we received proceeds of $6.0 million from the sales of property, plant and equipment, an increase of $2.9 million in cash used and was almost entirely composed of cash received from Cardinal under the terms of the APA, pursuant to which we sold certain door glass manufacturing assets to Cardinal.\nCash used in investing activities was $14.7 million in 2017, compared to $119.0 million in 2016, a decrease in cash used of $104.3 million. We used $101.3 million of cash to acquire businesses in 2016, whereas in 2017 we had no acquisitions. Also, in 2017, we used cash of $17.8 million for capital expenditures, compared to $17.7 million in 2016, an increase of $0.1 million in cash used. Finally, in 2017, we received proceeds of $3.1 million from the sales of property, plant and equipment, which includes $3.0 million in\n- 29 -\ncash proceeds received from Cardinal in November 2017 relating to the terms of the APA, pursuant to which we sold certain door glass manufacturing assets to Cardinal. Cash proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment in 2016 were insignificant.\nFinancing activities. Cash provided by financing activities was $296.7 million in 2018, compared with cash used of $39.5 million in 2017, an increase in cash provided of $336.2 million. In 2018, we issued the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026, which provided proceeds of $315.0 million. Also, in 2018, we issued Company common stock in the 2018 Equity Issuance, which provided net proceeds of $152.5 million. Using primarily the proceeds from the 2018 Equity Issuance, we made repayments of long-term debt of nearly $160.3 million, compared to $40.1 million in 2017.\nThere were payments of financing costs totaling $12.1 million in 2018, related to both the Second Amendment and the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026. Taxes paid relating to common stock withheld from employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards were $0.7 million in 2018, versus $0.3 million in 2017, an increase in cash used of $0.4 million. Proceeds from the exercises of stock options were $2.2 million in 2018, compared to $0.9 million in 2017, an increase in cash provided of $1.3 million.\nCash used by financing activities was $39.5 million in 2017, compared with cash provided of $50.3 million in 2016, a decrease in cash provided of $89.8 million. Cash used for repayments of long-term debt in 2017 was $40.1 million, including voluntary prepayments of borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 totaling $40.0 million made during 2017, compared to $203.5 million in 2016, a decrease in cash used of $163.4 million. The February 2016 refinancing resulted in $261.0 million in net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt. In addition, we made payments of financing costs of $7.2 million related to the 2016 refinancing. Purchases of treasury stock were $0.3 million in 2017, versus $2.8 million in 2016, a decrease in cash used of $2.5 million. Proceeds from the exercises of stock options were nearly $0.1 million lower, and there was a decrease in excess tax benefits from option exercises of $1.9 million as a result of our adoption of ASU 2016-09, which eliminated the offsetting classifications of excess tax benefits as both operating and financing cash flows.\nCapital Expenditures. Capital expenditures vary depending on prevailing business factors, including current and anticipated market conditions. In 2018, we continued to invest in our long-term future by spending $29.8 million for capital expenditures, primarily representing equipment purchases and facility improvements to support growth. In 2017, capital expenditures were $17.8 million, primarily representing equipment purchases for the various glass processing lines in our glass processing facility. Management expects to spend between $32 million and $38 million for capital expenditures in 2019. Our capital expenditure program is geared towards making investments in capital assets targeted at increasing both gross sales and margins, but also includes capital expenditures for maintenance capital.\nCapital Resources and Debt Covenants\n2018 Equity Issuance\nOn September 18, 2018, we completed an underwritten, public offering of 7,000,000 shares of our common stock, at a public offering price of $23.00 per share.\nThe offering resulted in gross proceeds to the Company of $161.0 million. Net of an underwriting fee of $1.15 per share, net cash proceeds to the Company approximated $153.0 million. We used $152.0 million of these proceeds to prepay borrowings outstanding under the term loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022. The remainder of the proceeds were used for working capital or general corporate purposes, including payment of offering expenses of approximately $447 thousand, classified as a reduction of additional paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 29, 2018.\n2018 Senior Notes Due 2026\nOn August 10, 2018, we completed the issuance of $315.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% senior notes ( 2018 Senior Notes Due 2026\u201d), issued at 100% of their principal amount. The 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 are jointly and severally and fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of the Company's existing and future restricted subsidiaries, other than any restricted subsidiary of the Company that does not guarantee the existing senior secured credit facilities or any permitted refinancing thereof. The 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and the guarantors, respectively, and rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior debt and senior to all existing and future subordinated debt of the Company and the guarantors. The 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 were offered under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, and in transactions outside the United States under Regulation S of the Securities Act, and have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act.\nThe 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 mature on August 10, 2026. Interest on the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 is payable semi-annually, in arrears, beginning on February 16, 2019, with interest accruing at a rate of 6.75% per annum from August 10, 2018. We incurred financing costs relating to bank fees and professional services costs relating to the offering and issuance of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 totaling $10.4 million, which is being amortized under the effective interest method. See Deferred Financing Costs\u201d below. As of December 29, 2018, the face value of debt outstanding under the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 was $315.0 million, and accrued interest totaled $8.3 million.\n- 30 -\nThe indenture for the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 gives us the ability to optionally redeem some or all of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 at the redemption prices and on the terms specified in the indenture governing the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026. The indenture governing the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 does not require us to make any mandatory redemptions or sinking fund payments. However, upon the occurrence of a change of control, as defined in the indenture, the Company is required to offer to repurchase the notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.\nThe indenture for the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 includes certain covenants limiting the ability of the Company and any guarantors to, (i) incur additional indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of capital stock or make certain other restricted payments or investments; (iii) enter into agreements that restrict distributions from restricted subsidiaries; (iv) sell or otherwise dispose of assets; (v) enter into transactions with affiliates; (vi) create or incur liens; merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of the Company's assets; (vii) place restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to the Company; and (viii) designate the Company's subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications.\n2016 Credit Agreement Due 2022\nOn February 16, 2016, we entered into the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, among us, the lending institutions identified in the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, and SunTrust Bank, as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent. The 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 establishes new senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate amount of $310.0 million, consisting of a $270.0 million Term B term loan facility maturing in February 2022 that amortizes on a basis of 1% annually during its six-year term, and a $40.0 million revolving credit facility maturing in February 2021 that includes a swing line facility and a letter of credit facility. Our obligations under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 subject to exceptions, guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries that are restricted subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our assets as well as our direct and indirect restricted subsidiaries' assets.\nOn March 16, 2018, we entered into an amendment of our 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022. The Second Amendment, among other things, decreases the applicable interest rate margins for the Initial Term Loans (as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022) from (i) 3.75% to 2.50%, in the case of the Base Rate Loans (as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022), and (ii) 4.75% to 3.50%, in the case of the Eurodollar Loans (as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022). On February 17, 2017, we entered into the first amendment to our 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, which also resulted in decreases in the applicable margins, but which did not include any changes in lender positions.\nIn connection with the Second Amendment, certain existing lenders changed their positions in or exited the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, which resulted in the write-offs of portions of the deferred financing costs and original issue discount allocated to these lenders. Additionally, at the time of the issuance of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026, certain existing lenders reduced their positions in the revolving credit portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, which resulted in the write-offs of the deferred financing costs allocated to these lenders. As such, write-offs totaling $3.4 million is classified as debt extinguishment costs in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 29, 2018.\nRegarding the first amendment as described above, as there were no changes in lender positions, this action did not result in any modifications or extinguishments of debt. Therefore, there was no charge for debt extinguishment costs in the year ended December 30, 2017.\nInterest on all loans under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 is payable either quarterly or at the expiration of any LIBOR interest period applicable thereto. Prior to amending the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 on March 16, 2018, as described above, borrowings under the term loans and the revolving credit facility accrued interest at a rate equal to, at our option, LIBOR (with a floor of 100 basis points in respect of the term loan), or a base rate (with a floor of 200 basis points in respect of the term loan) plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin was 475 basis points in the case of LIBOR and 375 basis points in the case of the base rate. The weighted average all-in interest rate for borrowings under the term-loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 was 5.84% as of December 29, 2018 and was 6.21% at December 30, 2017.\nWe also pay quarterly fees on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility equal to 50 basis points per annum as well as a quarterly letter of credit fee at 575 basis points per annum plus a 12.5 basis-point facing fee per annum on the face amount of any outstanding letters of credit. As of December 29, 2018, there were $1.1 million of letters of credit outstanding and $38.9 million available under the revolver.\nThe 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 contains a springing financial covenant that would apply if we draw in excess of twenty percent (20%) of the revolving facility commitment (excluding $7.5 million of undrawn letters of credit and letters of credit and draws thereunder that are cash collateralized at 105% of the stated amount thereof from such availability test). To the extent in effect, the springing financial covenant would prohibit us from exceeding a maximum first lien net leverage ratio (based on the ratio of total first\n- 31 -\nlien (less unrestricted cash) debt to EBITDA) as of the last day of each applicable fiscal quarter. To the extent the springing financial covenant is in effect, the first lien net leverage ratio cannot exceed 4.25:1.00 as of the last day of the fiscal quarter ending on December 29, 2018 and 4.00:1.00 on the last date of each fiscal quarter ending thereafter. We were not required to test our first lien net leverage ratio for the quarter ending December 29, 2018 because we did not exceed 20% of our revolving capacity.\nThe 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 also contains a number of affirmative and restrictive covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of additional debt, liens on property, acquisitions and investments, loans and guarantees, mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions, asset sales, dividends and other payments in respect of our capital stock, entry into restrictive agreements, prepayments of certain debt and transactions with affiliates, in each case, subject to exceptions and qualifications. The 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 also contains customary events of default. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the amounts outstanding under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 may be accelerated and may become immediately due and payable. As of December 29, 2018, we were in compliance with all affirmative and restrictive covenants.\nOn September 18, 2018, contemporaneously with the 2018 Equity Issuance, we prepaid $152.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the term loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022. On December 19, 2018, we voluntarily prepaid an additional $8.0 million in borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022. As of December 29, 2018, the principal amount of debt outstanding under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 was $64.0 million, and accrued interest was $0.4 million. Interest expense, net, in the consolidated statement of operations in the year ended December 29, 2018 includes $5.6 million of accelerated amortization of lenders fees and discount relating to the prepayment of $152.0 million and $8.0 million of borrowings under the term loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 we made.\nDeferred Financing Costs\nThe activity relating to third-party fees and costs, lender fees and discount for the year ended December 29, 2018, are as follows. All debt-related fees, costs and original issue discount are classified as a reduction of the carrying value of long-term debt:\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> At beginning of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Amortization expense relating to 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,861\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add: Second amendment of 2016 Credit Agreement refinancing costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Debt extinguishment costs relating to second amendment and revolver repositioning\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,375\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add: 2018 Senior Notes deferred financing costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Amortization expense relating to 2018 Senior Notes due 2026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (372\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Accelerated amortization relating to prepayment under the 2016 Credit\nAgreement due 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,557\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> At end of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEstimated amortization expense relating to third-party fees and costs, lender fees and discount for the years indicated, as of December 29, 2018, is as follows:\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n- 32 -\nAs a result of prepayments of the term loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 totaling $204.0 million since its inception in February 2016, we have no future scheduled repayments until the maturity of the facility on February 21, 2022.

These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations.\nOn a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such difference could be material. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Item 8, Note 2. The following is a summary of our more significant accounting estimates that require the use of judgment in preparing the financial statements.\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Judgments and\nUncertainties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Effect if Actual Results Differ from\nAssumptions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Business Combinations\nWe account for business combinations in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, by applying the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method of accounting requires that we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and the noncontrolling interest, if any, at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. Goodwill is recognized as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired.\nDeferred incomes taxes, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances, if any, may be initially established in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date.\nWe continue to collect information and reevaluate these estimates and assumptions quarterly. We record any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill, provided that we are within the one-year measurement period.\nAny contingent consideration is estimated at fair value at the acquisition date. Liability-classified contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings until the contingent consideration is settled.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Significant estimates and assumptions are made by management to value such assets and liabilities based on third party valuations such as appraisals or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques. Although we believe that those estimates and assumptions are reasonable and appropriate, they are inherently uncertain and subject to change. If during the measurement period (not to exceed one year), additional information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date related to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we may adjust our estimates to account for subsequent adjustments to the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date, if any, resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the acquisition.\nOn August 13, 2018, we completed the WWS Acquisition. Headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, Western Window Systems designs and manufactures contemporary door and window systems that unify indoor/outdoor living for the residential, commercial and multi-family markets. As a result of the PA, WWS became a wholly-owned subsidiary of PGT Innovations, Inc. and its accounts and results are reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of and from August 13, 2018.\nThe fair value of consideration transferred in the WWS Acquisition was $354.6 million. At December 29, 2018, goodwill resulting from the WWS acquisition totaled $169.8 million.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Actual results can differ from our estimates, requiring adjustments to our assumptions. The result of these changes could result in a material change in our calculation and further adjustment to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Those adjustments, if occurring during the measurement period (not to exceed one year), may significantly impact the carrying value of our goodwill. Those adjustments, if occurring outside of the measurement period, may significantly impact our results of operations.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n- 35 -\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td> Indefinite Lived Intangibles\nThe impairment evaluation of the carrying amount of intangible assets with indefinite lives (which for us is our\ntrade names) is conducted annually, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. We have the option of performing a qualitative assessment of impairment to determine whether any further quantitative testing for impairment is necessary. If we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if we determine, based on qualitative factors, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our trade names is less than the carrying amount, an evaluation is performed by comparing the carrying amount of these assets to their estimated fair values. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the intangible asset, then an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value is determined using the relief from royalty method that is based upon the discounted projected cost savings (value) attributable to ownership of our trade names, our only indefinite lived intangible assets.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> In estimating fair value, the method we use requires us to make assumptions, the most material of which are sales projections attributable to products sold with these trade names, the anticipated royalty rate we would pay if the trade names were not owned (as a percent of sales), and a weighted average discount rate. These assumptions are subject to change based on changes in the markets in which these products are sold, which impact our projections of future sales and the assumed royalty rate. Factors affecting the weighted average discount rate include assumed debt to equity ratios, risk-free interest rates and equity returns, each for market participants in our industry.\nWe completed a qualitative assessment of our PGT trade name on the first day of our fourth quarter of 2018. This qualitative assessment included an evaluation of relevant events and circumstances that existed at the date of our assessment. Those events and circumstances included conditions specific to our PGT trade name, such as the inputs that would be used to calculate their fair values, as well as events and circumstances related to the PGT trade name, such as the industry in which we use the PGT trade name, our competitive environment, the availability and costs of its raw materials and labor, the financial performance of our Company, and factors related to the markets in which our Company operates. We also considered that, for our PGT trade name, no new impairment indicators were identified since the date of our prior assessment, which was a quantitative assessment. Based on that assessment, we concluded that it is more likely than not that our PGT trade name is not impaired.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Actual results can differ from our estimates, requiring adjustments to our assumptions. The result of these changes could result in a material change in our calculation and an impairment of our trade names.\nIf our WinDoor brand does not perform to the levels expected in this most recent quantitative assessment of fair value, the WinDoor trade name is at a higher degree of risk for future impairment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n- 36 -\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> In evaluating our CGI trade name, no new impairment indicators were identified since the date of our prior assessment, which was a qualitative assessment. However, in January 2019, consistent with management's plan for CGI's Estate Collection of products, we began the process of rebranding our Estate Collection as WinDoor-branded products. This rebranding aligns the Estate Collection's status as a high-end, luxury product line, with WinDoor's focus on the luxury market. We anticipate completion of this rebranding in the first half of 2020. We considered this rebranding of CGI's Estate Collection of products as WinDoor-branded products as a triggering event as it results in a\nshift in revenues from being sold under the CGI trade name, to being sold under the WinDoor trade name, requiring the CGI trade name to undergo a quantitative\nassessment.\nIn evaluating our WinDoor trade name, we performed a quantitative assessment, which included the impact of the above-described rebranding of CGI's Estate Collection of products as WinDoor-branded products.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nLeases\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842)\u201d, which requires lessees to recognize leases on-balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 was subsequently amended by ASU 2018-01, Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842\u201d; ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases\u201d; and ASU 2018-11, Targeted Improvements\u201d. The new standard requires a lessee to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the income statement.\nThe new standard is effective for us on December 30, 2018 (the first day of our 2019 fiscal year), with early adoption permitted. We expect to adopt the new standard on its effective date. A modified retrospective transition approach is required, applying the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application. An entity may choose to use either (1) its effective date, or (2) the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements as its date of initial application. We expect to adopt the new standard on December 30, 2018 and use the effective date as our date of initial application. Consequently, financial information will not be updated, and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for dates and periods prior to December 30, 2018. The new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. We expect to elect the \u2018package of practical expedients', which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and direct costs. We do not expect to elect the use-of-hindsight of the practical expedient pertaining to land easements; the later not being applicable to us.\nThe new standard also provides practical expedients for an entity's ongoing accounting. We currently expect to elect the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify, primarily our vehicle and office equipment leases. This means, for those leases that qualify, we will not recognize right-of-use assets or lease liabilities, and this includes not recognizing right-of-use assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases of those assets in transition. We also currently expect to elect the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of our leases.\nWe expect that this standard will have a material effect on our financial position. While we continue to assess all of the effects of adoption, we currently believe the most significant effects relate to the recognition of new right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on our balance sheet for our real estate operating leases and providing significant new disclosures about our leasing activities. We do not expect a significant change in our leasing activities between now and adoption. On adoption, we currently expect to recognize additional operating liabilities of between $30 million and $37 million, with corresponding right-of-use assets of the same amount based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments under current leasing standards for existing operating leases.\nFair Value Measurement Disclosures\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) - Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement\u201d. The new guidance modifies disclosure requirements related to fair value measurement. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Implementation on a prospective or retrospective basis varies by specific disclosure requirement. Early adoption is permitted. The standard also allows for early adoption of any removed or modified disclosures upon issuance of this ASU while delaying adoption of the additional disclosures until their effective date. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its fair value disclosures.\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\u201d ASU 2016-13 requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for most financial assets held at the reporting date based on an expected loss model which includes historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Entities will now use forward-looking information to better form their credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 also\n- 37 -\nrequires enhanced disclosures to help financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an entity's portfolio. Subsequently, in November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses\u201d. ASU 2018-19 clarifies the codification and corrects unintended application of the guidance. ASU's 2016-13 and 2018-19 are effective for us for our fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently assessing the impact that adopting these new standards updates will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nFORWARD OUTLOOK\nNet sales\nLooking ahead into 2019, we believe Florida's economic factors that impact our business currently are stable. Single-family housing starts in 2018 grew approximately 10% but are still below what we believe the Florida market can support. However, homebuilder confidence indices ended the year on a down note, although they are still at levels significantly higher than the era of the housing downturn. But concerns over housing affordability have impacted confidence going into 2019, especially relating to sales of single-family homes. The housing market is being impacted by a combination of higher mortgage rates, as well as land and labor shortages, which have led to tight inventories. Yet housing is still getting support from a strong job market, tax cuts, and improving household finances. On a regional basis, homebuilder confidence was down only slightly, and remained steady in the west, indications that our major markets may remain stable in 2019. However, we do not expect to repeat in 2019, the significant level of sales growth we experienced in 2018.\nWe expect 2019 full-year sales to range between $775 million and $800 million, representing an increase of between 11% and 15%, as compared to 2018, and includes an estimated range for the first quarter of 2019 of between $174 million and $179 million. A significant portion of the growth in revenues for 2019, compared to 2018, will reflect the inclusion of WWS's results for the entire year of 2019, versus only the post-acquisition period in 2018. We are targeting adjusted net income per diluted share in 2019 of between $0.93 to $1.05, which assumes approximately 59 million weighted-average diluted shares outstanding.\nGross profit and gross margin\nWe believe the following factors, which are not all inclusive, may impact our gross profit and gross margin in 2019:\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Our gross margin percentages are influenced by total sales due to operating leverage of fixed costs, and also by product mix. While we expect to continue to grow revenues organically, as mentioned above, we expect a significant portion of our revenue growth in 2019 to come from the WWS Acquisition being included in our results for the entire year of 2019, versus only the post-acquisition period in 2018. In general, products of WWS have slightly higher gross margins that PGTI's legacy brands.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> During 2018, our gross profit and gross margin percentage increased in part due to lower scrap rates and higher efficiencies due to improved operating performance. Our focus in 2019 will be to continue to sustain and strive to further improve our scrap rate performance and operating efficiencies, to further improve our margins.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> In 2017, we entered into the SA with Cardinal Glass Industries under which Cardinal supplies to us glass components for our PGT-branded doors. This arrangement has allowed us to, among other things, leverage Cardinal's industry-leading capabilities and quality-control and enable us to focus on our core area of window and door manufacturing, which has resulted in improved quality of our products and lower manufacturing rework and warranty costs, thereby contributing to improved margins during 2018, which we expect will continue during 2019. We will continue to focus on further improving on the quality of our products, which we expect should further reduce our rework and warranty costs, further benefitting gross margin.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Aluminum prices, which can fluctuate significantly, increased during the first half of 2018, then decreased through the remainder of the year. We believe that the fluctuations in aluminum prices are in some part affected by the current Presidential Administration's policies towards imports of steel and aluminum, including the potential for the imposition of additional tariffs on such products entering the United States. We believe the uncertainty surrounding the potential for these actions has and may continue to cause increasing or decreasing fluctuations in aluminum prices during 2019, and such fluctuations may be significant. As of the beginning of 2019, we are currently are covered through hedging arrangements for approximately 75 percent of our estimated aluminum requirements through the end of 2019, at an average price of $0.96 per pound, which excludes the Midwest Premium charge for delivery. The current delivered cash price is approximately $0.86 per pound.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Our gross profit and gross margin are also influenced by costs of labor. Portions of our labor force have become more tenured and, therefore, labor costs have begun to normalize as efficiencies are achieved. However, the strong jobs environment in Florida has resulted in a contraction in the labor pool, which has caused construction labor market pressure on the Company. We expect the tight construction labor market to continue during 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n- 38 -\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A)\nThis expense category will be affected by the inclusion of the SG&A of WWS for the entire year of 2019, versus the post-acquisition period in 2018. SG&A of WWS included in our 2018 results for the post-acquisition period were approximately $19.5 million. SG&A expenses of WWS in 2019 will include approximately $9.4 million in non-cash amortization expense, compared to $3.6 million in 2018. We also expect our SG&A expenses to be impacted by the continuation of increased advertising spending in 2019. We expect to leverage fixed SG&A on anticipated higher sales in 2019, compared to 2018, and to continue to look for areas within SG&A to drive more efficiencies.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nWe expect depreciation and amortization will be approximately $36.0 million in 2019.\nInterest expense\nDuring 2018, we made significant prepayments of borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, using proceeds from the 2018 Equity Issuance, as well as from cash on hand. These prepayments will result in a lower level of debt service under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022. However, with the issuance of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026, the level of our debt outstanding increased by $315.0 million, at a fixed interest rate of 6.75%. We believe interest expense on our long-term debt will be approximately $27.0 million in 2019, including an estimated $1.8 million of non-cash amortization of deferred financing costs.\nIncome tax expense\nWe expect to continue to be profitable in 2019, and thus, that we will incur income tax expense at a combined Federal and state effective rate of between approximately 26% to 27%. This rate is based on the lower overall corporate income tax rate of 21% as the result of the Tax Act, plus a blended statutory state rate, taking into consideration the effect on our state rate due to our recent acquisition of WWS.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nWe had $52.7 million of cash on hand as of December 29, 2018. During 2019, we expect to continue to generate sufficient cash from operations to service the interest requirements on our debt, cover our operating expenses, and spend between $32 million and $38 million for capital expenditures. Because of the prepayments of borrowings totaling $204.0 million we have made since the inception of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, we have no further mandatory required payments remaining until the maturity of the facility in February, 2022 but may continue to make voluntary prepayments in the future as our cash generation and other relevant factors permit. However, no assurances can be given that cash from operations will be sufficient for some or all these purposes.\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "Interest expense was $20.3 million in 2017, an increase of $0.2 million from $20.1 million in the prior year. During 2017, we made a total of $40 million voluntary prepayments of borrowings under our 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, which resulted in non-cash write-offs of deferred lenders fees and discount of $1.9 million, classified as interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 30, 2017. These charges offset the savings generated over prior year from our debt repricing we completed in February 2017, which resulted in a one percentage-point decrease in the margin portion of the interest rate, and lower debt levels from previous prepayments. Additionally, we saw increases in LIBOR during 2017, which increased the weighted average interest rate we paid during 2017 since the beginning of the year.\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

The increase was due primarily to our decision to hold higher levels of raw materials as we continued to respond to the increase in demand for our products in the fourth quarter of 2017, which has carried over into the first quarter of 2018.\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 315,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 379,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n- 26 -\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Current\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt - 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 75,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 64,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt - 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 479,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 371,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Aluminum forward contracts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Supply agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equipment purchase commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 615,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 62,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 115,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 389,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe APA provided for the transfer of the assets from the Company to Cardinal in two phases, with the first date in 2017, and the second date in 2018, on dates which the Company and Cardinal agree to use.

This increase in collections was partially offset by an increase in payments to suppliers of $34.6 million as the result of higher procurements of inventory due to increased sales, an increase in personnel related disbursements of $8.8 million due to the higher level of employees during 2017, compared to 2016 to support the increase in demand for our products, and an increase in debt service costs of $0.3 million, primarily as the result of an increase in LIBOR during 2017, partially offset by lower debt levels from voluntary debt prepayments made during 2017, and a one percentage-point decrease in our margin from the February 2017 refinancing. Also, in 2017 compared to last year, net tax payments decreased $2.2 million, A federal and state income tax liability of $6.5 million was included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying\nGross profit was $243.5 million in 2018, an increase of $84.5 million, or 53.1%, from $159.0 million in the prior year. The gross margin percentage was 34.9% in 2018, compared to 31.1% in the prior year, a percentage-point increase of 3.8%. Adjusting for costs relating to machinery and equipment relocations, as well as an opening balance sheet inventory adjustment relating to our acquisition of WWS, for a total of $1.2 million in 2018, and adjusting for costs relating to Hurricane Irma, WinDoor leadership and glass supply-chain transition costs, and costs relating to the start-up of our Thermal Plastic Spacer system line incurred in January and February, totaling $2.1 million in 2017, the gross margin percentage was 35.0% in 2018, compared to 31.5% in 2017, a percentage-point increase of 3.5%. There were improvements in 2018, compared to last year, relating to higher contribution margins on the increased sales volume, which benefitted gross margin by 1.2%, price increases, which benefitted gross margin by 1.5%, in scrap rates and efficiencies, which benefitted gross margin by 1.0%, a change in mix towards a higher portion of repair and remodeling sales, which benefitted gross margin by 0.7%. These increases were partially offset by decreases due to higher overall material prices, which decreased gross margin by 1.1%, and which included higher aluminum prices compared to last year, partially offset by lower glass costs as a result of our supply agreement with Cardinal Glass Industries, and by higher overhead costs, which decreased gross margin by 1.2%. The addition of WWS benefitted gross margin by 1.4%.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for 2017 were $98.8 million, an increase of $14.8 million, or 17.6%, from $84.0 million in the prior year. As a percentage of net sales, these costs were 19.3% in 2017, an increase of 1.0% from 18.3% in 2016. Contributing to the increase was a $2.5 million increase in selling and distribution costs as the result of an increase in volume, and due to distribution disruptions caused by Hurricane Irma, as well as increased spending for advertising following Hurricane Irma. There were also increases in personnel-related costs of $6.6 million primarily due to higher accrued incentive costs as a result of the Company's improved performance. Also contributing to the increase were $1.0 million of costs from our attendance at and participation in the National Association of Home Builders' International Builders Show in Orlando, Florida in January 2017, $0.9 million in higher depreciation expense on higher recent capital spending, and due to higher bank credit card fees of $0.6 million due to higher credit card collections. Selling, general and administrative expenses also increased due to costs relating to our community outreach activities which we undertook to assist those affected by Hurricane Irma. The remaining increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is related to an increase in the level of administrative activities.\n2018 Equity Issuance\nGross profit and gross margin\nNet sales\nLong-term debt consists of the following:\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n- 22 -\nNet sales of our impact window and door products, which include our PGT WinGuard products, as well as all of CGI's products and the substantial majority of WinDoor's products, were $433.4 million in 2017, an increase of $51.8 million, or 13.6%, driven by an increase in sales of our WinGuard products, primarily our vinyl WinGuard products. Included in sales of our impact-resistant window and door products for 2017 were $304.4 million of aluminum impact sales, an increase of $26.5 million, or 9.5%, and $129.0 million of vinyl impact sales, an increase of $25.3 million, or 24.4%.\nInterest expense\nDeferred Financing Costs\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDuring 2018, we executed on two major capital transactions: (1) the issuance of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026; and (2) the 2018 Equity Issuance. The transactions provided substantial liquidity, the proceeds from which were used to acquire WWS, in the case of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 and used to make a prepayment of borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, in the case of the 2018 Equity Issuance. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for a more detailed discussion of these events.\nOur principal source of liquidity is cash flow generated by operations, supplemented by borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, if ever needed. Our cash generating capability provides us with financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs. Our primary capital requirements are to fund working capital needs, and to meet required debt payments, including debt service payments on borrowings and fund capital expenditures.\nInterest expense\nOperating activities. Cash provided by operating activities was $100.3 million for 2018, compared to $49.0 million for 2017, and compared to $46.4 million for 2016.\nThe following table shows net sales classified by major product category (in millions, except percentages):\nInvesting activities. Cash used in investing activities was $378.4 million in 2018, compared to $14.7 million in 2017, an increase in cash used of $363.7 million. We used $354.6 million of cash to acquire businesses in 2018, whereas in 2017 we had no acquisitions. Also, in 2018, we used cash of $29.8 million for capital expenditures, compared to $17.8 million in 2017, an increase of $12.0 million in cash used. Finally, in 2018, we received proceeds of $6.0 million from the sales of property, plant and equipment, an increase of $2.9 million in cash used and was almost entirely composed of cash received from Cardinal under the terms of the APA, pursuant to which we sold certain door glass manufacturing assets to Cardinal.\nFORWARD OUTLOOK\nThe 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 contains a springing financial covenant that would apply if we draw in excess of twenty percent (20%) of the revolving facility commitment (excluding $7.5 million of undrawn letters of credit and letters of credit and draws thereunder that are cash collateralized at 105% of the stated amount thereof from such availability test). To the extent in effect, the springing financial covenant would prohibit us from exceeding a maximum first lien net leverage ratio (based on the ratio of total first\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 29, 2018 (in thousands):\n- 30 -\nAs a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted effective on December 22, 2017, our Federal corporate income tax rate has been reduced from 35%, to 21%. This reduction in rate has lowered our overall effective tax rate. Additionally, the section 199 domestic manufacturing deduction was repealed. As such, our effective tax rate, excluding the discrete items discussed above, approximates our current combined statutory federal and state rate of approximately 25.5% for 2018. In 2017, the effective tax rate, excluding the effect of the discrete item discussed above, was lower than our then combined statutory federal and state tax rate of 38.8% primarily as the result of the estimated impact of the section 199 domestic manufacturing deduction.\n- 35 -\n- 23 -\n\nItem 7.\n \u2022 Recently Issued Accounting Standards; and \n (1) Includes estimated future interest expense on our term debt under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 at a weighted-average interest rate of 5.84% as of December 29, 2018, which includes a weighted-average base rate of 2.28% and a margin of 3.50%. \nlien (less unrestricted cash) debt to EBITDA) as of the last day of each applicable fiscal quarter. To the extent the springing financial covenant is in effect, the first lien net leverage ratio cannot exceed 4.25:1.00 as of the last day of the fiscal quarter ending on December 29, 2018 and 4.00:1.00 on the last date of each fiscal quarter ending thereafter. We were not required to test our first lien net leverage ratio for the quarter ending December 29, 2018 because we did not exceed 20% of our revolving capacity.\nWe also pay quarterly fees on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility equal to 50 basis points per annum as well as a quarterly letter of credit fee at 575 basis points per annum plus a 12.5 basis-point facing fee per annum on the face amount of any outstanding letters of credit. As of December 29, 2018, there were $1.1 million of letters of credit outstanding and $38.9 million available under the revolver.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act\u201d). The Tax Act includes significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system, including a Federal corporate rate reduction from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation, the elimination of the Section 199 domestic production activities deduction, and further restricting the deductibility of certain already restricted expenses.\nThe activity relating to third-party fees and costs, lender fees and discount for the year ended December 29, 2018, are as follows. All debt-related fees, costs and original issue discount are classified as a reduction of the carrying value of long-term debt:\nLeases\nCash used by financing activities was $39.5 million in 2017, compared with cash provided of $50.3 million in 2016, a decrease in cash provided of $89.8 million. Cash used for repayments of long-term debt in 2017 was $40.1 million, including voluntary prepayments of borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 totaling $40.0 million made during 2017, compared to $203.5 million in 2016, a decrease in cash used of $163.4 million. The February 2016 refinancing resulted in $261.0 million in net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt. In addition, we made payments of financing costs of $7.2 million related to the 2016 refinancing. Purchases of treasury stock were $0.3 million in 2017, versus $2.8 million in 2016, a decrease in cash used of $2.5 million. Proceeds from the exercises of stock options were nearly $0.1 million lower, and there was a decrease in excess tax benefits from option exercises of $1.9 million as a result of our adoption of ASU 2016-09, which eliminated the offsetting classifications of excess tax benefits as both operating and financing cash flows.\nIncome tax expense\n$5.8 million. We recognized gains on disposals for the difference totaling $2.6 million during the year ended December 29, 2018, classified as a separate line item in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 29, 2018.\nWe expect depreciation and amortization will be approximately $36.0 million in 2019.\n \u2022 Disclosures of Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments; \nGross profit was $243.5 million for our 2018 fiscal year, which increased 53.1% when compared to 2017. Our gross profit increased primarily due to higher sales volume, but also benefitted from price increases in 2018, as well as improvements in operational performance, which generated increased efficiencies, and a decrease in scrap rates. Our gross profit also benefitted from product mix. However, inflationary conditions persisted through all of 2018, including in the cost of aluminum, after increasing significantly during the second half of 2017, remained high during the first half of 2018, but then has subsided through the end of 2018. For example, the per-pound market cash price of aluminum, not including the Midwest Premium charge for delivery, began the year at $1.11, but has decreased to $0.85 at the end of the year, and is approximately $0.83 in mid-February 2019. We increased prices for our products during 2018 to cover these cost increases, but in the future, we may not always be able to offset cost increases we incur by increasing our selling prices.\n \u2022 Forward Outlook \nEffective on February 17, 2017, we repriced and amended our 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 for the first time. As there were no changes in lender positions, this action did not result in any modifications or extinguishments of debt. Therefore, there was no charge for debt extinguishment costs in 2017.\n\nInterest expense was $26.5 million in 2018, an increase of $6.2 million from $20.3 million in the prior year. Interest expense in 2018 includes $5.6 million of accelerated amortization of lenders fees and discount relating to the prepayment of $152.0 million of borrowings under the term loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 we made on September 18, 2018 and the voluntary prepayment of $8.0 million we made on December 19, 2018. Excluding this amount, the decrease in interest expense due to a decrease in the average level of outstanding borrowings under the term loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 as the result of the prepayments made during 2018 and 2017, were offset by interest expense from the issuance of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026, composed of $315.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% unsecured senior notes due 2026. The 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 carry a higher per-annum interest rate and have a higher principal amount outstanding than borrowings under the term loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022.\nAnalysis of Selected Items from our Consolidated Statements of Operations\nDay's sales outstanding (DSO), which we calculate as accounts receivable divided by average daily sales, was 40 days on December 29, 2018, compared to 38 days on December 30, 2017, and 33 days on December 31, 2016.\nThe new standard also provides practical expedients for an entity's ongoing accounting. We currently expect to elect the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify, primarily our vehicle and office equipment leases. This means, for those leases that qualify, we will not recognize right-of-use assets or lease liabilities, and this includes not recognizing right-of-use assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases of those assets in transition. We also currently expect to elect the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of our leases.\nThe amounts reflected in the table above for operating leases represent future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases with an initial or remaining term in excess of one year at December 29 2018. Purchase orders entered into in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table. Amounts for which we are liable are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\nGross profit and gross margin\nLooking ahead into 2019, we believe Florida's economic factors that impact our business currently are stable. Single-family housing starts in 2018 grew approximately 10% but are still below what we believe the Florida market can support. However, homebuilder confidence indices ended the year on a down note, although they are still at levels significantly higher than the era of the housing downturn. But concerns over housing affordability have impacted confidence going into 2019, especially relating to sales of single-family homes. The housing market is being impacted by a combination of higher mortgage rates, as well as land and labor shortages, which have led to tight inventories. Yet housing is still getting support from a strong job market, tax cuts, and improving household finances. On a regional basis, homebuilder confidence was down only slightly, and remained steady in the west, indications that our major markets may remain stable in 2019. However, we do not expect to repeat in 2019, the significant level of sales growth we experienced in 2018.\n \u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources; \nNet sales\nOur non-impact window and door products included $72.8 million of aluminum non-impact sales, an increase of $47.9 million, or 192.8%, and $63.9 million of vinyl non-impact sales, an increase of $11.1 million, or 21.1%. Included in sales of WWS's window and door products were $43.3 million of aluminum non-impact sales, and $6.4 million of vinyl non-impact sales.\nExcluding the effects of these discrete items in income tax expense, and certain tax credits received in each period, our effective tax rate in 2018 would have been 25.7%, compared to 36.8% in 2017.\n \u2022 Our gross margin percentages are influenced by total sales due to operating leverage of fixed costs, and also by product mix. While we expect to continue to grow revenues organically, as mentioned above, we expect a significant portion of our revenue growth in 2019 to come from the WWS Acquisition being included in our results for the entire year of 2019, versus only the post-acquisition period in 2018. In general, products of WWS have slightly higher gross margins that PGTI's legacy brands. \n- 28 -\nCardinal paid us $3.0 million in cash on November 1, 2017, $10.0 million in cash on January 16, 2018, and $14.8 million on June 8, 2018, pursuant to the APA. The total proceeds received of $27.8 million was $0.2 million less than the $28.0 million as specified in the APA as we retained certain assets that were initially identified for transfer. On December 15, 2017, machinery and equipment classified as assets held for sale with net book value of $1.5 million, and fair value of $1.9 million was transferred to Cardinal and their equipment rigger, and we recognized a gain for the difference. Substantially all of the remaining machinery and equipment was transferred to Cardinal during the second quarter of 2018, which had a net book value of $3.2 million and fair value of\n2017 Compared with 2016\nThe indenture for the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 includes certain covenants limiting the ability of the Company and any guarantors to, (i) incur additional indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of capital stock or make certain other restricted payments or investments; (iii) enter into agreements that restrict distributions from restricted subsidiaries; (iv) sell or otherwise dispose of assets; (v) enter into transactions with affiliates; (vi) create or incur liens; merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of the Company's assets; (vii) place restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to the Company; and (viii) designate the Company's subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nWe expect to continue to be profitable in 2019, and thus, that we will incur income tax expense at a combined Federal and state effective rate of between approximately 26% to 27%. This rate is based on the lower overall corporate income tax rate of 21% as the result of the Tax Act, plus a blended statutory state rate, taking into consideration the effect on our state rate due to our recent acquisition of WWS.\n\nrequires enhanced disclosures to help financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an entity's portfolio. Subsequently, in November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses\u201d. ASU 2018-19 clarifies the codification and corrects unintended application of the guidance. ASU's 2016-13 and 2018-19 are effective for us for our fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently assessing the impact that adopting these new standards updates will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nInterest expense\nFinancing activities. Cash provided by financing activities was $296.7 million in 2018, compared with cash used of $39.5 million in 2017, an increase in cash provided of $336.2 million. In 2018, we issued the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026, which provided proceeds of $315.0 million. Also, in 2018, we issued Company common stock in the 2018 Equity Issuance, which provided net proceeds of $152.5 million. Using primarily the proceeds from the 2018 Equity Issuance, we made repayments of long-term debt of nearly $160.3 million, compared to $40.1 million in 2017.\nWe had $52.7 million of cash on hand as of December 29, 2018. During 2019, we expect to continue to generate sufficient cash from operations to service the interest requirements on our debt, cover our operating expenses, and spend between $32 million and $38 million for capital expenditures. Because of the prepayments of borrowings totaling $204.0 million we have made since the inception of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, we have no further mandatory required payments remaining until the maturity of the facility in February, 2022 but may continue to make voluntary prepayments in the future as our cash generation and other relevant factors permit. However, no assurances can be given that cash from operations will be sufficient for some or all these purposes.\n- 29 -\nDebt extinguishment costs were $3.4 million in 2018. In connection with the Second Amendment, certain existing lenders changed their positions in or exited the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, which resulted in the write-offs of portions of the deferred financing costs and original issue discount allocated to these lenders. Additionally, at the time of the issuance of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026, certain existing lenders reduced their positions in the revolving credit portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, which resulted in the write-offs of the deferred financing costs allocated to these lenders. As such, write-offs totaling $3.4 million is classified as debt extinguishment costs in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 29, 2018.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) - Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement\u201d. The new guidance modifies disclosure requirements related to fair value measurement. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Implementation on a prospective or retrospective basis varies by specific disclosure requirement. Early adoption is permitted. The standard also allows for early adoption of any removed or modified disclosures upon issuance of this ASU while delaying adoption of the additional disclosures until their effective date. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its fair value disclosures.\nDebt extinguishment costs\nThe new standard is effective for us on December 30, 2018 (the first day of our 2019 fiscal year), with early adoption permitted. We expect to adopt the new standard on its effective date. A modified retrospective transition approach is required, applying the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application. An entity may choose to use either (1) its effective date, or (2) the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements as its date of initial application. We expect to adopt the new standard on December 30, 2018 and use the effective date as our date of initial application. Consequently, financial information will not be updated, and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for dates and periods prior to December 30, 2018. The new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. We expect to elect the \u2018package of practical expedients', which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and direct costs. We do not expect to elect the use-of-hindsight of the practical expedient pertaining to land easements; the later not being applicable to us.\nDirect cash flows from operations for 2018, 2017 and 2016 are presented below:\n \u2022 Sales of Door Glass Processing Assets \n (2) Includes estimated future interest expense on our 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 a fixed interest rate of 6.75% as of December 29, 2018. \nAt the time we ceased using these assets in production, at which time they became available for immediate sale, their net book value was $4.7 million, and they were reclassified from property, plant and equipment, to assets held for sale within other current assets.\n</table>\nIncome tax expense was $11.3 million for 2018, representing an effective tax rate of 17.3%. This compares to income tax expense of $63 thousand for 2017, representing an effective tax rate of 0.2%. Income tax expense in 2018, and 2017, includes excess tax benefits relating to exercises of stock options and lapses of restrictions on stock awards, treated as a discrete item of income tax, totaling $5.2 million and $1.8 million, respectively. Also, income tax expense includes a $12.4 million tax benefit in 2017 due to the revaluation of our ending net deferred tax liabilities at December 30, 2017 as the result of the Tax Act, which was reduced slightly by an adjustment of a $0.2 million tax expense in 2018.\n In evaluating our CGI trade name, no new impairment indicators were identified since the date of our prior assessment, which was a qualitative assessment. However, in January 2019, consistent with management's plan for CGI's Estate Collection of products, we began the process of rebranding our Estate Collection as WinDoor-branded products. This rebranding aligns the Estate Collection's status as a high-end, luxury product line, with WinDoor's focus on the luxury market. We anticipate completion of this rebranding in the first half of 2020. We considered this rebranding of CGI's Estate Collection of products as WinDoor-branded products as a triggering event as it results in a shift in revenues from being sold under the CGI trade name, to being sold under the WinDoor trade name, requiring the CGI trade name to undergo a quantitative assessment. In evaluating our WinDoor trade name, we performed a quantitative assessment, which included the impact of the above-described rebranding of CGI's Estate Collection of products as WinDoor-branded products. \n \u2022 During 2018, our gross profit and gross margin percentage increased in part due to lower scrap rates and higher efficiencies due to improved operating performance. Our focus in 2019 will be to continue to sustain and strive to further improve our scrap rate performance and operating efficiencies, to further improve our margins. \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n \u2022 Results of Operations; \nExcluding the effects of these discrete items in income tax expense, our effective tax rate in 2017 would have been 36.8%, compared to 36.5% in 2016, slightly lower than our combined statutory federal and state tax rate of 38.8%, primarily as the result of the section 199 domestic manufacturing deduction in both years.\nOn March 16, 2018, we entered into an amendment of our 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022. The Second Amendment, among other things, decreases the applicable interest rate margins for the Initial Term Loans (as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022) from (i) 3.75% to 2.50%, in the case of the Base Rate Loans (as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022), and (ii) 4.75% to 3.50%, in the case of the Eurodollar Loans (as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022). On February 17, 2017, we entered into the first amendment to our 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, which also resulted in decreases in the applicable margins, but which did not include any changes in lender positions.\n\nRegarding the first amendment as described above, as there were no changes in lender positions, this action did not result in any modifications or extinguishments of debt. Therefore, there was no charge for debt extinguishment costs in the year ended December 30, 2017.\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the Tax Act, the Company revalued its ending net deferred tax liabilities at December 30, 2017 and recognized a $12.4 million tax benefit in the Company's consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 30, 2017. Upon the filing of our Federal and state income tax return for 2017, in the third quarter of 2018, we recognized an adjustment to this gain of $0.2 million of tax expense.\nOn September 22, 2017, we entered into the APA with Cardinal for the sale to Cardinal of certain manufacturing equipment we used in processing glass components for PGT-branded doors. Substantially all of the remaining machinery and equipment was transferred to Cardinal during the second quarter of 2018, which had a net book value of $3.2 million and fair value of $5.8 million. We recognized gains on disposals for the difference totaling $2.6 million during 2018, classified as a separate line item in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 29, 2018.\nThe offering resulted in gross proceeds to the Company of $161.0 million. Net of an underwriting fee of $1.15 per share, net cash proceeds to the Company approximated $153.0 million. We used $152.0 million of these proceeds to prepay borrowings outstanding under the term loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022. The remainder of the proceeds were used for working capital or general corporate purposes, including payment of offering expenses of approximately $447 thousand, classified as a reduction of additional paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 29, 2018.\ncash proceeds received from Cardinal in November 2017 relating to the terms of the APA, pursuant to which we sold certain door glass manufacturing assets to Cardinal. Cash proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment in 2016 were insignificant.\nAs a result of prepayments of the term loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 totaling $204.0 million since its inception in February 2016, we have no future scheduled repayments until the maturity of the facility on February 21, 2022. The contractual future maturities of long-term debt outstanding, including other debt relating to our software license financing arrangement, as of December 29, 2018, are as follows (at face value):\nThe 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 also contains a number of affirmative and restrictive covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of additional debt, liens on property, acquisitions and investments, loans and guarantees, mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions, asset sales, dividends and other payments in respect of our capital stock, entry into restrictive agreements, prepayments of certain debt and transactions with affiliates, in each case, subject to exceptions and qualifications. The 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 also contains customary events of default. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the amounts outstanding under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 may be accelerated and may become immediately due and payable. As of December 29, 2018, we were in compliance with all affirmative and restrictive covenants.\n2016 Credit Agreement Due 2022\n- 21 -\nWe record warranty costs as a selling expense within selling, general and administrative expenses. During 2018, we recorded warranty expense at a rate of 1.7% of sales, which decreased when compared to the rate in 2017 of 2.1% of sales. We believe the decrease in warranty expense as a percentage of sales was the result of our workforce becoming more seasoned through experience and training, as well as a change in our warranty profile on PGT-branded door glass components produced by Cardinal as part of the SA on which they provide the warranty coverage.\nNet sales\nexpense. Excluding these charges, interest expense increased slightly, as the savings from prepayments of borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, were more than offset by interest by the issuance of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026, which carry a fixed interest rate of 6.75%.\nGross profit was $159.0 million in 2017, an increase of $18.9 million, or 13.5%, from $140.1 million in the prior year. The gross margin percentage was 31.1% in 2017, compared to 30.6% in the prior year, a percentage-point increase of 0.5%. Adjusting for costs relating to Hurricane Irma, WinDoor leadership and glass supply-chain transition costs, and costs relating to the start-up of our Thermal Plastic Spacer system line incurred in January and February, totaling $2.1 million in 2017, and product line termination costs and costs relating to the start-up of our Thermal Plastic Spacer system line incurred totaling $1.6 million in 2016, the gross margin percentage was 31.5% in 2017, compared to 30.9% in 2016, a percentage-point increase of 0.6%. Gross margin was positively impacted by several factors, including improvements in scrap rates and production efficiencies at our PGT and CGI facilities, and a favorable change in product mix, each of which benefitted gross margin by 0.6%, from price increases announced during 2017, which benefitted gross margin by 0.5%, and a favorable impact on higher sales volume, which benefitted gross margin by 0.3%. These improvements were partially offset by decreases resulting from higher material costs, primarily due to the increase in aluminum prices during 2017, which decreased gross margin by 0.7%, higher depreciation, decreasing margin by 0.6%, and due to WinDoor, which negatively impacted gross margin by 0.1%.\n- 38 -\nSales of our non-impact window and door products were $136.7 million in 2018, an increase of $59.0 million, or 76.0%. Driving this increase are the sales of WWS, our recently acquired window and door manufacturer in the western U.S., whose products\n\nLiquidity and Cash Flow\nGross profit and gross margin\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $150.9 million for our 2018 fiscal year, which increased $52.1 million compared to 2017, which includes the SG&A of WWS of $19.5 million, as well as the related acquisition costs of $3.8 million. Higher selling and distribution costs were the main driver of this increase, which is directly related to the significant increase in sales. The second most significant factor was higher personnel-related costs, including higher incentive compensation-related costs due to our improved performance, but also relating to a higher number of employees. Also, beginning in late 2017 after Hurricane Irma, we increased our investment in advertising, and maintained higher advertising levels during 2018 to further promote, in the post-Hurricane Irma environment, the benefits of our impact-resistant products. There was also an increase in depreciation expense during 2018 that contributed to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as compared to last year.\n (3) In July 2017, we entered into a two-year financing arrangement for the purchase of an enterprise-wide software license relating to office productivity software. This financing arrangement requires 24 monthly payments of $26 thousand each. We estimated the value of this financing arrangement to be $590 thousand, using an imputed annual interest rate of 6.00%, which approximates our borrowing rate under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, a Level 3 input. \nThe indenture for the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 gives us the ability to optionally redeem some or all of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 at the redemption prices and on the terms specified in the indenture governing the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026. The indenture governing the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 does not require us to make any mandatory redemptions or sinking fund payments. However, upon the occurrence of a change of control, as defined in the indenture, the Company is required to offer to repurchase the notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.\nCash used in investing activities was $14.7 million in 2017, compared to $119.0 million in 2016, a decrease in cash used of $104.3 million. We used $101.3 million of cash to acquire businesses in 2016, whereas in 2017 we had no acquisitions. Also, in 2017, we used cash of $17.8 million for capital expenditures, compared to $17.7 million in 2016, an increase of $0.1 million in cash used. Finally, in 2017, we received proceeds of $3.1 million from the sales of property, plant and equipment, which includes $3.0 million in\nDISCLOSURES OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS\nGains on sales of assets under APA\n- 33 -\n- 27 -\nWe expect that this standard will have a material effect on our financial position. While we continue to assess all of the effects of adoption, we currently believe the most significant effects relate to the recognition of new right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on our balance sheet for our real estate operating leases and providing significant new disclosures about our leasing activities. We do not expect a significant change in our leasing activities between now and adoption. On adoption, we currently expect to recognize additional operating liabilities of between $30 million and $37 million, with corresponding right-of-use assets of the same amount based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments under current leasing standards for existing operating leases.\nOn February 16, 2016, we entered into the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, among us, the lending institutions identified in the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, and SunTrust Bank, as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent. The 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 establishes new senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate amount of $310.0 million, consisting of a $270.0 million Term B term loan facility maturing in February 2022 that amortizes on a basis of 1% annually during its six-year term, and a $40.0 million revolving credit facility maturing in February 2021 that includes a swing line facility and a letter of credit facility. Our obligations under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 subject to exceptions, guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries that are restricted subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our assets as well as our direct and indirect restricted subsidiaries' assets.\n- 34 -\nLiquidity and capital resources\n (1) Effective on August 10, 2018, the Company completed the issuance of $315.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% senior notes due August 10, 2026, issued at 100% of their principal amount. The senior notes were issued to finance, together with cash on hand, the WWS Acquisition. \nSales and Operations\nThe following table shows net sales by major product category (in millions, except percentages):\nOur sales grew to $698.5 million in our 2018 fiscal year, a 36.7% increase when compared to 2017. This increase includes sales from our August 13, 2018 acquisition of WWS, which totaled $49.7 million, but also resulted from increases in sales of our aluminum and vinyl impact-resistant products, which grew by 28.5% and 32.3%, respectively. Driving these results were increases in the sales of our flagship WinGuard impact-resistant products, including vinyl WinGuard impact-resistant products, which grew by 35.5%, and our aluminum WinGuard impact-resistant products, which grew by 26.4%, both as compared to 2017. Since 2014, our vinyl WinGuard products have grown at a compound annual rate of nearly 35%. The growth in the sales of our vinyl impact products highlights the shift in our markets towards more energy efficient products and our ability to design attractive and innovative windows and doors to meet those needs. We also believe our sales in 2018 benefitted from the heightened awareness of impact-resistant products as the result of Hurricane Irma, which hit our primary markets in mid-September 2017, and our increased advertising following Hurricane Irma. Excluding sales of WWS, our annual sales to the repair and remodel market increased by $104.4 million, or 33.6%, in 2018, as compared to 2017, while new construction sales increased $33.3 million, or 16.6%. By region, our annual sales in Florida increased $111.7 million, or 24.3%, for 2018 compared to 2017, and sales in our out-of-state markets increased $60.0 million, or 169.9%. The increase in out-of-state sales is primarily due to the inclusion of the post-acquisition sales of WWS, which are primarily in the western and southwestern U.S. The remaining increase was related to an increase in international sales.\nNet sales of our impact-resistant window and door products, which include our PGT WinGuard products, as well as all of CGI's products and the substantial majority of WinDoor's products, were $561.8 million in 2018, an increase of $128.4 million, or 29.6%, driven by an increase in sales of our WinGuard products, primarily our vinyl WinGuard products. Included in sales of our impact-resistant window and door products for 2018 were $391.1 million of aluminum impact sales, an increase of $86.7 million, or 28.5%, and $170.7 million of vinyl impact sales, an increase of $41.7 million, or 32.3%.\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses\n2018 Senior Notes Due 2026\n \u2022 Executive Overview; \n \u2022 Our gross profit and gross margin are also influenced by costs of labor. Portions of our labor force have become more tenured and, therefore, labor costs have begun to normalize as efficiencies are achieved. However, the strong jobs environment in Florida has resulted in a contraction in the labor pool, which has caused construction labor market pressure on the Company. We expect the tight construction labor market to continue during 2019. \nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>\n2018 Compared with 2017\n (2) Effective on February 17, 2017, the Company amended and repriced this term loan. Terms of the repriced facility include a one percentage-point reduction in the stated interest rate, to LIBOR of 1.00% plus a margin of 4.75%. The amended term loan facility had quarterly payments of principal of $0.675 million, with a lump sum payment of $253.8 million due February 15, 2022, each of which remained unchanged from the prior facility. Due to prepayments totaling $204.0 million since the inception of the facility, there are no required quarterly payments of principal until the maturity of the facility on February 15, 2022, at which time the remaining outstanding balance of $64.0 million is due. \nOur income tax expense was $63 thousand for 2017, representing an effective tax rate of 0.2%. This compares to income tax expense of $11.8 million for 2016, representing an effective tax rate of 33.2%. Income tax expense in 2017, includes a $12.4 million tax benefit due to the revaluation of our ending net deferred tax liabilities at December 30, 2017 as the result of the Tax Act, Income tax expense in 2017 also includes excess tax benefits totaling $1.8 million. We adopted ASU 2016-09 effective on January 1, 2017. As a result, excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options and lapse of restriction on stock awards are now recognized as a discrete item in tax expense, where previously such tax effects had been recognized in additional paid-in-capital. Income tax expense in 2017 also benefitted from tax credits totaling $0.4 million, including estimated federal income tax credits recognized related to our research and development efforts for 2017, and state incentive tax credits.\nWe are obligated to purchase certain raw materials used in the production of our products from certain suppliers pursuant to stocking programs. If all of these programs were cancelled by us, as of December 29, 2018, we would be required to pay $12.0 million for various materials.\nThis expense category will be affected by the inclusion of the SG&A of WWS for the entire year of 2019, versus the post-acquisition period in 2018. SG&A of WWS included in our 2018 results for the post-acquisition period were approximately $19.5 million. SG&A expenses of WWS in 2019 will include approximately $9.4 million in non-cash amortization expense, compared to $3.6 million in 2018. We also expect our SG&A expenses to be impacted by the continuation of increased advertising spending in 2019. We expect to leverage fixed SG&A on anticipated higher sales in 2019, compared to 2018, and to continue to look for areas within SG&A to drive more efficiencies.\n Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Business Combinations We account for business combinations in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, by applying the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method of accounting requires that we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and the noncontrolling interest, if any, at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. Goodwill is recognized as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Deferred incomes taxes, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances, if any, may be initially established in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. We continue to collect information and reevaluate these estimates and assumptions quarterly. We record any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill, provided that we are within the one-year measurement period. Any contingent consideration is estimated at fair value at the acquisition date. Liability-classified contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings until the contingent consideration is settled. Significant estimates and assumptions are made by management to value such assets and liabilities based on third party valuations such as appraisals or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques. Although we believe that those estimates and assumptions are reasonable and appropriate, they are inherently uncertain and subject to change. If during the measurement period (not to exceed one year), additional information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date related to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we may adjust our estimates to account for subsequent adjustments to the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date, if any, resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the acquisition. On August 13, 2018, we completed the WWS Acquisition. Headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, Western Window Systems designs and manufactures contemporary door and window systems that unify indoor/outdoor living for the residential, commercial and multi-family markets. As a result of the PA, WWS became a wholly-owned subsidiary of PGT Innovations, Inc. and its accounts and results are reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of and from August 13, 2018. The fair value of consideration transferred in the WWS Acquisition was $354.6 million. At December 29, 2018, goodwill resulting from the WWS acquisition totaled $169.8 million. Actual results can differ from our estimates, requiring adjustments to our assumptions. The result of these changes could result in a material change in our calculation and further adjustment to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Those adjustments, if occurring during the measurement period (not to exceed one year), may significantly impact the carrying value of our goodwill. Those adjustments, if occurring outside of the measurement period, may significantly impact our results of operations. \nThe SA provides that the Company will purchase, and Cardinal will supply, all the Company's requirements for certain glass components used in PGT-branded doors through the end of 2024. The terms of the manufacture by Cardinal and purchase by the Company of such glass components as to purchase orders, forecasts of purchases, pricing, invoicing, delivery and payment terms and other terms, are all as described in the SA. Early in the fourth quarter of 2017, we began purchasing and receiving glass components from Cardinal under the SA. At that time, we began amortizing the advance consideration received from Cardinal initially allocated to the SA, recognizing $628 thousand in the year ended December 30, 2017, and $2.8 million and in the year ended December 29, 2018, which is classified as reductions to cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The remaining unamortized balance of $16.7 million is classified in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 29, 2018, as $2.8 million within accrued liabilities and $13.9 million within other liabilities.\nThe 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 mature on August 10, 2026. Interest on the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 is payable semi-annually, in arrears, beginning on February 16, 2019, with interest accruing at a rate of 6.75% per annum from August 10, 2018. We incurred financing costs relating to bank fees and professional services costs relating to the offering and issuance of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 totaling $10.4 million, which is being amortized under the effective interest method. See Deferred Financing Costs\u201d below. As of December 29, 2018, the face value of debt outstanding under the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 was $315.0 million, and accrued interest totaled $8.3 million.\nNet sales for 2017 were $511.1 million, a $52.5 million, or 11.5%, increase in sales, from $458.6 million in the prior year.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nconsolidated balance sheet at December 30, 2017, primarily as the result of our ability to defer our fourth quarter 2017 estimated payment due to the extension of time to January 2018 to make that payment pursuant to the IRS extension of time for companies affected by Hurricane Irma. Other collections of cash and other cash activity, net, increased by $1.6 million.\n- 36 -\nFair Value Measurement Disclosures\nIn connection with the Second Amendment, certain existing lenders changed their positions in or exited the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, which resulted in the write-offs of portions of the deferred financing costs and original issue discount allocated to these lenders. Additionally, at the time of the issuance of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026, certain existing lenders reduced their positions in the revolving credit portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, which resulted in the write-offs of the deferred financing costs allocated to these lenders. As such, write-offs totaling $3.4 million is classified as debt extinguishment costs in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 29, 2018.\nOur Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 8. We also advise you to read the risk factors in Item 1A. Our MD&A is presented in eight sections:\n Indefinite Lived Intangibles The impairment evaluation of the carrying amount of intangible assets with indefinite lives (which for us is our trade names) is conducted annually, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. We have the option of performing a qualitative assessment of impairment to determine whether any further quantitative testing for impairment is necessary. If we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if we determine, based on qualitative factors, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our trade names is less than the carrying amount, an evaluation is performed by comparing the carrying amount of these assets to their estimated fair values. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the intangible asset, then an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value is determined using the relief from royalty method that is based upon the discounted projected cost savings (value) attributable to ownership of our trade names, our only indefinite lived intangible assets. In estimating fair value, the method we use requires us to make assumptions, the most material of which are sales projections attributable to products sold with these trade names, the anticipated royalty rate we would pay if the trade names were not owned (as a percent of sales), and a weighted average discount rate. These assumptions are subject to change based on changes in the markets in which these products are sold, which impact our projections of future sales and the assumed royalty rate. Factors affecting the weighted average discount rate include assumed debt to equity ratios, risk-free interest rates and equity returns, each for market participants in our industry. We completed a qualitative assessment of our PGT trade name on the first day of our fourth quarter of 2018. This qualitative assessment included an evaluation of relevant events and circumstances that existed at the date of our assessment. Those events and circumstances included conditions specific to our PGT trade name, such as the inputs that would be used to calculate their fair values, as well as events and circumstances related to the PGT trade name, such as the industry in which we use the PGT trade name, our competitive environment, the availability and costs of its raw materials and labor, the financial performance of our Company, and factors related to the markets in which our Company operates. We also considered that, for our PGT trade name, no new impairment indicators were identified since the date of our prior assessment, which was a quantitative assessment. Based on that assessment, we concluded that it is more likely than not that our PGT trade name is not impaired. Actual results can differ from our estimates, requiring adjustments to our assumptions. The result of these changes could result in a material change in our calculation and an impairment of our trade names. If our WinDoor brand does not perform to the levels expected in this most recent quantitative assessment of fair value, the WinDoor trade name is at a higher degree of risk for future impairment. \nLong-Term Debt\nOn September 22, 2017, we entered into the APA with Cardinal for the sale to Cardinal of certain manufacturing equipment we used in processing glass components for PGT-branded doors for a cash purchase price of $28.0 million. Contemporaneously with entering into the APA, we entered into a seven-year supply agreement (SA) with Cardinal for Cardinal to supply us with glass components for PGT-branded doors. The Company determined to sell these assets and enter the SA to allow us to heighten our focus in our core areas of window and door manufacturing and, at the same time, strengthen our supply chain for high-quality door glass from a supplier with whom we have been doing business for many years.\nManagement monitors and evaluates raw material inventory levels based on the need for each discrete item to fulfill short-term requirements calculated from current order patterns and to provide appropriate safety stock. Because the majority of our products are made-to-order, we have only a small amount of finished goods and work in progress inventory. Due to these factors, we believe our inventories are not excessive, and we expect the value of such inventories will be realized.\n \u2022 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017; \nAt December 29, 2018, we had $1.1 million in standby letters of credit related to our workers' compensation insurance coverage, and commitments to purchase equipment of $1.2 million.\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842)\u201d, which requires lessees to recognize leases on-balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 was subsequently amended by ASU 2018-01, Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842\u201d; ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases\u201d; and ASU 2018-11, Targeted Improvements\u201d. The new standard requires a lessee to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the income statement.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A)\n- 24 -\nIncome tax expense\nWe expect 2019 full-year sales to range between $775 million and $800 million, representing an increase of between 11% and 15%, as compared to 2018, and includes an estimated range for the first quarter of 2019 of between $174 million and $179 million. A significant portion of the growth in revenues for 2019, compared to 2018, will reflect the inclusion of WWS's results for the entire year of 2019, versus only the post-acquisition period in 2018. We are targeting adjusted net income per diluted share in 2019 of between $0.93 to $1.05, which assumes approximately 59 million weighted-average diluted shares outstanding.\nOn a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such difference could be material. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Item 8, Note 2. The following is a summary of our more significant accounting estimates that require the use of judgment in preparing the financial statements.\nOn September 18, 2018, contemporaneously with the 2018 Equity Issuance, we prepaid $152.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the term loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022. On December 19, 2018, we voluntarily prepaid an additional $8.0 million in borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022. As of December 29, 2018, the principal amount of debt outstanding under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 was $64.0 million, and accrued interest was $0.4 million. Interest expense, net, in the consolidated statement of operations in the year ended December 29, 2018 includes $5.6 million of accelerated amortization of lenders fees and discount relating to the prepayment of $152.0 million and $8.0 million of borrowings under the term loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 we made.\nThe Company has determined that, although the APA and SA are separate agreements, they were negotiated contemporaneously. Therefore, the Company has concluded that the $28.0 million of proceeds under the APA should be bifurcated between the sale of the door glass manufacturing assets, and as payment received from a supplier for the Company's agreement to buy glass components for PGT-branded doors from Cardinal under the SA. The bifurcation of the proceeds in excess of the stand-alone selling price of the assets acquired would be allocated to the SA and recognized as a reduction of cost of sales as glass components are purchased by PGTI. Based on the established stand-alone selling price of the assets sold, as determined by an independent appraisal, approximately $7.7 million was allocated to the sale of the assets, with the remaining $20.3 million representing consideration received from Cardinal related to the agreement to buy door glass components for PGT-branded doors from Cardinal. This consideration is being amortized over the 7-year term of the SA.\nThe Company has recognized the tax impacts related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017. In 2018, we experienced a benefit to our cash flow and a decrease in our overall effective tax rate as the result of the reduction of the Federal corporate income tax rate under the Tax Act, partially offset by the negative impact from the repeal of the Section 199 domestic production activities deduction. In 2018, we had no significant effect on our tax rate or obligation to pay income taxes due to the limitations on the deductions for interest expense and executive compensation.\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, we follow U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations.\n \u2022 In 2017, we entered into the SA with Cardinal Glass Industries under which Cardinal supplies to us glass components for our PGT-branded doors. This arrangement has allowed us to, among other things, leverage Cardinal's industry-leading capabilities and quality-control and enable us to focus on our core area of window and door manufacturing, which has resulted in improved quality of our products and lower manufacturing rework and warranty costs, thereby contributing to improved margins during 2018, which we expect will continue during 2019. We will continue to focus on further improving on the quality of our products, which we expect should further reduce our rework and warranty costs, further benefitting gross margin. \nConsolidated Cash Flows\nOn September 18, 2018, we completed an underwritten, public offering of 7,000,000 shares of our common stock, at a public offering price of $23.00 per share.\nExcluding these items, SG&A of the legacy business was $127.6 million in 2018, or 19.7% of legacy business net sales, compared to $96.5 million in 2017, or 18.9%, an increase of $31.1 million. This increase in SG&A spending is consistent with the higher level of sales, including higher distribution costs, and also includes higher personnel-related costs of approximately $10.7 million, which includes higher incentive compensation reflecting the improved performance in 2018 compared to last year, an increase of $2.4 million due to our strategic investment in additional marketing and advertising initiatives during 2018, as well as an increase in stock-based compensation expenses of $1.4 million in 2018, compared to last year.\nDuring 2018, we made significant prepayments of borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, using proceeds from the 2018 Equity Issuance, as well as from cash on hand. These prepayments will result in a lower level of debt service under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022. However, with the issuance of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026, the level of our debt outstanding increased by $315.0 million, at a fixed interest rate of 6.75%. We believe interest expense on our long-term debt will be approximately $27.0 million in 2019, including an estimated $1.8 million of non-cash amortization of deferred financing costs.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINACIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n- 37 -\nSALE OF DOOR GLASS PROCESSING ASSETS\nTHE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017\n (4) Fees, costs and original issue discount - represents third-party fees, lender fees, other debt-related costs, and original issue discount, recorded as a reduction of the carrying value of the debt pursuant to ASU 2015-03, and are amortized over the lives of the debt instruments under the effective interest method. \nInterest on all loans under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 is payable either quarterly or at the expiration of any LIBOR interest period applicable thereto. Prior to amending the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 on March 16, 2018, as described above, borrowings under the term loans and the revolving credit facility accrued interest at a rate equal to, at our option, LIBOR (with a floor of 100 basis points in respect of the term loan), or a base rate (with a floor of 200 basis points in respect of the term loan) plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin was 475 basis points in the case of LIBOR and 375 basis points in the case of the base rate. The weighted average all-in interest rate for borrowings under the term-loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 was 5.84% as of December 29, 2018 and was 6.21% at December 30, 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for 2018 were $150.9 million, an increase of $52.1 million, or 52.7%, from $98.8 million in the prior year. SG&A in 2018 includes $3.8 million of acquisition costs relating to our recent acquisition of WWS, and in 2017 includes $2.3 million in higher costs related to Hurricane Irma, management reorganization and WinDoor transition actions. Adjusting for these costs in both periods, SG&A was $147.1 million in 2018, or 21.1% of net sales, compared to $96.5 million in 2017, or 18.9% of net sales, an increase of 2.2%. The adjusted increase in SG&A is primarily the result of the inclusion of the SG&A expenses of WWS in 2018 since the acquisition, which totaled $19.5 million, including $3.6 million in non-cash amortization of the amortizable intangible asset acquired in the acquisition. This represents 39.3% of the total sales contribution of WWS of $49.7 million in 2018. We believe that going forward, WWS will carry higher SG&A as a percentage of sales than our legacy business due to WWS's higher transportation costs, and non-cash amortization expense, which we estimate will be approximately $9.4 million annually.\nWe believe the following factors, which are not all inclusive, may impact our gross profit and gross margin in 2019:\n- 25 -\n\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\u201d ASU 2016-13 requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for most financial assets held at the reporting date based on an expected loss model which includes historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Entities will now use forward-looking information to better form their credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 also\n- 32 -\n\nThe increase in cash flows from operations of $51.3 million in 2018 was primarily due to an increase of $187.2 million in collections from customers as the result of increased sales. This increase in collections was partially offset by an increase in payments to suppliers of $118.2 million as the result of higher procurements of inventory due to increased sales, an increase in personnel related disbursements of $24.8 million due to the higher level of employees during 2018, compared to 2017 to support the increase in demand for our products, and a decrease in debt service costs of $5.2 million, primarily as the fact that the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 require semi-annual interest payments, compared to quarterly payments of interest under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022. Accrued interest at December 29, 2018 related to the 2018 Senior notes due 2026 was $8.3 million. Debt service costs decreased also as a result of prepayments of borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 made during 2018. Also, in 2018, compared to last year, net tax payments increased $19.5 million, which includes a federal tax payment of $9.0 million in January 2018 as the result of our ability to defer our fourth quarter 2017 estimated payment due to the extension of time to January 2018 to make that payment pursuant to the IRS extension of time for companies affected by Hurricane Irma. We also received cash totaling $19.0 million in 2018 from Cardinal under the SA. Other collections of cash and other cash activity, net, increased by $2.4 million, primarily related to sales of scrap aluminum.\nWe record warranty costs as a selling expense within selling, general and administrative expenses. Our warranty expense, as a percentage of sales, decreased during 2017, with an average rate of 2.1%, as compared to an average rate of 2.4% during 2016. The decrease in warranty expense as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of our workforce becoming more seasoned through experience and training. We expect that, as our team members continue to gain in experience, and are exposed to improved training initiatives we have implemented, and as we realize the quality-related benefits of our new thermal plastic spacer (TPS) system, an innovative technology for production of insulated glass, our warranty expense, as a percentage of sales, will further decline. We expect that our warranty risk profile has improved due to the SA we entered into with Cardinal in September 2017, pursuant to which the glass components we purchase from Cardinal are warrantied by Cardinal and, thus, any warranty costs for those glass components will be borne by Cardinal.\nOn August 10, 2018, we completed the issuance of $315.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% senior notes ( 2018 Senior Notes Due 2026\u201d), issued at 100% of their principal amount. The 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 are jointly and severally and fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of the Company's existing and future restricted subsidiaries, other than any restricted subsidiary of the Company that does not guarantee the existing senior secured credit facilities or any permitted refinancing thereof. The 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and the guarantors, respectively, and rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior debt and senior to all existing and future subordinated debt of the Company and the guarantors. The 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 were offered under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, and in transactions outside the United States under Regulation S of the Securities Act, and have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nDuring 2018, we generated $100.3 million in cash flow from operations, an increase of $51.3 million over last year, which was used to fund the cash portion of the WWS Acquisition of $39.6 million, make voluntary prepayments of debt of $8.0 million, as well as fund working capital needs, and for capital expenditures of $29.8 million. Our cash flow in 2018 benefitted from proceeds received under the APA, described below, of $24.8 million, but also was reduced by payments of estimated income taxes of $19.5 million, including a federal income tax payment of $9.0 million, relating to our fourth quarter of 2017 estimated payment which was not required to be made until the end of January 2018 due to temporary relief on estimated tax payments for Florida businesses affected by Hurricane Irma.\nOur net income in 2018 was $53.9 million, an increase of $14.1 million when compared to 2017's net income of $39.8 million. Our net income benefitted from improved performance, including a significant increase in sales, and the addition of WWS. The comparison of 2018 net income to 2017 net income is also affected by the fact that net income in 2017 benefitted from the recognition of the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, further described below. In December 2017, we revalued our ending net deferred tax liabilities at December 30, 2017 and recognized a $12.4 million tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 30, 2017, which was adjusted slightly by $0.2 million in tax expense in 2018.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThere were payments of financing costs totaling $12.1 million in 2018, related to both the Second Amendment and the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026. Taxes paid relating to common stock withheld from employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards were $0.7 million in 2018, versus $0.3 million in 2017, an increase in cash used of $0.4 million. Proceeds from the exercises of stock options were $2.2 million in 2018, compared to $0.9 million in 2017, an increase in cash provided of $1.3 million.\nOur inventory consists principally of raw materials purchased for the manufacture of our products and limited finished goods inventory as the majority of our products are custom, made-to-order products. Our inventory levels are more closely aligned with our number of product offerings rather than our level of sales. We have maintained our inventory level to have (i) raw materials required to support new product launches; (ii) a sufficient level of safety stock on certain items to ensure an adequate supply of material in the event of a sudden increase in demand and given our short lead-times; and (iii) adequate lead times for raw materials purchased from overseas suppliers in bulk supply. Inventory turns for the year ended December 29, 2018, was 11.0 times, slightly higher than 10.3 times for the year ended December 30, 2017. This reflects our improved performance during 2018, as well as improvements in inventory management. Inventory turns for the year ended December 30, 2017, was 10.3 times, which decreased from 11.9 times for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in turns reflects an increase in average inventory in 2017 due to several large projects.\nWe expect to continue to be profitable in 2019, and thus, that we will incur income tax expense at a combined Federal and state effective rate of between approximately 26% to 27%. This rate is based on the lower overall corporate income tax rate of 21% as the result of the Tax Act, plus a blended statutory state rate, taking into consideration the effect on our state rate due to our recent acquisition of WWS.\nIncome tax expense\nNet sales for 2018 were $698.5 million, a $187.4 million, or 36.7%, increase in sales, from $511.1 million in the prior year.\nThe majority of other collections of cash are from scrap aluminum sales.\nCapital Expenditures. Capital expenditures vary depending on prevailing business factors, including current and anticipated market conditions. In 2018, we continued to invest in our long-term future by spending $29.8 million for capital expenditures, primarily representing equipment purchases and facility improvements to support growth. In 2017, capital expenditures were $17.8 million, primarily representing equipment purchases for the various glass processing lines in our glass processing facility. Management expects to spend between $32 million and $38 million for capital expenditures in 2019. Our capital expenditure program is geared towards making investments in capital assets targeted at increasing both gross sales and margins, but also includes capital expenditures for maintenance capital.\nIncome tax expense in 2016, benefitted from tax credits totaling $1.2 million, including federal income tax credits recognized related to our research and development efforts for tax years 2012 through 2016, and state incentive tax credits.\nare all considered to be non-impact windows and door products. Sales of WWS included in non-impact window and door products were $49.7 million in 2018.\n \u2022 Aluminum prices, which can fluctuate significantly, increased during the first half of 2018, then decreased through the remainder of the year. We believe that the fluctuations in aluminum prices are in some part affected by the current Presidential Administration's policies towards imports of steel and aluminum, including the potential for the imposition of additional tariffs on such products entering the United States. We believe the uncertainty surrounding the potential for these actions has and may continue to cause increasing or decreasing fluctuations in aluminum prices during 2019, and such fluctuations may be significant. As of the beginning of 2019, we are currently are covered through hedging arrangements for approximately 75 percent of our estimated aluminum requirements through the end of 2019, at an average price of $0.96 per pound, which excludes the Midwest Premium charge for delivery. The current delivered cash price is approximately $0.86 per pound. ", "item_7_text": "Interest expense was $20.3 million in 2017, an increase of $0.2 million from $20.1 million in the prior year. During 2017, we made a total of $40 million voluntary prepayments of borrowings under our 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, which resulted in non-cash write-offs of deferred lenders fees and discount of $1.9 million, classified as interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 30, 2017. These charges offset the savings generated over prior year from our debt repricing we completed in February 2017, which resulted in a one percentage-point decrease in the margin portion of the interest rate, and lower debt levels from previous prepayments. Additionally, we saw increases in LIBOR during 2017, which increased the weighted average interest rate we paid during 2017 since the beginning of the year.\n \u2022 Critical Accounting Estimates; \nSales of our non-impact window and door products increased by $0.7 million, or 0.9%. Included in sales of our non-impact window and door products were $24.9 million of aluminum non-impact sales, a decrease of $2.0 million, or 7.5%, and $52.8 million of vinyl non-impact sales, an increase of $2.7 million, or 5.4%.\n\n\n- 31 -\nInterest expense increased $6.2 million in 2018, compared to 2017. During 2018, we made a total of $160.3 million in payments of long-term debt, substantially all relating to repayments of borrowings under the term loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, which resulted in non-cash write-offs of deferred lenders fees and discount totaling $5.6 million as additional interest\n</td> </tr>\nInventory on hand as of December 29, 2018, was $44.7 million, an increase of $6.9 million from December 30, 2017. The increase was due primarily to the acquisition of WWS. Inventory on hand as of December 29, 2018 includes $13.7 million relating to the WWS Acquisition. Excluding the inventory of WWS, the decrease in inventory includes a decrease of $5.6 million relating to the adoption of ASU 2014-09, which resulted in our recognizing revenue and, therefore, cost of sales, on inventory that was previously considered to be finished goods and work-in-process. Inventory on hand as of December 30, 2017, was $37.8 million, an increase of $7.3 million from January 2, 2016. The increase was due primarily to our decision to hold higher levels of raw materials as we continued to respond to the increase in demand for our products in the fourth quarter of 2017, which has carried over into the first quarter of 2018.\n- 26 -\nThe APA provided for the transfer of the assets from the Company to Cardinal in two phases, with the first date in 2017, and the second date in 2018, on dates which the Company and Cardinal agree to use. Under the APA, the cash purchase price of $28.0 million was to be paid by Cardinal to the Company in three separate payments of $3 million on or about the time of the first transfer of the assets to Cardinal, $10 million on or about January 15, 2018, and $15 million at or about the time of the second transfer of assets to Cardinal.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nEstimated amortization expense relating to third-party fees and costs, lender fees and discount for the years indicated, as of December 29, 2018, is as follows:\nCapital Resources and Debt Covenants\nThe increase in cash flows from operations of $2.6 million in 2017 compared to 2016, was primarily due to an increase of $42.5 million in collections from customers as the result of increased sales. This increase in collections was partially offset by an increase in payments to suppliers of $34.6 million as the result of higher procurements of inventory due to increased sales, an increase in personnel related disbursements of $8.8 million due to the higher level of employees during 2017, compared to 2016 to support the increase in demand for our products, and an increase in debt service costs of $0.3 million, primarily as the result of an increase in LIBOR during 2017, partially offset by lower debt levels from voluntary debt prepayments made during 2017, and a one percentage-point decrease in our margin from the February 2017 refinancing. Also, in 2017 compared to last year, net tax payments decreased $2.2 million, A federal and state income tax liability of $6.5 million was included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying\nGross profit was $243.5 million in 2018, an increase of $84.5 million, or 53.1%, from $159.0 million in the prior year. The gross margin percentage was 34.9% in 2018, compared to 31.1% in the prior year, a percentage-point increase of 3.8%. Adjusting for costs relating to machinery and equipment relocations, as well as an opening balance sheet inventory adjustment relating to our acquisition of WWS, for a total of $1.2 million in 2018, and adjusting for costs relating to Hurricane Irma, WinDoor leadership and glass supply-chain transition costs, and costs relating to the start-up of our Thermal Plastic Spacer system line incurred in January and February, totaling $2.1 million in 2017, the gross margin percentage was 35.0% in 2018, compared to 31.5% in 2017, a percentage-point increase of 3.5%. There were improvements in 2018, compared to last year, relating to higher contribution margins on the increased sales volume, which benefitted gross margin by 1.2%, price increases, which benefitted gross margin by 1.5%, in scrap rates and efficiencies, which benefitted gross margin by 1.0%, a change in mix towards a higher portion of repair and remodeling sales, which benefitted gross margin by 0.7%. These increases were partially offset by decreases due to higher overall material prices, which decreased gross margin by 1.1%, and which included higher aluminum prices compared to last year, partially offset by lower glass costs as a result of our supply agreement with Cardinal Glass Industries, and by higher overhead costs, which decreased gross margin by 1.2%. The addition of WWS benefitted gross margin by 1.4%.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for 2017 were $98.8 million, an increase of $14.8 million, or 17.6%, from $84.0 million in the prior year. As a percentage of net sales, these costs were 19.3% in 2017, an increase of 1.0% from 18.3% in 2016. Contributing to the increase was a $2.5 million increase in selling and distribution costs as the result of an increase in volume, and due to distribution disruptions caused by Hurricane Irma, as well as increased spending for advertising following Hurricane Irma. There were also increases in personnel-related costs of $6.6 million primarily due to higher accrued incentive costs as a result of the Company's improved performance. Also contributing to the increase were $1.0 million of costs from our attendance at and participation in the National Association of Home Builders' International Builders Show in Orlando, Florida in January 2017, $0.9 million in higher depreciation expense on higher recent capital spending, and due to higher bank credit card fees of $0.6 million due to higher credit card collections. Selling, general and administrative expenses also increased due to costs relating to our community outreach activities which we undertook to assist those affected by Hurricane Irma. The remaining increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is related to an increase in the level of administrative activities.\n2018 Equity Issuance\nGross profit and gross margin\nNet sales\nLong-term debt consists of the following:\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n- 22 -\nNet sales of our impact window and door products, which include our PGT WinGuard products, as well as all of CGI's products and the substantial majority of WinDoor's products, were $433.4 million in 2017, an increase of $51.8 million, or 13.6%, driven by an increase in sales of our WinGuard products, primarily our vinyl WinGuard products. Included in sales of our impact-resistant window and door products for 2017 were $304.4 million of aluminum impact sales, an increase of $26.5 million, or 9.5%, and $129.0 million of vinyl impact sales, an increase of $25.3 million, or 24.4%.\nInterest expense\nDeferred Financing Costs\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDuring 2018, we executed on two major capital transactions: (1) the issuance of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026; and (2) the 2018 Equity Issuance. The transactions provided substantial liquidity, the proceeds from which were used to acquire WWS, in the case of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 and used to make a prepayment of borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, in the case of the 2018 Equity Issuance. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for a more detailed discussion of these events.\nOur principal source of liquidity is cash flow generated by operations, supplemented by borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, if ever needed. Our cash generating capability provides us with financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs. Our primary capital requirements are to fund working capital needs, and to meet required debt payments, including debt service payments on borrowings and fund capital expenditures.\nInterest expense\nOperating activities. Cash provided by operating activities was $100.3 million for 2018, compared to $49.0 million for 2017, and compared to $46.4 million for 2016.\nThe following table shows net sales classified by major product category (in millions, except percentages):\nInvesting activities. Cash used in investing activities was $378.4 million in 2018, compared to $14.7 million in 2017, an increase in cash used of $363.7 million. We used $354.6 million of cash to acquire businesses in 2018, whereas in 2017 we had no acquisitions. Also, in 2018, we used cash of $29.8 million for capital expenditures, compared to $17.8 million in 2017, an increase of $12.0 million in cash used. Finally, in 2018, we received proceeds of $6.0 million from the sales of property, plant and equipment, an increase of $2.9 million in cash used and was almost entirely composed of cash received from Cardinal under the terms of the APA, pursuant to which we sold certain door glass manufacturing assets to Cardinal.\nFORWARD OUTLOOK\nThe 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 contains a springing financial covenant that would apply if we draw in excess of twenty percent (20%) of the revolving facility commitment (excluding $7.5 million of undrawn letters of credit and letters of credit and draws thereunder that are cash collateralized at 105% of the stated amount thereof from such availability test). To the extent in effect, the springing financial covenant would prohibit us from exceeding a maximum first lien net leverage ratio (based on the ratio of total first\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 29, 2018 (in thousands):\n- 30 -\nAs a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted effective on December 22, 2017, our Federal corporate income tax rate has been reduced from 35%, to 21%. This reduction in rate has lowered our overall effective tax rate. Additionally, the section 199 domestic manufacturing deduction was repealed. As such, our effective tax rate, excluding the discrete items discussed above, approximates our current combined statutory federal and state rate of approximately 25.5% for 2018. In 2017, the effective tax rate, excluding the effect of the discrete item discussed above, was lower than our then combined statutory federal and state tax rate of 38.8% primarily as the result of the estimated impact of the section 199 domestic manufacturing deduction.\n- 35 -\n- 23 -\n\nItem 7.\n \u2022 Recently Issued Accounting Standards; and \n (1) Includes estimated future interest expense on our term debt under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 at a weighted-average interest rate of 5.84% as of December 29, 2018, which includes a weighted-average base rate of 2.28% and a margin of 3.50%. \nlien (less unrestricted cash) debt to EBITDA) as of the last day of each applicable fiscal quarter. To the extent the springing financial covenant is in effect, the first lien net leverage ratio cannot exceed 4.25:1.00 as of the last day of the fiscal quarter ending on December 29, 2018 and 4.00:1.00 on the last date of each fiscal quarter ending thereafter. We were not required to test our first lien net leverage ratio for the quarter ending December 29, 2018 because we did not exceed 20% of our revolving capacity.\nWe also pay quarterly fees on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility equal to 50 basis points per annum as well as a quarterly letter of credit fee at 575 basis points per annum plus a 12.5 basis-point facing fee per annum on the face amount of any outstanding letters of credit. As of December 29, 2018, there were $1.1 million of letters of credit outstanding and $38.9 million available under the revolver.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act\u201d). The Tax Act includes significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system, including a Federal corporate rate reduction from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation, the elimination of the Section 199 domestic production activities deduction, and further restricting the deductibility of certain already restricted expenses.\nThe activity relating to third-party fees and costs, lender fees and discount for the year ended December 29, 2018, are as follows. All debt-related fees, costs and original issue discount are classified as a reduction of the carrying value of long-term debt:\nLeases\nCash used by financing activities was $39.5 million in 2017, compared with cash provided of $50.3 million in 2016, a decrease in cash provided of $89.8 million. Cash used for repayments of long-term debt in 2017 was $40.1 million, including voluntary prepayments of borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 totaling $40.0 million made during 2017, compared to $203.5 million in 2016, a decrease in cash used of $163.4 million. The February 2016 refinancing resulted in $261.0 million in net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt. In addition, we made payments of financing costs of $7.2 million related to the 2016 refinancing. Purchases of treasury stock were $0.3 million in 2017, versus $2.8 million in 2016, a decrease in cash used of $2.5 million. Proceeds from the exercises of stock options were nearly $0.1 million lower, and there was a decrease in excess tax benefits from option exercises of $1.9 million as a result of our adoption of ASU 2016-09, which eliminated the offsetting classifications of excess tax benefits as both operating and financing cash flows.\nIncome tax expense\n$5.8 million. We recognized gains on disposals for the difference totaling $2.6 million during the year ended December 29, 2018, classified as a separate line item in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 29, 2018.\nWe expect depreciation and amortization will be approximately $36.0 million in 2019.\n \u2022 Disclosures of Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments; \nGross profit was $243.5 million for our 2018 fiscal year, which increased 53.1% when compared to 2017. Our gross profit increased primarily due to higher sales volume, but also benefitted from price increases in 2018, as well as improvements in operational performance, which generated increased efficiencies, and a decrease in scrap rates. Our gross profit also benefitted from product mix. However, inflationary conditions persisted through all of 2018, including in the cost of aluminum, after increasing significantly during the second half of 2017, remained high during the first half of 2018, but then has subsided through the end of 2018. For example, the per-pound market cash price of aluminum, not including the Midwest Premium charge for delivery, began the year at $1.11, but has decreased to $0.85 at the end of the year, and is approximately $0.83 in mid-February 2019. We increased prices for our products during 2018 to cover these cost increases, but in the future, we may not always be able to offset cost increases we incur by increasing our selling prices.\n \u2022 Forward Outlook \nEffective on February 17, 2017, we repriced and amended our 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 for the first time. As there were no changes in lender positions, this action did not result in any modifications or extinguishments of debt. Therefore, there was no charge for debt extinguishment costs in 2017.\n\nInterest expense was $26.5 million in 2018, an increase of $6.2 million from $20.3 million in the prior year. Interest expense in 2018 includes $5.6 million of accelerated amortization of lenders fees and discount relating to the prepayment of $152.0 million of borrowings under the term loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 we made on September 18, 2018 and the voluntary prepayment of $8.0 million we made on December 19, 2018. Excluding this amount, the decrease in interest expense due to a decrease in the average level of outstanding borrowings under the term loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 as the result of the prepayments made during 2018 and 2017, were offset by interest expense from the issuance of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026, composed of $315.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% unsecured senior notes due 2026. The 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 carry a higher per-annum interest rate and have a higher principal amount outstanding than borrowings under the term loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022.\nAnalysis of Selected Items from our Consolidated Statements of Operations\nDay's sales outstanding (DSO), which we calculate as accounts receivable divided by average daily sales, was 40 days on December 29, 2018, compared to 38 days on December 30, 2017, and 33 days on December 31, 2016.\nThe new standard also provides practical expedients for an entity's ongoing accounting. We currently expect to elect the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify, primarily our vehicle and office equipment leases. This means, for those leases that qualify, we will not recognize right-of-use assets or lease liabilities, and this includes not recognizing right-of-use assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases of those assets in transition. We also currently expect to elect the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of our leases.\nThe amounts reflected in the table above for operating leases represent future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases with an initial or remaining term in excess of one year at December 29 2018. Purchase orders entered into in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table. Amounts for which we are liable are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\nGross profit and gross margin\nLooking ahead into 2019, we believe Florida's economic factors that impact our business currently are stable. Single-family housing starts in 2018 grew approximately 10% but are still below what we believe the Florida market can support. However, homebuilder confidence indices ended the year on a down note, although they are still at levels significantly higher than the era of the housing downturn. But concerns over housing affordability have impacted confidence going into 2019, especially relating to sales of single-family homes. The housing market is being impacted by a combination of higher mortgage rates, as well as land and labor shortages, which have led to tight inventories. Yet housing is still getting support from a strong job market, tax cuts, and improving household finances. On a regional basis, homebuilder confidence was down only slightly, and remained steady in the west, indications that our major markets may remain stable in 2019. However, we do not expect to repeat in 2019, the significant level of sales growth we experienced in 2018.\n \u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources; \nNet sales\nOur non-impact window and door products included $72.8 million of aluminum non-impact sales, an increase of $47.9 million, or 192.8%, and $63.9 million of vinyl non-impact sales, an increase of $11.1 million, or 21.1%. Included in sales of WWS's window and door products were $43.3 million of aluminum non-impact sales, and $6.4 million of vinyl non-impact sales.\nExcluding the effects of these discrete items in income tax expense, and certain tax credits received in each period, our effective tax rate in 2018 would have been 25.7%, compared to 36.8% in 2017.\n \u2022 Our gross margin percentages are influenced by total sales due to operating leverage of fixed costs, and also by product mix. While we expect to continue to grow revenues organically, as mentioned above, we expect a significant portion of our revenue growth in 2019 to come from the WWS Acquisition being included in our results for the entire year of 2019, versus only the post-acquisition period in 2018. In general, products of WWS have slightly higher gross margins that PGTI's legacy brands. \n- 28 -\nCardinal paid us $3.0 million in cash on November 1, 2017, $10.0 million in cash on January 16, 2018, and $14.8 million on June 8, 2018, pursuant to the APA. The total proceeds received of $27.8 million was $0.2 million less than the $28.0 million as specified in the APA as we retained certain assets that were initially identified for transfer. On December 15, 2017, machinery and equipment classified as assets held for sale with net book value of $1.5 million, and fair value of $1.9 million was transferred to Cardinal and their equipment rigger, and we recognized a gain for the difference. Substantially all of the remaining machinery and equipment was transferred to Cardinal during the second quarter of 2018, which had a net book value of $3.2 million and fair value of\n2017 Compared with 2016\nThe indenture for the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 includes certain covenants limiting the ability of the Company and any guarantors to, (i) incur additional indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of capital stock or make certain other restricted payments or investments; (iii) enter into agreements that restrict distributions from restricted subsidiaries; (iv) sell or otherwise dispose of assets; (v) enter into transactions with affiliates; (vi) create or incur liens; merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of the Company's assets; (vii) place restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to the Company; and (viii) designate the Company's subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nWe expect to continue to be profitable in 2019, and thus, that we will incur income tax expense at a combined Federal and state effective rate of between approximately 26% to 27%. This rate is based on the lower overall corporate income tax rate of 21% as the result of the Tax Act, plus a blended statutory state rate, taking into consideration the effect on our state rate due to our recent acquisition of WWS.\n\nrequires enhanced disclosures to help financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an entity's portfolio. Subsequently, in November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses\u201d. ASU 2018-19 clarifies the codification and corrects unintended application of the guidance. ASU's 2016-13 and 2018-19 are effective for us for our fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently assessing the impact that adopting these new standards updates will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nInterest expense\nFinancing activities. Cash provided by financing activities was $296.7 million in 2018, compared with cash used of $39.5 million in 2017, an increase in cash provided of $336.2 million. In 2018, we issued the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026, which provided proceeds of $315.0 million. Also, in 2018, we issued Company common stock in the 2018 Equity Issuance, which provided net proceeds of $152.5 million. Using primarily the proceeds from the 2018 Equity Issuance, we made repayments of long-term debt of nearly $160.3 million, compared to $40.1 million in 2017.\nWe had $52.7 million of cash on hand as of December 29, 2018. During 2019, we expect to continue to generate sufficient cash from operations to service the interest requirements on our debt, cover our operating expenses, and spend between $32 million and $38 million for capital expenditures. Because of the prepayments of borrowings totaling $204.0 million we have made since the inception of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, we have no further mandatory required payments remaining until the maturity of the facility in February, 2022 but may continue to make voluntary prepayments in the future as our cash generation and other relevant factors permit. However, no assurances can be given that cash from operations will be sufficient for some or all these purposes.\n- 29 -\nDebt extinguishment costs were $3.4 million in 2018. In connection with the Second Amendment, certain existing lenders changed their positions in or exited the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, which resulted in the write-offs of portions of the deferred financing costs and original issue discount allocated to these lenders. Additionally, at the time of the issuance of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026, certain existing lenders reduced their positions in the revolving credit portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, which resulted in the write-offs of the deferred financing costs allocated to these lenders. As such, write-offs totaling $3.4 million is classified as debt extinguishment costs in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 29, 2018.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) - Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement\u201d. The new guidance modifies disclosure requirements related to fair value measurement. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Implementation on a prospective or retrospective basis varies by specific disclosure requirement. Early adoption is permitted. The standard also allows for early adoption of any removed or modified disclosures upon issuance of this ASU while delaying adoption of the additional disclosures until their effective date. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its fair value disclosures.\nDebt extinguishment costs\nThe new standard is effective for us on December 30, 2018 (the first day of our 2019 fiscal year), with early adoption permitted. We expect to adopt the new standard on its effective date. A modified retrospective transition approach is required, applying the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application. An entity may choose to use either (1) its effective date, or (2) the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements as its date of initial application. We expect to adopt the new standard on December 30, 2018 and use the effective date as our date of initial application. Consequently, financial information will not be updated, and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for dates and periods prior to December 30, 2018. The new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. We expect to elect the \u2018package of practical expedients', which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and direct costs. We do not expect to elect the use-of-hindsight of the practical expedient pertaining to land easements; the later not being applicable to us.\nDirect cash flows from operations for 2018, 2017 and 2016 are presented below:\n \u2022 Sales of Door Glass Processing Assets \n (2) Includes estimated future interest expense on our 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 a fixed interest rate of 6.75% as of December 29, 2018. \nAt the time we ceased using these assets in production, at which time they became available for immediate sale, their net book value was $4.7 million, and they were reclassified from property, plant and equipment, to assets held for sale within other current assets.\n</table>\nIncome tax expense was $11.3 million for 2018, representing an effective tax rate of 17.3%. This compares to income tax expense of $63 thousand for 2017, representing an effective tax rate of 0.2%. Income tax expense in 2018, and 2017, includes excess tax benefits relating to exercises of stock options and lapses of restrictions on stock awards, treated as a discrete item of income tax, totaling $5.2 million and $1.8 million, respectively. Also, income tax expense includes a $12.4 million tax benefit in 2017 due to the revaluation of our ending net deferred tax liabilities at December 30, 2017 as the result of the Tax Act, which was reduced slightly by an adjustment of a $0.2 million tax expense in 2018.\n In evaluating our CGI trade name, no new impairment indicators were identified since the date of our prior assessment, which was a qualitative assessment. However, in January 2019, consistent with management's plan for CGI's Estate Collection of products, we began the process of rebranding our Estate Collection as WinDoor-branded products. This rebranding aligns the Estate Collection's status as a high-end, luxury product line, with WinDoor's focus on the luxury market. We anticipate completion of this rebranding in the first half of 2020. We considered this rebranding of CGI's Estate Collection of products as WinDoor-branded products as a triggering event as it results in a shift in revenues from being sold under the CGI trade name, to being sold under the WinDoor trade name, requiring the CGI trade name to undergo a quantitative assessment. In evaluating our WinDoor trade name, we performed a quantitative assessment, which included the impact of the above-described rebranding of CGI's Estate Collection of products as WinDoor-branded products. \n \u2022 During 2018, our gross profit and gross margin percentage increased in part due to lower scrap rates and higher efficiencies due to improved operating performance. Our focus in 2019 will be to continue to sustain and strive to further improve our scrap rate performance and operating efficiencies, to further improve our margins. \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n \u2022 Results of Operations; \nExcluding the effects of these discrete items in income tax expense, our effective tax rate in 2017 would have been 36.8%, compared to 36.5% in 2016, slightly lower than our combined statutory federal and state tax rate of 38.8%, primarily as the result of the section 199 domestic manufacturing deduction in both years.\nOn March 16, 2018, we entered into an amendment of our 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022. The Second Amendment, among other things, decreases the applicable interest rate margins for the Initial Term Loans (as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022) from (i) 3.75% to 2.50%, in the case of the Base Rate Loans (as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022), and (ii) 4.75% to 3.50%, in the case of the Eurodollar Loans (as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022). On February 17, 2017, we entered into the first amendment to our 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, which also resulted in decreases in the applicable margins, but which did not include any changes in lender positions.\n\nRegarding the first amendment as described above, as there were no changes in lender positions, this action did not result in any modifications or extinguishments of debt. Therefore, there was no charge for debt extinguishment costs in the year ended December 30, 2017.\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the Tax Act, the Company revalued its ending net deferred tax liabilities at December 30, 2017 and recognized a $12.4 million tax benefit in the Company's consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 30, 2017. Upon the filing of our Federal and state income tax return for 2017, in the third quarter of 2018, we recognized an adjustment to this gain of $0.2 million of tax expense.\nOn September 22, 2017, we entered into the APA with Cardinal for the sale to Cardinal of certain manufacturing equipment we used in processing glass components for PGT-branded doors. Substantially all of the remaining machinery and equipment was transferred to Cardinal during the second quarter of 2018, which had a net book value of $3.2 million and fair value of $5.8 million. We recognized gains on disposals for the difference totaling $2.6 million during 2018, classified as a separate line item in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 29, 2018.\nThe offering resulted in gross proceeds to the Company of $161.0 million. Net of an underwriting fee of $1.15 per share, net cash proceeds to the Company approximated $153.0 million. We used $152.0 million of these proceeds to prepay borrowings outstanding under the term loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022. The remainder of the proceeds were used for working capital or general corporate purposes, including payment of offering expenses of approximately $447 thousand, classified as a reduction of additional paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 29, 2018.\ncash proceeds received from Cardinal in November 2017 relating to the terms of the APA, pursuant to which we sold certain door glass manufacturing assets to Cardinal. Cash proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment in 2016 were insignificant.\nAs a result of prepayments of the term loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 totaling $204.0 million since its inception in February 2016, we have no future scheduled repayments until the maturity of the facility on February 21, 2022. The contractual future maturities of long-term debt outstanding, including other debt relating to our software license financing arrangement, as of December 29, 2018, are as follows (at face value):\nThe 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 also contains a number of affirmative and restrictive covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of additional debt, liens on property, acquisitions and investments, loans and guarantees, mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions, asset sales, dividends and other payments in respect of our capital stock, entry into restrictive agreements, prepayments of certain debt and transactions with affiliates, in each case, subject to exceptions and qualifications. The 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 also contains customary events of default. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the amounts outstanding under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 may be accelerated and may become immediately due and payable. As of December 29, 2018, we were in compliance with all affirmative and restrictive covenants.\n2016 Credit Agreement Due 2022\n- 21 -\nWe record warranty costs as a selling expense within selling, general and administrative expenses. During 2018, we recorded warranty expense at a rate of 1.7% of sales, which decreased when compared to the rate in 2017 of 2.1% of sales. We believe the decrease in warranty expense as a percentage of sales was the result of our workforce becoming more seasoned through experience and training, as well as a change in our warranty profile on PGT-branded door glass components produced by Cardinal as part of the SA on which they provide the warranty coverage.\nNet sales\nexpense. Excluding these charges, interest expense increased slightly, as the savings from prepayments of borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, were more than offset by interest by the issuance of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026, which carry a fixed interest rate of 6.75%.\nGross profit was $159.0 million in 2017, an increase of $18.9 million, or 13.5%, from $140.1 million in the prior year. The gross margin percentage was 31.1% in 2017, compared to 30.6% in the prior year, a percentage-point increase of 0.5%. Adjusting for costs relating to Hurricane Irma, WinDoor leadership and glass supply-chain transition costs, and costs relating to the start-up of our Thermal Plastic Spacer system line incurred in January and February, totaling $2.1 million in 2017, and product line termination costs and costs relating to the start-up of our Thermal Plastic Spacer system line incurred totaling $1.6 million in 2016, the gross margin percentage was 31.5% in 2017, compared to 30.9% in 2016, a percentage-point increase of 0.6%. Gross margin was positively impacted by several factors, including improvements in scrap rates and production efficiencies at our PGT and CGI facilities, and a favorable change in product mix, each of which benefitted gross margin by 0.6%, from price increases announced during 2017, which benefitted gross margin by 0.5%, and a favorable impact on higher sales volume, which benefitted gross margin by 0.3%. These improvements were partially offset by decreases resulting from higher material costs, primarily due to the increase in aluminum prices during 2017, which decreased gross margin by 0.7%, higher depreciation, decreasing margin by 0.6%, and due to WinDoor, which negatively impacted gross margin by 0.1%.\n- 38 -\nSales of our non-impact window and door products were $136.7 million in 2018, an increase of $59.0 million, or 76.0%. Driving this increase are the sales of WWS, our recently acquired window and door manufacturer in the western U.S., whose products\n\nLiquidity and Cash Flow\nGross profit and gross margin\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $150.9 million for our 2018 fiscal year, which increased $52.1 million compared to 2017, which includes the SG&A of WWS of $19.5 million, as well as the related acquisition costs of $3.8 million. Higher selling and distribution costs were the main driver of this increase, which is directly related to the significant increase in sales. The second most significant factor was higher personnel-related costs, including higher incentive compensation-related costs due to our improved performance, but also relating to a higher number of employees. Also, beginning in late 2017 after Hurricane Irma, we increased our investment in advertising, and maintained higher advertising levels during 2018 to further promote, in the post-Hurricane Irma environment, the benefits of our impact-resistant products. There was also an increase in depreciation expense during 2018 that contributed to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as compared to last year.\n (3) In July 2017, we entered into a two-year financing arrangement for the purchase of an enterprise-wide software license relating to office productivity software. This financing arrangement requires 24 monthly payments of $26 thousand each. We estimated the value of this financing arrangement to be $590 thousand, using an imputed annual interest rate of 6.00%, which approximates our borrowing rate under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, a Level 3 input. \nThe indenture for the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 gives us the ability to optionally redeem some or all of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 at the redemption prices and on the terms specified in the indenture governing the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026. The indenture governing the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 does not require us to make any mandatory redemptions or sinking fund payments. However, upon the occurrence of a change of control, as defined in the indenture, the Company is required to offer to repurchase the notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.\nCash used in investing activities was $14.7 million in 2017, compared to $119.0 million in 2016, a decrease in cash used of $104.3 million. We used $101.3 million of cash to acquire businesses in 2016, whereas in 2017 we had no acquisitions. Also, in 2017, we used cash of $17.8 million for capital expenditures, compared to $17.7 million in 2016, an increase of $0.1 million in cash used. Finally, in 2017, we received proceeds of $3.1 million from the sales of property, plant and equipment, which includes $3.0 million in\nDISCLOSURES OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS\nGains on sales of assets under APA\n- 33 -\n- 27 -\nWe expect that this standard will have a material effect on our financial position. While we continue to assess all of the effects of adoption, we currently believe the most significant effects relate to the recognition of new right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on our balance sheet for our real estate operating leases and providing significant new disclosures about our leasing activities. We do not expect a significant change in our leasing activities between now and adoption. On adoption, we currently expect to recognize additional operating liabilities of between $30 million and $37 million, with corresponding right-of-use assets of the same amount based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments under current leasing standards for existing operating leases.\nOn February 16, 2016, we entered into the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, among us, the lending institutions identified in the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, and SunTrust Bank, as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent. The 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 establishes new senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate amount of $310.0 million, consisting of a $270.0 million Term B term loan facility maturing in February 2022 that amortizes on a basis of 1% annually during its six-year term, and a $40.0 million revolving credit facility maturing in February 2021 that includes a swing line facility and a letter of credit facility. Our obligations under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 subject to exceptions, guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries that are restricted subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our assets as well as our direct and indirect restricted subsidiaries' assets.\n- 34 -\nLiquidity and capital resources\n (1) Effective on August 10, 2018, the Company completed the issuance of $315.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% senior notes due August 10, 2026, issued at 100% of their principal amount. The senior notes were issued to finance, together with cash on hand, the WWS Acquisition. \nSales and Operations\nThe following table shows net sales by major product category (in millions, except percentages):\nOur sales grew to $698.5 million in our 2018 fiscal year, a 36.7% increase when compared to 2017. This increase includes sales from our August 13, 2018 acquisition of WWS, which totaled $49.7 million, but also resulted from increases in sales of our aluminum and vinyl impact-resistant products, which grew by 28.5% and 32.3%, respectively. Driving these results were increases in the sales of our flagship WinGuard impact-resistant products, including vinyl WinGuard impact-resistant products, which grew by 35.5%, and our aluminum WinGuard impact-resistant products, which grew by 26.4%, both as compared to 2017. Since 2014, our vinyl WinGuard products have grown at a compound annual rate of nearly 35%. The growth in the sales of our vinyl impact products highlights the shift in our markets towards more energy efficient products and our ability to design attractive and innovative windows and doors to meet those needs. We also believe our sales in 2018 benefitted from the heightened awareness of impact-resistant products as the result of Hurricane Irma, which hit our primary markets in mid-September 2017, and our increased advertising following Hurricane Irma. Excluding sales of WWS, our annual sales to the repair and remodel market increased by $104.4 million, or 33.6%, in 2018, as compared to 2017, while new construction sales increased $33.3 million, or 16.6%. By region, our annual sales in Florida increased $111.7 million, or 24.3%, for 2018 compared to 2017, and sales in our out-of-state markets increased $60.0 million, or 169.9%. The increase in out-of-state sales is primarily due to the inclusion of the post-acquisition sales of WWS, which are primarily in the western and southwestern U.S. The remaining increase was related to an increase in international sales.\nNet sales of our impact-resistant window and door products, which include our PGT WinGuard products, as well as all of CGI's products and the substantial majority of WinDoor's products, were $561.8 million in 2018, an increase of $128.4 million, or 29.6%, driven by an increase in sales of our WinGuard products, primarily our vinyl WinGuard products. Included in sales of our impact-resistant window and door products for 2018 were $391.1 million of aluminum impact sales, an increase of $86.7 million, or 28.5%, and $170.7 million of vinyl impact sales, an increase of $41.7 million, or 32.3%.\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses\n2018 Senior Notes Due 2026\n \u2022 Executive Overview; \n \u2022 Our gross profit and gross margin are also influenced by costs of labor. Portions of our labor force have become more tenured and, therefore, labor costs have begun to normalize as efficiencies are achieved. However, the strong jobs environment in Florida has resulted in a contraction in the labor pool, which has caused construction labor market pressure on the Company. We expect the tight construction labor market to continue during 2019. \nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>\n2018 Compared with 2017\n (2) Effective on February 17, 2017, the Company amended and repriced this term loan. Terms of the repriced facility include a one percentage-point reduction in the stated interest rate, to LIBOR of 1.00% plus a margin of 4.75%. The amended term loan facility had quarterly payments of principal of $0.675 million, with a lump sum payment of $253.8 million due February 15, 2022, each of which remained unchanged from the prior facility. Due to prepayments totaling $204.0 million since the inception of the facility, there are no required quarterly payments of principal until the maturity of the facility on February 15, 2022, at which time the remaining outstanding balance of $64.0 million is due. \nOur income tax expense was $63 thousand for 2017, representing an effective tax rate of 0.2%. This compares to income tax expense of $11.8 million for 2016, representing an effective tax rate of 33.2%. Income tax expense in 2017, includes a $12.4 million tax benefit due to the revaluation of our ending net deferred tax liabilities at December 30, 2017 as the result of the Tax Act, Income tax expense in 2017 also includes excess tax benefits totaling $1.8 million. We adopted ASU 2016-09 effective on January 1, 2017. As a result, excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options and lapse of restriction on stock awards are now recognized as a discrete item in tax expense, where previously such tax effects had been recognized in additional paid-in-capital. Income tax expense in 2017 also benefitted from tax credits totaling $0.4 million, including estimated federal income tax credits recognized related to our research and development efforts for 2017, and state incentive tax credits.\nWe are obligated to purchase certain raw materials used in the production of our products from certain suppliers pursuant to stocking programs. If all of these programs were cancelled by us, as of December 29, 2018, we would be required to pay $12.0 million for various materials.\nThis expense category will be affected by the inclusion of the SG&A of WWS for the entire year of 2019, versus the post-acquisition period in 2018. SG&A of WWS included in our 2018 results for the post-acquisition period were approximately $19.5 million. SG&A expenses of WWS in 2019 will include approximately $9.4 million in non-cash amortization expense, compared to $3.6 million in 2018. We also expect our SG&A expenses to be impacted by the continuation of increased advertising spending in 2019. We expect to leverage fixed SG&A on anticipated higher sales in 2019, compared to 2018, and to continue to look for areas within SG&A to drive more efficiencies.\n Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Business Combinations We account for business combinations in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, by applying the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method of accounting requires that we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and the noncontrolling interest, if any, at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. Goodwill is recognized as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Deferred incomes taxes, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances, if any, may be initially established in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. We continue to collect information and reevaluate these estimates and assumptions quarterly. We record any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill, provided that we are within the one-year measurement period. Any contingent consideration is estimated at fair value at the acquisition date. Liability-classified contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings until the contingent consideration is settled. Significant estimates and assumptions are made by management to value such assets and liabilities based on third party valuations such as appraisals or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques. Although we believe that those estimates and assumptions are reasonable and appropriate, they are inherently uncertain and subject to change. If during the measurement period (not to exceed one year), additional information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date related to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we may adjust our estimates to account for subsequent adjustments to the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date, if any, resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the acquisition. On August 13, 2018, we completed the WWS Acquisition. Headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, Western Window Systems designs and manufactures contemporary door and window systems that unify indoor/outdoor living for the residential, commercial and multi-family markets. As a result of the PA, WWS became a wholly-owned subsidiary of PGT Innovations, Inc. and its accounts and results are reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of and from August 13, 2018. The fair value of consideration transferred in the WWS Acquisition was $354.6 million. At December 29, 2018, goodwill resulting from the WWS acquisition totaled $169.8 million. Actual results can differ from our estimates, requiring adjustments to our assumptions. The result of these changes could result in a material change in our calculation and further adjustment to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Those adjustments, if occurring during the measurement period (not to exceed one year), may significantly impact the carrying value of our goodwill. Those adjustments, if occurring outside of the measurement period, may significantly impact our results of operations. \nThe SA provides that the Company will purchase, and Cardinal will supply, all the Company's requirements for certain glass components used in PGT-branded doors through the end of 2024. The terms of the manufacture by Cardinal and purchase by the Company of such glass components as to purchase orders, forecasts of purchases, pricing, invoicing, delivery and payment terms and other terms, are all as described in the SA. Early in the fourth quarter of 2017, we began purchasing and receiving glass components from Cardinal under the SA. At that time, we began amortizing the advance consideration received from Cardinal initially allocated to the SA, recognizing $628 thousand in the year ended December 30, 2017, and $2.8 million and in the year ended December 29, 2018, which is classified as reductions to cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The remaining unamortized balance of $16.7 million is classified in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 29, 2018, as $2.8 million within accrued liabilities and $13.9 million within other liabilities.\nThe 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 mature on August 10, 2026. Interest on the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 is payable semi-annually, in arrears, beginning on February 16, 2019, with interest accruing at a rate of 6.75% per annum from August 10, 2018. We incurred financing costs relating to bank fees and professional services costs relating to the offering and issuance of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 totaling $10.4 million, which is being amortized under the effective interest method. See Deferred Financing Costs\u201d below. As of December 29, 2018, the face value of debt outstanding under the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 was $315.0 million, and accrued interest totaled $8.3 million.\nNet sales for 2017 were $511.1 million, a $52.5 million, or 11.5%, increase in sales, from $458.6 million in the prior year.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nconsolidated balance sheet at December 30, 2017, primarily as the result of our ability to defer our fourth quarter 2017 estimated payment due to the extension of time to January 2018 to make that payment pursuant to the IRS extension of time for companies affected by Hurricane Irma. Other collections of cash and other cash activity, net, increased by $1.6 million.\n- 36 -\nFair Value Measurement Disclosures\nIn connection with the Second Amendment, certain existing lenders changed their positions in or exited the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, which resulted in the write-offs of portions of the deferred financing costs and original issue discount allocated to these lenders. Additionally, at the time of the issuance of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026, certain existing lenders reduced their positions in the revolving credit portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, which resulted in the write-offs of the deferred financing costs allocated to these lenders. As such, write-offs totaling $3.4 million is classified as debt extinguishment costs in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 29, 2018.\nOur Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 8. We also advise you to read the risk factors in Item 1A. Our MD&A is presented in eight sections:\n Indefinite Lived Intangibles The impairment evaluation of the carrying amount of intangible assets with indefinite lives (which for us is our trade names) is conducted annually, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. We have the option of performing a qualitative assessment of impairment to determine whether any further quantitative testing for impairment is necessary. If we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if we determine, based on qualitative factors, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our trade names is less than the carrying amount, an evaluation is performed by comparing the carrying amount of these assets to their estimated fair values. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the intangible asset, then an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value is determined using the relief from royalty method that is based upon the discounted projected cost savings (value) attributable to ownership of our trade names, our only indefinite lived intangible assets. In estimating fair value, the method we use requires us to make assumptions, the most material of which are sales projections attributable to products sold with these trade names, the anticipated royalty rate we would pay if the trade names were not owned (as a percent of sales), and a weighted average discount rate. These assumptions are subject to change based on changes in the markets in which these products are sold, which impact our projections of future sales and the assumed royalty rate. Factors affecting the weighted average discount rate include assumed debt to equity ratios, risk-free interest rates and equity returns, each for market participants in our industry. We completed a qualitative assessment of our PGT trade name on the first day of our fourth quarter of 2018. This qualitative assessment included an evaluation of relevant events and circumstances that existed at the date of our assessment. Those events and circumstances included conditions specific to our PGT trade name, such as the inputs that would be used to calculate their fair values, as well as events and circumstances related to the PGT trade name, such as the industry in which we use the PGT trade name, our competitive environment, the availability and costs of its raw materials and labor, the financial performance of our Company, and factors related to the markets in which our Company operates. We also considered that, for our PGT trade name, no new impairment indicators were identified since the date of our prior assessment, which was a quantitative assessment. Based on that assessment, we concluded that it is more likely than not that our PGT trade name is not impaired. Actual results can differ from our estimates, requiring adjustments to our assumptions. The result of these changes could result in a material change in our calculation and an impairment of our trade names. If our WinDoor brand does not perform to the levels expected in this most recent quantitative assessment of fair value, the WinDoor trade name is at a higher degree of risk for future impairment. \nLong-Term Debt\nOn September 22, 2017, we entered into the APA with Cardinal for the sale to Cardinal of certain manufacturing equipment we used in processing glass components for PGT-branded doors for a cash purchase price of $28.0 million. Contemporaneously with entering into the APA, we entered into a seven-year supply agreement (SA) with Cardinal for Cardinal to supply us with glass components for PGT-branded doors. The Company determined to sell these assets and enter the SA to allow us to heighten our focus in our core areas of window and door manufacturing and, at the same time, strengthen our supply chain for high-quality door glass from a supplier with whom we have been doing business for many years.\nManagement monitors and evaluates raw material inventory levels based on the need for each discrete item to fulfill short-term requirements calculated from current order patterns and to provide appropriate safety stock. Because the majority of our products are made-to-order, we have only a small amount of finished goods and work in progress inventory. Due to these factors, we believe our inventories are not excessive, and we expect the value of such inventories will be realized.\n \u2022 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017; \nAt December 29, 2018, we had $1.1 million in standby letters of credit related to our workers' compensation insurance coverage, and commitments to purchase equipment of $1.2 million.\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842)\u201d, which requires lessees to recognize leases on-balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 was subsequently amended by ASU 2018-01, Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842\u201d; ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases\u201d; and ASU 2018-11, Targeted Improvements\u201d. The new standard requires a lessee to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the income statement.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A)\n- 24 -\nIncome tax expense\nWe expect 2019 full-year sales to range between $775 million and $800 million, representing an increase of between 11% and 15%, as compared to 2018, and includes an estimated range for the first quarter of 2019 of between $174 million and $179 million. A significant portion of the growth in revenues for 2019, compared to 2018, will reflect the inclusion of WWS's results for the entire year of 2019, versus only the post-acquisition period in 2018. We are targeting adjusted net income per diluted share in 2019 of between $0.93 to $1.05, which assumes approximately 59 million weighted-average diluted shares outstanding.\nOn a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such difference could be material. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Item 8, Note 2. The following is a summary of our more significant accounting estimates that require the use of judgment in preparing the financial statements.\nOn September 18, 2018, contemporaneously with the 2018 Equity Issuance, we prepaid $152.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the term loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022. On December 19, 2018, we voluntarily prepaid an additional $8.0 million in borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022. As of December 29, 2018, the principal amount of debt outstanding under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 was $64.0 million, and accrued interest was $0.4 million. Interest expense, net, in the consolidated statement of operations in the year ended December 29, 2018 includes $5.6 million of accelerated amortization of lenders fees and discount relating to the prepayment of $152.0 million and $8.0 million of borrowings under the term loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 we made.\nThe Company has determined that, although the APA and SA are separate agreements, they were negotiated contemporaneously. Therefore, the Company has concluded that the $28.0 million of proceeds under the APA should be bifurcated between the sale of the door glass manufacturing assets, and as payment received from a supplier for the Company's agreement to buy glass components for PGT-branded doors from Cardinal under the SA. The bifurcation of the proceeds in excess of the stand-alone selling price of the assets acquired would be allocated to the SA and recognized as a reduction of cost of sales as glass components are purchased by PGTI. Based on the established stand-alone selling price of the assets sold, as determined by an independent appraisal, approximately $7.7 million was allocated to the sale of the assets, with the remaining $20.3 million representing consideration received from Cardinal related to the agreement to buy door glass components for PGT-branded doors from Cardinal. This consideration is being amortized over the 7-year term of the SA.\nThe Company has recognized the tax impacts related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017. In 2018, we experienced a benefit to our cash flow and a decrease in our overall effective tax rate as the result of the reduction of the Federal corporate income tax rate under the Tax Act, partially offset by the negative impact from the repeal of the Section 199 domestic production activities deduction. In 2018, we had no significant effect on our tax rate or obligation to pay income taxes due to the limitations on the deductions for interest expense and executive compensation.\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, we follow U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations.\n \u2022 In 2017, we entered into the SA with Cardinal Glass Industries under which Cardinal supplies to us glass components for our PGT-branded doors. This arrangement has allowed us to, among other things, leverage Cardinal's industry-leading capabilities and quality-control and enable us to focus on our core area of window and door manufacturing, which has resulted in improved quality of our products and lower manufacturing rework and warranty costs, thereby contributing to improved margins during 2018, which we expect will continue during 2019. We will continue to focus on further improving on the quality of our products, which we expect should further reduce our rework and warranty costs, further benefitting gross margin. \nConsolidated Cash Flows\nOn September 18, 2018, we completed an underwritten, public offering of 7,000,000 shares of our common stock, at a public offering price of $23.00 per share.\nExcluding these items, SG&A of the legacy business was $127.6 million in 2018, or 19.7% of legacy business net sales, compared to $96.5 million in 2017, or 18.9%, an increase of $31.1 million. This increase in SG&A spending is consistent with the higher level of sales, including higher distribution costs, and also includes higher personnel-related costs of approximately $10.7 million, which includes higher incentive compensation reflecting the improved performance in 2018 compared to last year, an increase of $2.4 million due to our strategic investment in additional marketing and advertising initiatives during 2018, as well as an increase in stock-based compensation expenses of $1.4 million in 2018, compared to last year.\nDuring 2018, we made significant prepayments of borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, using proceeds from the 2018 Equity Issuance, as well as from cash on hand. These prepayments will result in a lower level of debt service under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022. However, with the issuance of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026, the level of our debt outstanding increased by $315.0 million, at a fixed interest rate of 6.75%. We believe interest expense on our long-term debt will be approximately $27.0 million in 2019, including an estimated $1.8 million of non-cash amortization of deferred financing costs.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINACIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n- 37 -\nSALE OF DOOR GLASS PROCESSING ASSETS\nTHE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017\n (4) Fees, costs and original issue discount - represents third-party fees, lender fees, other debt-related costs, and original issue discount, recorded as a reduction of the carrying value of the debt pursuant to ASU 2015-03, and are amortized over the lives of the debt instruments under the effective interest method. \nInterest on all loans under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 is payable either quarterly or at the expiration of any LIBOR interest period applicable thereto. Prior to amending the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 on March 16, 2018, as described above, borrowings under the term loans and the revolving credit facility accrued interest at a rate equal to, at our option, LIBOR (with a floor of 100 basis points in respect of the term loan), or a base rate (with a floor of 200 basis points in respect of the term loan) plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin was 475 basis points in the case of LIBOR and 375 basis points in the case of the base rate. The weighted average all-in interest rate for borrowings under the term-loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 was 5.84% as of December 29, 2018 and was 6.21% at December 30, 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for 2018 were $150.9 million, an increase of $52.1 million, or 52.7%, from $98.8 million in the prior year. SG&A in 2018 includes $3.8 million of acquisition costs relating to our recent acquisition of WWS, and in 2017 includes $2.3 million in higher costs related to Hurricane Irma, management reorganization and WinDoor transition actions. Adjusting for these costs in both periods, SG&A was $147.1 million in 2018, or 21.1% of net sales, compared to $96.5 million in 2017, or 18.9% of net sales, an increase of 2.2%. The adjusted increase in SG&A is primarily the result of the inclusion of the SG&A expenses of WWS in 2018 since the acquisition, which totaled $19.5 million, including $3.6 million in non-cash amortization of the amortizable intangible asset acquired in the acquisition. This represents 39.3% of the total sales contribution of WWS of $49.7 million in 2018. We believe that going forward, WWS will carry higher SG&A as a percentage of sales than our legacy business due to WWS's higher transportation costs, and non-cash amortization expense, which we estimate will be approximately $9.4 million annually.\nWe believe the following factors, which are not all inclusive, may impact our gross profit and gross margin in 2019:\n- 25 -\n\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\u201d ASU 2016-13 requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for most financial assets held at the reporting date based on an expected loss model which includes historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Entities will now use forward-looking information to better form their credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 also\n- 32 -\n\nThe increase in cash flows from operations of $51.3 million in 2018 was primarily due to an increase of $187.2 million in collections from customers as the result of increased sales. This increase in collections was partially offset by an increase in payments to suppliers of $118.2 million as the result of higher procurements of inventory due to increased sales, an increase in personnel related disbursements of $24.8 million due to the higher level of employees during 2018, compared to 2017 to support the increase in demand for our products, and a decrease in debt service costs of $5.2 million, primarily as the fact that the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 require semi-annual interest payments, compared to quarterly payments of interest under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022. Accrued interest at December 29, 2018 related to the 2018 Senior notes due 2026 was $8.3 million. Debt service costs decreased also as a result of prepayments of borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 made during 2018. Also, in 2018, compared to last year, net tax payments increased $19.5 million, which includes a federal tax payment of $9.0 million in January 2018 as the result of our ability to defer our fourth quarter 2017 estimated payment due to the extension of time to January 2018 to make that payment pursuant to the IRS extension of time for companies affected by Hurricane Irma. We also received cash totaling $19.0 million in 2018 from Cardinal under the SA. Other collections of cash and other cash activity, net, increased by $2.4 million, primarily related to sales of scrap aluminum.\nWe record warranty costs as a selling expense within selling, general and administrative expenses. Our warranty expense, as a percentage of sales, decreased during 2017, with an average rate of 2.1%, as compared to an average rate of 2.4% during 2016. The decrease in warranty expense as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of our workforce becoming more seasoned through experience and training. We expect that, as our team members continue to gain in experience, and are exposed to improved training initiatives we have implemented, and as we realize the quality-related benefits of our new thermal plastic spacer (TPS) system, an innovative technology for production of insulated glass, our warranty expense, as a percentage of sales, will further decline. We expect that our warranty risk profile has improved due to the SA we entered into with Cardinal in September 2017, pursuant to which the glass components we purchase from Cardinal are warrantied by Cardinal and, thus, any warranty costs for those glass components will be borne by Cardinal.\nOn August 10, 2018, we completed the issuance of $315.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% senior notes ( 2018 Senior Notes Due 2026\u201d), issued at 100% of their principal amount. The 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 are jointly and severally and fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of the Company's existing and future restricted subsidiaries, other than any restricted subsidiary of the Company that does not guarantee the existing senior secured credit facilities or any permitted refinancing thereof. The 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and the guarantors, respectively, and rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior debt and senior to all existing and future subordinated debt of the Company and the guarantors. The 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 were offered under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, and in transactions outside the United States under Regulation S of the Securities Act, and have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nDuring 2018, we generated $100.3 million in cash flow from operations, an increase of $51.3 million over last year, which was used to fund the cash portion of the WWS Acquisition of $39.6 million, make voluntary prepayments of debt of $8.0 million, as well as fund working capital needs, and for capital expenditures of $29.8 million. Our cash flow in 2018 benefitted from proceeds received under the APA, described below, of $24.8 million, but also was reduced by payments of estimated income taxes of $19.5 million, including a federal income tax payment of $9.0 million, relating to our fourth quarter of 2017 estimated payment which was not required to be made until the end of January 2018 due to temporary relief on estimated tax payments for Florida businesses affected by Hurricane Irma.\nOur net income in 2018 was $53.9 million, an increase of $14.1 million when compared to 2017's net income of $39.8 million. Our net income benefitted from improved performance, including a significant increase in sales, and the addition of WWS. The comparison of 2018 net income to 2017 net income is also affected by the fact that net income in 2017 benefitted from the recognition of the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, further described below. In December 2017, we revalued our ending net deferred tax liabilities at December 30, 2017 and recognized a $12.4 million tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 30, 2017, which was adjusted slightly by $0.2 million in tax expense in 2018.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThere were payments of financing costs totaling $12.1 million in 2018, related to both the Second Amendment and the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026. Taxes paid relating to common stock withheld from employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards were $0.7 million in 2018, versus $0.3 million in 2017, an increase in cash used of $0.4 million. Proceeds from the exercises of stock options were $2.2 million in 2018, compared to $0.9 million in 2017, an increase in cash provided of $1.3 million.\nOur inventory consists principally of raw materials purchased for the manufacture of our products and limited finished goods inventory as the majority of our products are custom, made-to-order products. Our inventory levels are more closely aligned with our number of product offerings rather than our level of sales. We have maintained our inventory level to have (i) raw materials required to support new product launches; (ii) a sufficient level of safety stock on certain items to ensure an adequate supply of material in the event of a sudden increase in demand and given our short lead-times; and (iii) adequate lead times for raw materials purchased from overseas suppliers in bulk supply. Inventory turns for the year ended December 29, 2018, was 11.0 times, slightly higher than 10.3 times for the year ended December 30, 2017. This reflects our improved performance during 2018, as well as improvements in inventory management. Inventory turns for the year ended December 30, 2017, was 10.3 times, which decreased from 11.9 times for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in turns reflects an increase in average inventory in 2017 due to several large projects.\nWe expect to continue to be profitable in 2019, and thus, that we will incur income tax expense at a combined Federal and state effective rate of between approximately 26% to 27%. This rate is based on the lower overall corporate income tax rate of 21% as the result of the Tax Act, plus a blended statutory state rate, taking into consideration the effect on our state rate due to our recent acquisition of WWS.\nIncome tax expense\nNet sales for 2018 were $698.5 million, a $187.4 million, or 36.7%, increase in sales, from $511.1 million in the prior year.\nThe majority of other collections of cash are from scrap aluminum sales.\nCapital Expenditures. Capital expenditures vary depending on prevailing business factors, including current and anticipated market conditions. In 2018, we continued to invest in our long-term future by spending $29.8 million for capital expenditures, primarily representing equipment purchases and facility improvements to support growth. In 2017, capital expenditures were $17.8 million, primarily representing equipment purchases for the various glass processing lines in our glass processing facility. Management expects to spend between $32 million and $38 million for capital expenditures in 2019. Our capital expenditure program is geared towards making investments in capital assets targeted at increasing both gross sales and margins, but also includes capital expenditures for maintenance capital.\nIncome tax expense in 2016, benefitted from tax credits totaling $1.2 million, including federal income tax credits recognized related to our research and development efforts for tax years 2012 through 2016, and state incentive tax credits.\nare all considered to be non-impact windows and door products. Sales of WWS included in non-impact window and door products were $49.7 million in 2018.\n \u2022 Aluminum prices, which can fluctuate significantly, increased during the first half of 2018, then decreased through the remainder of the year. We believe that the fluctuations in aluminum prices are in some part affected by the current Presidential Administration's policies towards imports of steel and aluminum, including the potential for the imposition of additional tariffs on such products entering the United States. We believe the uncertainty surrounding the potential for these actions has and may continue to cause increasing or decreasing fluctuations in aluminum prices during 2019, and such fluctuations may be significant. As of the beginning of 2019, we are currently are covered through hedging arrangements for approximately 75 percent of our estimated aluminum requirements through the end of 2019, at an average price of $0.96 per pound, which excludes the Midwest Premium charge for delivery. The current delivered cash price is approximately $0.86 per pound.

36.7% from 2017, driven by strong sales growth of impact-resistant window and door products as well as the acquisition of Western Window Systems (WWS). \n- Net income was $53.9 million in 2018 compared to $39.8 million in 2017. 2017 net income included a $12.4 million tax benefit from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n- Generated $100.3 million in cash from operations in 2018, up from $49.0 million in 2017. Cash flow benefited from higher sales and proceeds from the sale of some assets.\n\nResults of Operations\n- Gross margin was 34.9% in 2018 versus 31.1% in 2017. Margin improved due to higher sales volume, price increases, lower scrap rates, and product mix changes. \n- SG&A expenses were $150.9 million (21.6% of sales) in 2018 compared to $98.8 million (19.3% of sales) in 2017. The increase reflects acquisition costs, higher distribution costs, and more advertising spending.\n- Interest expense rose due to debt activity - prepayments and new debt issuance.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n- Issued $315 million in new 6.75% Senior Notes due 2026 to help finance the WWS acquisition.  \n- Completed a common stock offering, raising net proceeds of $153 million, used to prepay debt.\n- Expect capital expenditures of $32-38 million in 2019 focused on driving sales growth. \n- Well positioned to fund operations, capital spending requirements, and service debt in 2019."}
