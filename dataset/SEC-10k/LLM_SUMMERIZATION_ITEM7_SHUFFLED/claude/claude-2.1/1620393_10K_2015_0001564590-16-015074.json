Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and our historical results of operations. The following should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those projected, forecasted or expected in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those which are discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d in this annual report. Our management believes the assumptions underlying the Company's Financial Statements and accompanying notes are reasonable. However, the Company's Financial Statements may not necessarily reflect our financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2015, we owned all or a majority interest in a portfolio of multifamily properties, or the Portfolio, primarily located in the Southeastern and Southwestern United States consisting of 42 multifamily properties encompassing 13,155 units of apartment space that was approximately 93.9% leased. The weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit in our Portfolio is $803 as of December 31, 2015.\nWe are primarily focused on directly or indirectly acquiring, owning, and operating well-located multifamily properties with a value-add component in large cities and suburban submarkets of large cities, primarily in the Southeastern and Southwestern United States. We generate revenue primarily by leasing our multifamily properties. We intend to employ management and capex value-add programs at a majority of our properties in an attempt to improve rental rates and the net operating income at our properties. We are externally managed by NexPoint Real Estate Advisors L.P., or our Adviser, an affiliate of Highland Capital Management, L.P. (our Sponsor\u201d or Highland\u201d), a leading global alternative asset manager and an SEC-registered investment adviser which, together with its affiliates, had approximately $18.3 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2015.\nThe Company began operations on March 31, 2015 as a result of the transfer and contribution by NexPoint Credit Strategies Fund ( NHF\u201d) of all but one of the multifamily properties owned by NHF through NHF's subsidiary Freedom REIT, LLC ( Freedom REIT\u201d) in exchange for 100% of its outstanding common stock. We use the term predecessor\u201d to mean the carve-out business of Freedom REIT, which owned all or a majority interest in the multifamily properties transferred or contributed to the Company by NHF through Freedom REIT. On March 31, 2015, NHF distributed all of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock held by NHF to holders of NHF common shares. We refer to the distribution of our common stock by NHF as the Spin-Off.\u201d Substantially all of our operations were conducted by our predecessor prior to March 31, 2015. With the exception of a nominal amount of initial cash funded at inception, the Company did not own any assets prior to March 31, 2015. Our predecessor included all of the properties in our portfolio that were held indirectly by Freedom REIT prior to the Spin-Off. Our predecessor was determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d). References throughout this report to the Company,\u201d we,\u201d or our,\u201d include the activity of the predecessor defined above.\nWe intend to elect to be taxed and qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our 2015 tax year. To maintain REIT status, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains.\nComponents of Our Revenues and Expenses\nRevenues\nRental income. Our earnings are primarily attributable to the rental revenue from our multifamily properties. We anticipate that the leases we enter into for our multifamily properties will typically be for one year or less.\nOther income. Other income includes ancillary income earned from tenants such as application fees, late fees, laundry fees, utility reimbursements, and other rental related fees charged to tenants.\nExpenses\nProperty operating expenses. Property operating expenses include property maintenance costs, salary and employee benefit costs, utilities and other property operating costs.\nAcquisition costs. Acquisition costs include the costs to acquire additional properties.\nReal estate taxes and insurance. Real estate taxes include the property taxes assessed by local and state authorities depending on the location of each property. Insurance includes the cost of commercial, general liability, and other needed insurance for each property.\nProperty management fees. Property management fees include fees paid to BH or other third party management companies for managing each property.\nAdvisory and administrative fees. Advisory and administrative fees include the fees paid to our Adviser pursuant to the Advisory Agreement.\nCorporate general and administrative expenses. Corporate general and administrative expenses include but are not limited to payments of reimbursements to the Adviser, audit fees, legal fees, listing fees, board of director fees, and investor relation costs. The reimbursement of Adviser Operating Expenses, administrative fees and the advisory fees paid to our Adviser (including advisory and administrative fees on New Assets) will not exceed 1.5% of Average Real Estate Assets per calendar year (or part thereof that the Advisory Agreement is in effect), or the Expense Cap\u201d. The Expense Cap does not limit the reimbursement by the Company of expenses related to securities offerings paid by the Adviser. The Expense Cap also does not apply to legal, accounting, financial, due diligence and other service fees incurred in connection with mergers and acquisitions, extraordinary litigation or other events outside the Company's ordinary course of business or any out-of-pocket acquisition or due diligence expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition or disposition of real estate assets.\nProperty general and administrative expenses. Property general and administrative expenses include the costs of marketing, professional fees, general office supplies, and other administrative related costs of each property.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization costs primarily include depreciation of our multifamily properties and amortization of acquired in-place leases.\nInterest expense. Interest expense primarily includes the cost of interest expense on debt, the amortization of deferred financing costs, and the fair value adjustments on interest rate caps that are not designated as hedges.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013\nAt the time of the Spin-Off, which occurred on March 31, 2015, the Company owned all or a majority interest in a portfolio of 38 multifamily properties. Following the Spin-Off, the Company acquired one property in April 2015, two properties in August 2015, and one property in October 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the Company owned all or a majority interest in a portfolio of multifamily properties, or the Portfolio, primarily located in the Southeastern and Southwestern United States, consisting of 42 multifamily properties encompassing 13,155 units of apartment space that was approximately 93.9% leased. The weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit in our Portfolio is $803 as of December 31, 2015.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the Company's operating results for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 (in thousands):\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 117,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 43,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (110,181\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (53,409\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (486\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,259\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (170\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,469\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,274\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,992\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17,533\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (170\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (160\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,932\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10,832\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (15,601\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (170\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe change in the Company's operating results for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the operating results for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily relates to the Company acquiring, owning and operating an additional 10 properties for a total of 42 properties as of December 31, 2015 as compared to acquiring, owning and operating 32 properties as of December 31, 2014, as well as increases in same store operating results. The change in the Company's operating results for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the operating results for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily relates to the Company acquiring, owning and operating an additional 31 properties for a total of 32 properties as of December 31, 2014 as compared to acquiring, owning and operating one property as of December 31, 2013.\nRevenues\nRental income. Rental income was $103.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was an increase of approximately $65.2 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to the acquisition of 10 additional properties. Also, 22 of the 32 properties owned as of December 31, 2014 were acquired during the second half of 2014 and therefore only contributed for less than half of the year in 2014 versus the entire year in 2015. We have also experienced an increase in rental income from our properties based upon increased rents and increased occupancy rates due to the value-add programs that we have implemented as well as organic growth in rents in the markets where these properties are located. Rental income was $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was an increase of approximately $38.3 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to the acquisition of 31 additional properties.\nOther income. Other income was $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was an increase of approximately $9.3 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to the acquisition of 10 additional properties. Also, 22 of the 32 properties owned as of December 31, 2014 were acquired during the second half of 2014 and therefore only contributed for less than half of the year in 2014 versus the entire year in 2015. Other income was $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was an increase of approximately $4.6 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to the acquisition of 31 additional properties.\nExpenses\nProperty operating expenses. Property operating costs were $34.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was an increase of approximately $22.0 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to the acquisition of 10 additional properties. Also, 22 of the 32 properties owned as of December 31, 2014 were acquired during the second half of 2014 and therefore only contributed for less than half of the year in 2014 versus the entire year in 2015. Property operating costs were $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was an increase of approximately $12.2 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to the acquisition of 31 additional properties.\nAcquisition costs. Acquisition costs were $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was a decrease of approximately $5.6 million. The decrease between the periods was due to the lower level of acquisitions completed during the period. Acquisition costs were $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was an increase of approximately $8.5 million. The increase between the periods was due to the higher level of acquisitions completed during the period. Acquisition costs depend on the specific circumstances of each closing and are one-time costs associated with each acquisition.\nReal estate taxes and insurance. Real estate taxes and insurance costs were $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was an increase of approximately $9.5 million. The increase for the period was primarily due to the acquisition of 10 additional properties. Also, 22 of the 32 properties owned as of December 31, 2014 were acquired during the second half of 2014 and therefore only contributed for less than half of the year in 2014 versus the entire year in 2015. Real estate taxes and insurance costs were $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was an increase of approximately $5.7 million. The increase for the period was primarily due to the acquisition of 31 additional properties. Further, the costs for property taxes incurred in the first year of ownership may be significantly less than subsequent years since the purchase price of the property may trigger a significant increase in assessed value by the taxing authority in subsequent years, increasing the costs of real estate taxes.\nProperty management fees. Property management fees were $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was an increase of approximately $2.2 million. The increase for the period was primarily due to the acquisition of 10 additional properties. Also, 22 of the 32 properties owned as of December 31, 2014 were acquired during the second half of 2014 and therefore only contributed for less than half of the year in 2014 versus the entire year in\n2015. Property management fees were $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was an increase of approximately $1.3 million. The increase for the period was primarily due to the acquisition of 31 additional properties.\nAdvisory and administrative fees. Advisory and administrative fees were $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was an increase of approximately $3.9 million. The increase for the period was due to the acquisition of 10 additional properties, seven of which are defined as Contributed Assets and three of which are defined as New Assets pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, which increases the basis on which the fee is earned. Following the Spin-Off, the amount paid in 2015 represents the maximum fee allowed on Contributed Assets under the Advisory Agreement plus approximately $0.2 million of advisory and administrative fees incurred on Madera Point, The Pointe at the Foothills, and The Place at Vanderbilt, defined as New Assets pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, for the three months ended December 31, 2015. Advisory and administrative fees were $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was an increase of approximately $1.7 million. The increase for the period was due to the acquisition of 31 additional properties. Advisory and administrative fees may increase in future periods as the Company acquires additional properties.\nCorporate general and administrative expenses. Prior to the completion of the Spin-Off, the Company did not incur any corporate general and administrative costs. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred corporate general and administrative expenses of $2.5 million. Corporate general and administrative expenses may increase in future periods as the Company acquires additional properties. For the year ended December 31, 2015, there were no fees that exceeded the Expense Cap.\nProperty general and administrative expenses. Property general and administrative costs were $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was an increase of approximately $3.3 million. The increase for the period was primarily due to the acquisition of 10 additional properties. Also, 22 of the 32 properties owned as of December 31, 2014 were acquired during the second half of 2014 and therefore only contributed for less than half of the year in 2014 versus the entire year in 2015. Property general and administrative costs were $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was an increase of approximately $2.1 million. The increase for the period was primarily due to the acquisition of 31 additional properties.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization costs were $40.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was an increase of approximately $19.2 million. The increase for the period was primarily due to the acquisition of 10 additional properties. Also, 22 of the 32 properties owned as of December 31, 2014 were acquired during the second half of 2014 and therefore only contributed for less than half of the year in 2014 versus the entire year in 2015. Depreciation and amortization costs were $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was an increase of approximately $21.5 million. The increase for the period was primarily due to the acquisition of 31 additional properties. The amortization of intangible lease assets over a six-month period from the date of acquisition is also expected to increase the amortization expense during the initial year of operations for each property. For the year ended December 31, 2015, there were 10 new properties with amortizing intangible lease assets and for the year ended December 31, 2014, there were 31 new properties with amortizing intangible lease assets.\nInterest expense. Interest expense costs were $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was an increase of approximately $11.2 million. The increase for the period was primarily due to the acquisition of 10 additional properties. Also, 22 of the 32 properties owned as of December 31, 2014 were acquired during the second half of 2014 and therefore only contributed for less than half of the year in 2014 versus the entire year in 2015. There were no interest expense costs for the year ended December 31, 2013. The following is a table that details the various costs included in interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 (in thousands):\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on debt\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of deferred financing costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rate cap market adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Measurements\nNet Operating Income\nNet Operating Income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. NOI is used by investors and our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties to other comparable properties, to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of our properties as NOI is not affected by (1) the cost of funds, (2) acquisition costs, (3) non-operating fees to affiliates, (4) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP, (5) corporate general and administrative expenses, (6) other gains and losses that are specific to us, and (7) entity level general and administrative expenses that are either non-recurring in nature or incurred on behalf of the Company at the property level for expenses such as legal, professional and franchise tax fees.\nThe cost of funds is eliminated from net income (loss) because it is specific to our particular financing capabilities and constraints. The cost of funds is also eliminated because it is dependent on historical interest rates and other costs of capital as well as past decisions made by us regarding the appropriate mix of capital which may have changed or may change in the future. Acquisition costs and non-operating fees to affiliates are eliminated because they do not reflect continuing operating costs of the property owner. Depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets are eliminated because they may not accurately represent the actual change in value in our multifamily properties that result from use of the properties or changes in market conditions. While certain aspects of real property do decline in value over time in a manner that is reasonably captured by depreciation and amortization, the value of the properties as a whole have historically increased or decreased as a result of changes in overall economic conditions instead of from actual use of the property or the passage of time. Gains and losses from the sale of real property vary from property to property and are affected by market conditions at the time of sale which will usually change from period to period. Entity level general and administrative are eliminated as they are specific to the way in which we have chosen to hold our properties and are the result of our joint venture ownership structuring. Also, non-recurring expenses that are incurred upon acquisition of a property do not reflect continuing operating costs of the property owner. These gains and losses can create distortions when comparing one period to another or when comparing our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies that have not made similarly timed purchases or sales. We believe that eliminating these costs from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual ongoing revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating our properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.\nHowever, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes corporate general and administrative costs, interest expense, interest income and other expense, acquisition costs, certain fees to affiliates, depreciation and amortization expense and gains or losses from the sale of properties, and other gains and losses as stipulated by GAAP, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which are significant economic costs. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of net income which further limits its usefulness.\nNOI is a measure of the operating performance of our properties but does not measure our performance as a whole. NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income (loss) as computed in accordance with GAAP. This measure should be analyzed in conjunction with net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP and discussions elsewhere in -Results of Operations\u201d regarding the components of net income (loss) that are eliminated in the calculation of NOI. Other companies may use different methods for calculating NOI or similarly entitled measures and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies that do not define the measure exactly as we do.\nNOI for the Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013\nThe following table, which has not been adjusted for the effects of any noncontrolling interests, details our net operating income for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 (in thousands):\nTable 172: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10,992\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (17,533\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (170\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Advisory and administrative fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-recurring property general and administrative\nexpenses and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net operating income\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFFO and AFFO\nWe believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. We also believe that funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d), and adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation except on land, such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined by NAREIT as net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and impairment charges. We compute FFO attributable to common stockholders in accordance with NAREIT's definition. Our presentation differs slightly in that we begin with Net Loss before adjusting for noncontrolling interest and show the noncontrolling interest as an adjustment to arrive at FFO attributable to common stockholders. AFFO is calculated by adjusting our FFO by adding back items that do not reflect ongoing property operations, such as acquisition expenses, equity-based compensation expenses, the amortization of deferred loan costs, and the noncontrolling interests related to these items. AFFO will also be adjusted to include any gains (losses) from sales of property to the extent excluded from FFO. We will not have any equity-based compensation expenses unless and until our stockholders approve an amendment to the Company's charter to remove the 1940 Act compliance requirements.\nWe believe that the use of FFO and AFFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO and AFFO to be useful measures for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, impairment charges and real estate depreciation and amortization, and, for AFFO, by excluding non-cash expenses such as acquisition expenses, equity-based compensation expenses and the amortization of deferred loan costs, FFO and AFFO can help investors compare our operating performance between periods and to other REITs. While FFO and AFFO are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of REITs, they do not represent cash flows from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO and AFFO do not purport to be indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to FFO and AFFO reported by other REITs that do not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition or define AFFO differently than we do.\nThe following table reconciles our calculations of FFO and AFFO to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nTable 173: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10,992\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (17,533\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (170\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on eminent domain (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (158\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustment for noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,012\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (563\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FFO attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (28\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FFO per share\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.00\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on eminent domain (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of deferred financing costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity-based compensation expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustment for noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (365\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,049\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AFFO attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AFFO per share\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> On August 4, 2015, the Department of Transportation of the State of Georgia ( DOT\u201d), through exercise of eminent domain, appropriated 0.966 acres of land and certain access rights from The Crossings in Marietta, GA and paid the sum of approximately $0.3 million as just and adequate compensation.

Also, 22 of the 32 properties owned as of December 31, 2014 were acquired during the second half of 2014 and therefore only contributed for less than half of the year in 2014 versus the entire year in 2015. Additionally, the increases in FFO and AFFO reflect increased Same Store revenues, net of increases in Same Store expenses. The change in the Company's FFO and AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to FFO and AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily relates to the Company acquiring, owning and operating an additional 31 properties for a total of 32 properties as of December 31, 2014, as compared to acquiring, owning and operating one property as of December 31, 2013.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our multifamily properties, including:\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the repayment of the Bridge Facility if we are unable to extend or refinance the Bridge Facility;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> recurring maintenance necessary to maintain our multifamily properties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> interest expense and scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness (see -Obligations and Commitments\u201d);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> distributions necessary to qualify for taxation as a REIT;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> capital expenditures to complete our value-add program and to improve the quality and performance of our multifamily properties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> advisory fees payable to our Adviser;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> administrative fees payable to our Adviser;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> general and administrative expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> reimbursements to our Adviser; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> property management fees payable to BH.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and existing cash balances. As of December 31, 2015, we have reserved approximately $24.5 million for our planned capital expenditures to implement our value-add program.\nOur long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the costs of acquiring additional multifamily properties, renovations and other capital expenditures to improve our multifamily properties and scheduled debt payments and distributions. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, which may include a revolving credit facility and future debt or equity issuances, existing working capital, net cash provided by operations, long-term mortgage indebtedness and other secured and unsecured borrowings. However, there are a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to access these capital sources, including the state of overall equity and credit markets, our degree of leverage, our unencumbered asset base and borrowing restrictions imposed by lenders (including as a result of any failure to comply with financial covenants in our existing and future indebtedness), general market conditions for REITs, our operating performance and liquidity and market perceptions about us. The success of our business strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to access these various capital sources.\nIn addition to our value-add program, our multifamily properties will require periodic capital expenditures and renovation to remain competitive. Also, acquisitions, redevelopments or expansions of our multifamily properties will require significant capital outlays. Long-term, we may not be able to fund such capital improvements solely from net cash provided by operations because we must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deductions for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT, and we are subject to tax on any retained income and gains. As a result, our ability to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions or redevelopment through retained earnings long-term is very limited. Consequently, we expect to rely heavily upon the availability of debt or equity capital for these purposes. If we are unable to obtain the necessary capital on favorable terms, or at all, our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe believe that our available cash, expected operating cash flows and potential debt or equity financings will provide sufficient funds for our operations, anticipated scheduled debt service payments and dividend requirements for the twelve-month period following December 31, 2015.\nCash Flows\nThe following table presents selected data from the Company's combined consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 (in thousands):\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (268,579\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (637,723\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,152\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 251,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 647,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase in cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, end of period\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe changes in the Company's overall cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily relate to the Company acquiring, owning and operating an additional 10 properties for a total of 42 properties as of December 31, 2015 as compared to acquiring, owning and operating 32 properties as of December 31, 2014. Also, 22 of the 32 properties owned as of December 31, 2014 were acquired during the second half of 2014 and therefore only contributed for less than half of the year in 2014 versus the entire year in 2015. The changes in the Company's overall cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily relate to the Company acquiring, owning and operating an additional 31 properties for a total of 32 properties as of December 31, 2014 as compared to acquiring, owning and operating one property as of December 31, 2013.\nCash flows from operating activities. During the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $21.0 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. During the\nyear ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $2.9 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in net cash from operating activities for both periods was mainly due to changes in net loss, depreciation and amortization, and working capital items resulting from the acquisition of additional properties.\nCash flows from investing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $268.6 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $637.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash used in investing activities was $637.7 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities for both periods was mainly due to the change in acquisition activity, which varies based on specific acquisition and renovation projects that are ongoing at each respective property. In addition, there is a fluctuation of renovation reserves being established at closing for the value-add programs at each property for each period.\nCash flows from financing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $251.1 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $647.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities for the period was mainly due to the level of activity related to the debt funded on the respective property closings and capital contributed at each closing. During the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was $647.3 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities for the period was mainly due to the level of activity related to the debt funded on the respective property closings and capital contributed at each closing.\nMortgage Indebtedness\nAs of December 31, 2015, our subsidiaries have aggregate mortgage indebtedness to third parties of approximately $682.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding mortgage indebtedness related to the Company was 2.67%. For additional information regarding our mortgage indebtedness, see Note 6 to our combined consolidated financial statements.\nWe entered into and expect to continue to enter into interest rate cap agreements with various third parties to cap the variable interest rates on a majority of our outstanding mortgage indebtedness. These agreements generally have a term of three to four years and cover the outstanding principal amount of the underlying indebtedness. Under these agreements, we pay a fixed fee in exchange for the counterparty to pay any interest above a maximum rate. At December 31, 2015, interest rate cap agreements covered $577.9 million of the $636.8 million of total outstanding floating rate mortgage indebtedness relating to the Company. These interest rate cap agreements cap the related variable interest rates of our mortgage indebtedness at a weighted average interest rate of 5.99% as of December 31, 2015. Three mortgages totaling $58.9 million did not have caps associated with them as of December 31, 2015.\nEach property has a separate non-recourse mortgage which is secured only by that property. These non-recourse mortgages have standard scope non-recourse carve outs required by agency lenders and generally call for protection by the borrower and the guarantor against losses by the lender for so-called bad acts,\u201d such as misrepresentations, and may include full recourse liability for more significant events such as bankruptcy. We and our property manager, BH, and its affiliates, provided non-recourse carve out guarantees for the mortgage indebtedness currently outstanding relating to the Portfolio.\nWe intend to invest in additional multifamily properties as suitable opportunities arise and adequate sources of equity and debt financing are available. We expect that future investments in properties, including any improvements or renovations of current or newly-acquired properties, will depend on and will be financed by, in whole or in part, our existing cash, future borrowings and the proceeds from additional issuances of common stock or other securities. In addition, we may seek financing from U.S. government agencies, including through Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD\u201d), in appropriate circumstances in connection with the acquisition or refinancing of existing mortgage loans.\nAlthough we expect to be subject to restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, we expect that we will be able to refinance existing indebtedness or incur additional indebtedness for acquisitions or other purposes, if needed. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness, incur additional indebtedness or access additional sources of capital, such as by issuing common stock or other debt or equity securities, on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.\nFurthermore, following the completion of our value-add and capital expenditures programs and depending on the interest rate environment at the applicable time, we may seek to refinance our floating rate debt into longer-term fixed rate debt at lower leverage levels.\nCompany-specific Indebtedness\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company has a $29.0 million Bridge Facility payable to Key Bank, N.A., which is recourse to the Company. The Bridge Facility bears interest at an annual rate of 4.00% plus one-month LIBOR. The Bridge Facility is payable in full on August 4, 2016. We are in discussions with Key Bank, N.A. to convert the Bridge Facility to a revolving credit facility or otherwise extend the maturity date, alleviating the necessity to repay the Bridge Facility in full in August 2016. If we are unable to convert the Bridge Facility, we plan to use cash on hand, cash from operations or proceeds from the refinancing of current debt in amounts in excess of the current balances to repay the Bridge Facility.\nObligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations and commitments for the next five years and thereafter as of December 31, 2015. Interest expense due by period on our floating rate debt is based on one-month and three-month LIBOR as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Principal payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 682,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 72,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 559,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 791,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 89,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 581,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bridge Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Principal payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations and\ncommitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 821,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 26,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 30,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 89,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 581,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn October 21, 2015, the Company refinanced the $13.1 million existing fixed rate HUD loan on Regatta Bay with a $14.0 million, full-term interest only, floating rate loan that has an interest rate equal to three-month LIBOR (subject to a floor of 0.25%) plus 1.70%. The Company incurred a 5.0% pre-payment penalty of approximately $0.7 million on the refinancing, received approximately $0.3 million in net proceeds from the new loan, and will realize annual savings of approximately $0.4 million based on three-month LIBOR as of December 31, 2015. The new loan matures on November 1, 2020 and can be pre-paid in the first 12 months of the term at par plus 1.00% and at par thereafter.\nCapital Expenditures and Value-Add Program\nWe anticipate incurring average annual repairs and maintenance expense of $575-$725 per unit in connection with the ongoing operations of our business. In addition, we reserve, on average, approximately $250 to $350 per unit for non-recurring capital expenditures and or lender required replacement reserves. Although we will continuously monitor the adequacy of this average, we believe these figures to be sufficient to maintain the properties at a high level in the markets in which we operate. A majority of the properties in our Portfolio were underwritten and acquired with the premise that we would invest $4,000-$10,000 per unit in the first 24-36 months of ownership, in an effort to add value to the asset's exterior and interiors. In most cases, we reserved cash at closing to fund these planned capital expenditures and value-add improvements. As of December 31, 2015, we have reserved approximately $24.5 million for our planned capital expenditures and other expenses to implement our value-add program. The following table sets forth a summary of the Company's capital expenditures related to its value-add program for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rehab Expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interior (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Exterior and common area\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total rehab expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Includes total capital expenditures during the period on completed and in-progress interior rehabs.

In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates for such new or revised standards. We may elect to comply with public company effective dates at any time, and such election would be irrevocable pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act.\nWe could remain an emerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of becoming a public company, (2) the last day of the first fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1 billion or more, (3) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act (which would occur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million, measured as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and we have been publicly reporting for at least 12 months) or (4) the date on which we have, during the preceding three year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt.\nIncome Taxes\nWe anticipate that we will qualify to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our first taxable year of operations as a separate public company, and we intend to continue to be organized and to operate in a manner that will permit us to qualify as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on income that we distribute as dividends to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates, and dividends paid to our stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing taxable income. Any resulting corporate liability could be substantial and could materially and adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. Unless we were entitled to relief under certain Code provisions, we also would be disqualified from re-electing to be taxed as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify to be taxed as a REIT.\nHistorically, our operations were included in Freedom REIT's U.S. federal and state income tax returns and our operations for 2015 until the Spin-Off will be included in Freedom REIT's U.S. federal and state income tax returns for the taxable year ended December 31, 2015. Freedom REIT elected to be taxed as a REIT beginning with its taxable year ending December 31, 2013 and Freedom REIT has covenanted to us to use its reasonable best efforts to maintain its REIT status for its taxable year ending on December 31, 2015. With respect to its taxable years ending December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014, it distributed 100% of its REIT taxable income and therefore did not owe any U.S. federal income tax. If Freedom REIT fails to qualify as a REIT, it would be subject to U.S. federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on its taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates. In addition, unless we were entitled to relief under certain Code provisions, we also would be disqualified from electing to be taxed as a REIT if Freedom REIT fails to qualify as a REIT for its taxable years ending on or before December 31, 2015 and we are treated as a successor to Freedom REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Although Freedom REIT represented to us that it has no knowledge of any fact or circumstance that would cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT, and covenanted in the agreement between us and our Adviser to use its reasonable best efforts to maintain its REIT status for each of Freedom REIT's taxable years ending on or before December 31, 2015, no assurance can be given that such representation and covenant would prevent us from failing to qualify as a REIT.\nDividends\nWe intend to make regular quarterly dividend payments to holders of our common stock. U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100% of its taxable income. We intend to make regular quarterly dividend payments of all or substantially all of our taxable income to holders of our common stock out of assets legally available for this purpose, if and to the extent authorized by our Board. Before we make any dividend payments, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating requirements and debt service on our debt payable. If our cash available for distribution is less than our taxable income, we could be required to sell assets, borrow funds or raise additional capital to make cash dividends or we may make a portion of the required dividend in the form of a taxable distribution of stock or debt securities.\nWe will make dividend payments based on our estimate of taxable earnings per share of common stock, but not earnings calculated pursuant to GAAP. Our dividends and taxable income and GAAP earnings will typically differ due to items such as depreciation and amortization, fair value adjustments, differences in premium amortization and discount accretion, and non-deductible general and administrative expenses. Our quarterly dividends per share may be substantially different than our quarterly taxable earnings and GAAP earnings per share. The Board declared the Company's third quarterly dividend of $0.206 per share on November 10, 2015, which was paid on December 31, 2015 and funded out of operations.\nDistribution Reinvestment Program\nOur distribution reinvestment program provides our stockholders with an opportunity to acquire additional shares of common stock by reinvesting distributions. Stockholders who elect to participate in the distribution reinvestment program authorize us to use distributions payable to them to acquire additional shares of common stock. A participant is not able to acquire common stock under the program if the purchase would cause the participant to exceed the 6.2% ownership limit or would violate any of the other stock ownership restrictions imposed by our charter or securities laws.\nThe distribution reinvestment program may purchase fractional shares of common stock, so that 100% of distributions will be used to acquire common stock. Common stock is purchased under the distribution reinvestment program on the record date for the distribution used to purchase the common stock. Distributions on common stock acquired pursuant to the distribution reinvestment program are paid at the same time as distributions are paid on common stock purchased outside the program and are calculated with a daily record and distribution declaration date.\nShares for the distribution reinvestment program are acquired from the exchange or market on which our shares are listed at the prevailing market price. If we use the services of a broker to acquire shares of our common stock in connection with the distribution reinvestment program, we will allocate the costs of such broker among all of the participants in the program. We will not charge these investors for any fees other than the actual third-party out-of-pocket expenses that we incur. Neither we, nor our Adviser, nor our affiliates receives a fee for managing the distribution reinvestment program. We do not warrant or guarantee that participants will acquire shares at the lowest possible price through the program.\nA participant may stop participating in the distribution reinvestment program at any time without penalty, by delivering written notice to us. Within 90 days after the end of our fiscal year, we will provide each participant with an individualized report on his or her investment, including the purchase date, purchase price and number of shares owned, as well as the dates of distribution and amount of distributions received during the prior fiscal year. The individualized statement to participants will include receipts and purchases relating to each participant's participation in the distribution reinvestment program including the tax consequences relative thereto.\nThe directors, including a majority of independent directors, by majority vote may amend or terminate the distribution reinvestment program upon 10 days' notice to participants.\nStockholders who participate in the distribution reinvestment program will recognize dividend income, taxable to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes), in the amount and as though they had received the cash rather than purchased shares through the distribution reinvestment program. These deemed dividends will be treated as actual dividends and will retain the character and tax effects applicable to all dividends. Shares received under the distribution reinvestment program will have a holding period, for tax purposes, beginning with the day after purchase, and a tax basis equal to their cost, which is the gross amount of the deemed distribution.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates\nThe following critical accounting policies and estimates apply to the Company.\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our combined consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate these judgments, assumptions and estimates for\nchanges that would affect the reported amounts. These estimates are based on management's historical industry experience and on various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these judgments, assumptions and estimates. Our significant judgments, assumptions and estimates include the evaluation and consolidation of variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d), the allocation of the purchase price of acquired properties, the evaluation of our real estate-related investments for impairment, the classification and income recognition for noncontrolling interests and the determination of fair value.\nBasis of Accounting\nThe accompanying combined consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The consolidated balance sheet includes the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Our predecessor combined consolidated financial statements were derived from the historical accounting records of our predecessor and reflect the historical financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods prior to the Spin-Off. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in combination and consolidation. The financial statements of the Company's subsidiaries are prepared using accounting polices consistent with those of the Company. In addition, the Company evaluates relationships with other entities to identify whether there are variable interest entities ( VIE's\u201d) as required by FASB ASC 810, Consolidation, and to assess whether it is the primary beneficiary of such entities. If the determination is made that the Company is the primary beneficiary, then that entity is included in the financial statements in accordance with FASB ASC 810. In the opinion of the Company's management, the accompanying combined consolidated financial statements include all adjustments and eliminations, consisting only of normal recurring items necessary for their fair presentation in conformity with GAAP. There have been no significant changes to the Company's significant accounting policies during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nReal Estate Investments\nUpon acquisition, in accordance with FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations, the purchase price of a property is allocated to land, buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment, and intangible lease assets. The purchase price allocation is based on management's estimate of the property's as-if\u201d vacant fair value, which is calculated by using all available information such as the replacement cost of such asset, appraisals, property condition reports, market data and other related information. The allocation of the purchase price to intangible lease assets represents the value associated with the in-place leases, which may include lost rent, leasing commissions, legal and other related costs, which the Company, as buyer of the property, did not have to incur to obtain the residents.\nIf any debt is assumed in an acquisition, the difference between the fair value and the face value of debt is recorded as a premium or discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt assumed. Costs associated with the acquisition of a property, including acquisition fees paid, are expensed upon closing the acquisition.\nImpairment\nReal estate assets that are determined to be held and used will be reviewed periodically for impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In such cases, the Company will evaluate the recoverability of such real estate assets based on estimated future cash flows and the estimated liquidation value of such real estate assets, and provide for impairment if such undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the real estate asset. If impaired, the real estate asset will be written down to its estimated fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company did not record any impairment charges related to real estate assets.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests are comprised of the Company's joint venture partners' interests in the joint ventures in multifamily properties that the Company combines and consolidates. The Company reports its joint venture partners' interests in its consolidated real estate joint ventures and other subsidiary interests held by third parties as noncontrolling interests. The Company records these noncontrolling interests at their initial fair value, adjusting the basis prospectively for their share of the respective consolidated investment's net income or loss and equity contributions and distributions. These noncontrolling interests are not redeemable by the equity holders and are presented as part of permanent equity. Income and losses are allocated to the noncontrolling interest holder based on its economic ownership percentage.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value measurements are determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy):\nTable 189: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Level 3 inputs are the unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity's own assumption, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on input from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. The Company utilizes an independent third party to perform the allocation of value analysis for each property acquisition and also to perform the market valuations on the interest rate caps and has established policies, as described above, processes and procedures intended to ensure that the valuation methodologies for investments and interest rate caps are fair and consistent as of the measurement date.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates for such new or revised standards. We may elect to comply with public company effective dates at any time, and such election would be irrevocable pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act. The following recent accounting pronouncements reflect effective dates that delay the adoption until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide disclosures when it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption being permitted. The Company will implement the provisions of ASU 2014-15 as of January 1, 2016. The Company does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on its combined consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest, which changes the way reporting enterprises record debt issuance costs. The ASU requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements, which supplements the requirements of ASU 2015-03 by allowing an entity to defer and present debt issuance costs related to a line of credit arrangement as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred costs ratably over the term of the line of credit arrangement. The Company will implement the provisions of ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 as of January 1, 2016. The Company does not expect the new standards to have a material impact on its combined consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, which changes the way reporting enterprises evaluate whether (a) they should consolidate limited partnerships and similar entities, (b) fees paid to a decision maker or service provider are variable interests in a VIE, and (c) variable interests in a VIE held by related parties of the reporting enterprise\nrequire the reporting enterprise to consolidate the VIE. The ASU also significantly changes how to evaluate voting rights for entities that are not similar to limited partnerships when determining whether the entity is a VIE, which may affect entities for which the decision making rights are conveyed though a contractual arrangement. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on its combined consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. An entity should also disclose sufficient quantitative and qualitative information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date, which amends ASU 2014-09 to defer the effective date by one year. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within that reporting period. The Company expects to implement the provisions of ASU 2014-09 as of January 1, 2019. The Company has not yet determined the impact of the new standard on its current policies for revenue recognition.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which changes certain recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The ASU requires all equity investments, except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or resulting in consolidation, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The ASU also simplifies the impairment assessment for equity investments without readily determinable fair values, amends the presentation requirements for changes in the fair value of financial liabilities, requires presentation of financial instruments by measurement category and form of financial asset, and eliminates the requirement to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of financial instruments. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company expects to implement the provisions of ASU 2016-01 as of January 1, 2019, and does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on its combined consolidated financial statements.\nInflation\nThe real estate market has not been affected significantly by inflation in the past several years due to a relatively low inflation rate. The majority of our lease terms are for a period of one year or less and reset to market if renewed. The majority of our leases also contain protection provisions applicable to reimbursement billings for utilities. Should inflation return, due to the short-term nature of our leases, we do not believe our results will be materially affected.\nInflation may also affect the overall cost of debt, as the implied cost of capital increases. Currently, interest rates are less than historical averages. However, if the Federal Reserve institutes new monetary policies, tightening credit in response to or in anticipation of inflation concerns, interest rates could rise. We intend to mitigate these risks through long-term fixed interest rate loans and interest rate hedges, which to date have included interest rate caps.\nREIT Tax Election\nThe Company intends to elect to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) for the 2015 tax year. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax at the corporate level. We are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code, and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a REIT.", "item_7_truncated": "Upon acquisition, in accordance with FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations, the purchase price of a property is allocated to land, buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment, and intangible lease assets.

Other income was $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was an increase of approximately $9.3 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to the acquisition of 10 additional properties. Also, 22 of the 32 properties owned as of December 31, 2014 were acquired during the second half of 2014 and therefore only contributed for less than half of the year in 2014 versus the entire year in 2015. Other income was $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was an increase of approximately $4.6 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to the acquisition of 31 additional properties.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization costs were $40.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was an increase of approximately $19.2 million. The increase for the period was primarily due to the acquisition of 10 additional properties. Also, 22 of the 32 properties owned as of December 31, 2014 were acquired during the second half of 2014 and therefore only contributed for less than half of the year in 2014 versus the entire year in 2015. Depreciation and amortization costs were $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was an increase of approximately $21.5 million. The increase for the period was primarily due to the acquisition of 31 additional properties. The amortization of intangible lease assets over a six-month period from the date of acquisition is also expected to increase the amortization expense during the initial year of operations for each property. For the year ended December 31, 2015, there were 10 new properties with amortizing intangible lease assets and for the year ended December 31, 2014, there were 31 new properties with amortizing intangible lease assets.\nTable 173: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10,992\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (17,533\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (170\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on eminent domain (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (158\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustment for noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,012\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (563\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FFO attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (28\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FFO per share\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.00\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on eminent domain (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of deferred financing costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity-based compensation expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustment for noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (365\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,049\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AFFO attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AFFO per share\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe anticipate incurring average annual repairs and maintenance expense of $575-$725 per unit in connection with the ongoing operations of our business. In addition, we reserve, on average, approximately $250 to $350 per unit for non-recurring capital expenditures and or lender required replacement reserves. Although we will continuously monitor the adequacy of this average, we believe these figures to be sufficient to maintain the properties at a high level in the markets in which we operate. A majority of the properties in our Portfolio were underwritten and acquired with the premise that we would invest $4,000-$10,000 per unit in the first 24-36 months of ownership, in an effort to add value to the asset's exterior and interiors. In most cases, we reserved cash at closing to fund these planned capital expenditures and value-add improvements. As of December 31, 2015, we have reserved approximately $24.5 million for our planned capital expenditures and other expenses to implement our value-add program. The following table sets forth a summary of the Company's capital expenditures related to its value-add program for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nWe intend to invest in additional multifamily properties as suitable opportunities arise and adequate sources of equity and debt financing are available. We expect that future investments in properties, including any improvements or renovations of current or newly-acquired properties, will depend on and will be financed by, in whole or in part, our existing cash, future borrowings and the proceeds from additional issuances of common stock or other securities. In addition, we may seek financing from U.S. government agencies, including through Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD\u201d), in appropriate circumstances in connection with the acquisition or refinancing of existing mortgage loans.\nTable 172: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td>

Rental income was $103.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was an increase of approximately $65.2 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to the acquisition of 10 additional properties. Also, 22 of the 32 properties owned as of December 31, 2014 were acquired during the second half of 2014 and therefore only contributed for less than half of the year in 2014 versus the entire year in 2015. We have also experienced an increase in rental income from our properties based upon increased rents and increased occupancy rates due to the value-add programs that we have implemented as well as organic growth in rents in the markets where these properties are located. Rental income was $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was an increase of approximately $38.3 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to the acquisition of 31 additional properties.\nHowever, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes corporate general and administrative costs, interest expense, interest income and other expense, acquisition costs, certain fees to affiliates, depreciation and amortization expense and gains or losses from the sale of properties, and other gains and losses as stipulated by GAAP, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which are significant economic costs. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of net income which further limits its usefulness.\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rehab Expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interior (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Exterior and common area\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total rehab expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInflation may also affect the overall cost of debt, as the implied cost of capital increases. Currently, interest rates are less than historical averages. However, if the Federal Reserve institutes new monetary policies, tightening credit in response to or in anticipation of inflation concerns, interest rates could rise. We intend to mitigate these risks through long-term fixed interest rate loans and interest rate hedges, which to date have included interest rate caps.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following table reconciles our calculations of FFO and AFFO to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nHistorically, our operations were included in Freedom REIT's U.S. federal and state income tax returns and our operations for 2015 until the Spin-Off will be included in Freedom REIT's U.S. federal and state income tax returns for the taxable year ended December 31, 2015. Freedom REIT elected to be taxed as a REIT beginning with its taxable year ending December 31, 2013 and Freedom REIT has covenanted to us to use its reasonable best efforts to maintain its REIT status for its taxable year ending on December 31, 2015. With respect to its taxable years ending December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014, it distributed 100% of its REIT taxable income and therefore did not owe any U.S. federal income tax. If Freedom REIT fails to qualify as a REIT, it would be subject to U.S. federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on its taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates. In addition, unless we were entitled to relief under certain Code provisions, we also would be disqualified from electing to be taxed as a REIT if Freedom REIT fails to qualify as a REIT for its taxable years ending on or before December 31, 2015 and we are treated as a successor to Freedom REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Although Freedom REIT represented to us that it has no knowledge of any fact or circumstance that would cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT, and covenanted in the agreement between us and our Adviser to use its reasonable best efforts to maintain its REIT status for each of Freedom REIT's taxable years ending on or before December 31, 2015, no assurance can be given that such representation and covenant would prevent us from failing to qualify as a REIT.\nExpenses\nFFO and AFFO\nrequire the reporting enterprise to consolidate the VIE. The ASU also significantly changes how to evaluate voting rights for entities that are not similar to limited partnerships when determining whether the entity is a VIE, which may affect entities for which the decision making rights are conveyed though a contractual arrangement. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on its combined consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. We also believe that funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d), and adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation except on land, such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined by NAREIT as net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and impairment charges. We compute FFO attributable to common stockholders in accordance with NAREIT's definition. Our presentation differs slightly in that we begin with Net Loss before adjusting for noncontrolling interest and show the noncontrolling interest as an adjustment to arrive at FFO attributable to common stockholders. AFFO is calculated by adjusting our FFO by adding back items that do not reflect ongoing property operations, such as acquisition expenses, equity-based compensation expenses, the amortization of deferred loan costs, and the noncontrolling interests related to these items. AFFO will also be adjusted to include any gains (losses) from sales of property to the extent excluded from FFO. We will not have any equity-based compensation expenses unless and until our stockholders approve an amendment to the Company's charter to remove the 1940 Act compliance requirements.\nNoncontrolling interests are comprised of the Company's joint venture partners' interests in the joint ventures in multifamily properties that the Company combines and consolidates. The Company reports its joint venture partners' interests in its consolidated real estate joint ventures and other subsidiary interests held by third parties as noncontrolling interests. The Company records these noncontrolling interests at their initial fair value, adjusting the basis prospectively for their share of the respective consolidated investment's net income or loss and equity contributions and distributions. These noncontrolling interests are not redeemable by the equity holders and are presented as part of permanent equity. Income and losses are allocated to the noncontrolling interest holder based on its economic ownership percentage.\nCash Flows\n \u00b7 advisory fees payable to our Adviser; \nEmerging Growth Company\nA participant may stop participating in the distribution reinvestment program at any time without penalty, by delivering written notice to us. Within 90 days after the end of our fiscal year, we will provide each participant with an individualized report on his or her investment, including the purchase date, purchase price and number of shares owned, as well as the dates of distribution and amount of distributions received during the prior fiscal year. The individualized statement to participants will include receipts and purchases relating to each participant's participation in the distribution reinvestment program including the tax consequences relative thereto.\nThe distribution reinvestment program may purchase fractional shares of common stock, so that 100% of distributions will be used to acquire common stock. Common stock is purchased under the distribution reinvestment program on the record date for the distribution used to purchase the common stock. Distributions on common stock acquired pursuant to the distribution reinvestment program are paid at the same time as distributions are paid on common stock purchased outside the program and are calculated with a daily record and distribution declaration date.\nNet Operating Income\nAs of December 31, 2015, we owned all or a majority interest in a portfolio of multifamily properties, or the Portfolio, primarily located in the Southeastern and Southwestern United States consisting of 42 multifamily properties encompassing 13,155 units of apartment space that was approximately 93.9% leased. The weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit in our Portfolio is $803 as of December 31, 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. An entity should also disclose sufficient quantitative and qualitative information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date, which amends ASU 2014-09 to defer the effective date by one year. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within that reporting period. The Company expects to implement the provisions of ASU 2014-09 as of January 1, 2019. The Company has not yet determined the impact of the new standard on its current policies for revenue recognition.\nRevenues\nWe believe that our available cash, expected operating cash flows and potential debt or equity financings will provide sufficient funds for our operations, anticipated scheduled debt service payments and dividend requirements for the twelve-month period following December 31, 2015.\n \u00b7 recurring maintenance necessary to maintain our multifamily properties; \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which changes certain recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The ASU requires all equity investments, except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or resulting in consolidation, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The ASU also simplifies the impairment assessment for equity investments without readily determinable fair values, amends the presentation requirements for changes in the fair value of financial liabilities, requires presentation of financial instruments by measurement category and form of financial asset, and eliminates the requirement to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of financial instruments. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company expects to implement the provisions of ASU 2016-01 as of January 1, 2019, and does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on its combined consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company has a $29.0 million Bridge Facility payable to Key Bank, N.A., which is recourse to the Company. The Bridge Facility bears interest at an annual rate of 4.00% plus one-month LIBOR. The Bridge Facility is payable in full on August 4, 2016. We are in discussions with Key Bank, N.A. to convert the Bridge Facility to a revolving credit facility or otherwise extend the maturity date, alleviating the necessity to repay the Bridge Facility in full in August 2016. If we are unable to convert the Bridge Facility, we plan to use cash on hand, cash from operations or proceeds from the refinancing of current debt in amounts in excess of the current balances to repay the Bridge Facility.\nWe anticipate that we will qualify to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our first taxable year of operations as a separate public company, and we intend to continue to be organized and to operate in a manner that will permit us to qualify as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on income that we distribute as dividends to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates, and dividends paid to our stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing taxable income. Any resulting corporate liability could be substantial and could materially and adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. Unless we were entitled to relief under certain Code provisions, we also would be disqualified from re-electing to be taxed as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify to be taxed as a REIT.\nThe real estate market has not been affected significantly by inflation in the past several years due to a relatively low inflation rate. The majority of our lease terms are for a period of one year or less and reset to market if renewed. The majority of our leases also contain protection provisions applicable to reimbursement billings for utilities. Should inflation return, due to the short-term nature of our leases, we do not believe our results will be materially affected.\nObligations and Commitments\nCash flows from operating activities. During the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $21.0 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. During the\nCorporate general and administrative expenses. Prior to the completion of the Spin-Off, the Company did not incur any corporate general and administrative costs. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred corporate general and administrative expenses of $2.5 million. Corporate general and administrative expenses may increase in future periods as the Company acquires additional properties. For the year ended December 31, 2015, there were no fees that exceeded the Expense Cap.\nchanges that would affect the reported amounts. These estimates are based on management's historical industry experience and on various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these judgments, assumptions and estimates. Our significant judgments, assumptions and estimates include the evaluation and consolidation of variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d), the allocation of the purchase price of acquired properties, the evaluation of our real estate-related investments for impairment, the classification and income recognition for noncontrolling interests and the determination of fair value.\nRental income. Our earnings are primarily attributable to the rental revenue from our multifamily properties. We anticipate that the leases we enter into for our multifamily properties will typically be for one year or less.\nBasis of Accounting\nyear ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $2.9 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in net cash from operating activities for both periods was mainly due to changes in net loss, depreciation and amortization, and working capital items resulting from the acquisition of additional properties.\nInflation\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013\nIf any debt is assumed in an acquisition, the difference between the fair value and the face value of debt is recorded as a premium or discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt assumed. Costs associated with the acquisition of a property, including acquisition fees paid, are expensed upon closing the acquisition.\nOverview\n \u00b7 Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. \nThe following table presents selected data from the Company's combined consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 (in thousands):\nThe following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations and commitments for the next five years and thereafter as of December 31, 2015. Interest expense due by period on our floating rate debt is based on one-month and three-month LIBOR as of December 31, 2015.\n\n \u00b7 the repayment of the Bridge Facility if we are unable to extend or refinance the Bridge Facility; \n \u00b7 general and administrative expenses; \nCash flows from investing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $268.6 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $637.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash used in investing activities was $637.7 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities for both periods was mainly due to the change in acquisition activity, which varies based on specific acquisition and renovation projects that are ongoing at each respective property. In addition, there is a fluctuation of renovation reserves being established at closing for the value-add programs at each property for each period.\nMortgage Indebtedness\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the Company's operating results for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 (in thousands):\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest, which changes the way reporting enterprises record debt issuance costs. The ASU requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements, which supplements the requirements of ASU 2015-03 by allowing an entity to defer and present debt issuance costs related to a line of credit arrangement as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred costs ratably over the term of the line of credit arrangement. The Company will implement the provisions of ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 as of January 1, 2016. The Company does not expect the new standards to have a material impact on its combined consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our subsidiaries have aggregate mortgage indebtedness to third parties of approximately $682.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding mortgage indebtedness related to the Company was 2.67%. For additional information regarding our mortgage indebtedness, see Note 6 to our combined consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition to our value-add program, our multifamily properties will require periodic capital expenditures and renovation to remain competitive. Also, acquisitions, redevelopments or expansions of our multifamily properties will require significant capital outlays. Long-term, we may not be able to fund such capital improvements solely from net cash provided by operations because we must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deductions for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT, and we are subject to tax on any retained income and gains. As a result, our ability to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions or redevelopment through retained earnings long-term is very limited. Consequently, we expect to rely heavily upon the availability of debt or equity capital for these purposes. If we are unable to obtain the necessary capital on favorable terms, or at all, our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nAdvisory and administrative fees. Advisory and administrative fees include the fees paid to our Adviser pursuant to the Advisory Agreement.\nReal estate taxes and insurance. Real estate taxes include the property taxes assessed by local and state authorities depending on the location of each property. Insurance includes the cost of commercial, general liability, and other needed insurance for each property.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our multifamily properties, including:\nProperty general and administrative expenses. Property general and administrative expenses include the costs of marketing, professional fees, general office supplies, and other administrative related costs of each property.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization costs primarily include depreciation of our multifamily properties and amortization of acquired in-place leases.\nNet Operating Income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. NOI is used by investors and our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties to other comparable properties, to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of our properties as NOI is not affected by (1) the cost of funds, (2) acquisition costs, (3) non-operating fees to affiliates, (4) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP, (5) corporate general and administrative expenses, (6) other gains and losses that are specific to us, and (7) entity level general and administrative expenses that are either non-recurring in nature or incurred on behalf of the Company at the property level for expenses such as legal, professional and franchise tax fees.\nThe Company began operations on March 31, 2015 as a result of the transfer and contribution by NexPoint Credit Strategies Fund ( NHF\u201d) of all but one of the multifamily properties owned by NHF through NHF's subsidiary Freedom REIT, LLC ( Freedom REIT\u201d) in exchange for 100% of its outstanding common stock. We use the term predecessor\u201d to mean the carve-out business of Freedom REIT, which owned all or a majority interest in the multifamily properties transferred or contributed to the Company by NHF through Freedom REIT. On March 31, 2015, NHF distributed all of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock held by NHF to holders of NHF common shares. We refer to the distribution of our common stock by NHF as the Spin-Off.\u201d Substantially all of our operations were conducted by our predecessor prior to March 31, 2015. With the exception of a nominal amount of initial cash funded at inception, the Company did not own any assets prior to March 31, 2015. Our predecessor included all of the properties in our portfolio that were held indirectly by Freedom REIT prior to the Spin-Off. Our predecessor was determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d). References throughout this report to the Company,\u201d we,\u201d or our,\u201d include the activity of the predecessor defined above.\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates for such new or revised standards. We may elect to comply with public company effective dates at any time, and such election would be irrevocable pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act. The following recent accounting pronouncements reflect effective dates that delay the adoption until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and our historical results of operations. The following should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those projected, forecasted or expected in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those which are discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d in this annual report. Our management believes the assumptions underlying the Company's Financial Statements and accompanying notes are reasonable. However, the Company's Financial Statements may not necessarily reflect our financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nWe intend to make regular quarterly dividend payments to holders of our common stock. U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100% of its taxable income. We intend to make regular quarterly dividend payments of all or substantially all of our taxable income to holders of our common stock out of assets legally available for this purpose, if and to the extent authorized by our Board. Before we make any dividend payments, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating requirements and debt service on our debt payable. If our cash available for distribution is less than our taxable income, we could be required to sell assets, borrow funds or raise additional capital to make cash dividends or we may make a portion of the required dividend in the form of a taxable distribution of stock or debt securities.\nExpenses\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe change in the Company's FFO and AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to FFO and AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily relates to the Company acquiring, owning and operating an additional 10 properties for a total of 42 properties as of December 31, 2015, as compared to acquiring, owning and operating 32 properties as of December 31, 2014. Also, 22 of the 32 properties owned as of December 31, 2014 were acquired during the second half of 2014 and therefore only contributed for less than half of the year in 2014 versus the entire year in 2015. Additionally, the increases in FFO and AFFO reflect increased Same Store revenues, net of increases in Same Store expenses. The change in the Company's FFO and AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to FFO and AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily relates to the Company acquiring, owning and operating an additional 31 properties for a total of 32 properties as of December 31, 2014, as compared to acquiring, owning and operating one property as of December 31, 2013.\nStockholders who participate in the distribution reinvestment program will recognize dividend income, taxable to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes), in the amount and as though they had received the cash rather than purchased shares through the distribution reinvestment program. These deemed dividends will be treated as actual dividends and will retain the character and tax effects applicable to all dividends. Shares received under the distribution reinvestment program will have a holding period, for tax purposes, beginning with the day after purchase, and a tax basis equal to their cost, which is the gross amount of the deemed distribution.\nReal estate taxes and insurance. Real estate taxes and insurance costs were $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was an increase of approximately $9.5 million. The increase for the period was primarily due to the acquisition of 10 additional properties. Also, 22 of the 32 properties owned as of December 31, 2014 were acquired during the second half of 2014 and therefore only contributed for less than half of the year in 2014 versus the entire year in 2015. Real estate taxes and insurance costs were $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was an increase of approximately $5.7 million. The increase for the period was primarily due to the acquisition of 31 additional properties. Further, the costs for property taxes incurred in the first year of ownership may be significantly less than subsequent years since the purchase price of the property may trigger a significant increase in assessed value by the taxing authority in subsequent years, increasing the costs of real estate taxes.\nThe accompanying combined consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The consolidated balance sheet includes the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Our predecessor combined consolidated financial statements were derived from the historical accounting records of our predecessor and reflect the historical financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods prior to the Spin-Off. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in combination and consolidation. The financial statements of the Company's subsidiaries are prepared using accounting polices consistent with those of the Company. In addition, the Company evaluates relationships with other entities to identify whether there are variable interest entities ( VIE's\u201d) as required by FASB ASC 810, Consolidation, and to assess whether it is the primary beneficiary of such entities. If the determination is made that the Company is the primary beneficiary, then that entity is included in the financial statements in accordance with FASB ASC 810. In the opinion of the Company's management, the accompanying combined consolidated financial statements include all adjustments and eliminations, consisting only of normal recurring items necessary for their fair presentation in conformity with GAAP. There have been no significant changes to the Company's significant accounting policies during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAcquisition costs. Acquisition costs were $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was a decrease of approximately $5.6 million. The decrease between the periods was due to the lower level of acquisitions completed during the period. Acquisition costs were $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was an increase of approximately $8.5 million. The increase between the periods was due to the higher level of acquisitions completed during the period. Acquisition costs depend on the specific circumstances of each closing and are one-time costs associated with each acquisition.\n (1) On August 4, 2015, the Department of Transportation of the State of Georgia ( DOT\u201d), through exercise of eminent domain, appropriated 0.966 acres of land and certain access rights from The Crossings in Marietta, GA and paid the sum of approximately $0.3 million as just and adequate compensation. The Company recognized a gain on eminent domain of approximately $0.2 million. Due to immateriality, the gain on eminent domain was included in other income for the year ended December 31, 2015. \nCapital Expenditures and Value-Add Program\nThe directors, including a majority of independent directors, by majority vote may amend or terminate the distribution reinvestment program upon 10 days' notice to participants.\nIncome Taxes\n \u00b7 Level 3 inputs are the unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity's own assumption, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on input from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. \nEach property has a separate non-recourse mortgage which is secured only by that property. These non-recourse mortgages have standard scope non-recourse carve outs required by agency lenders and generally call for protection by the borrower and the guarantor against losses by the lender for so-called bad acts,\u201d such as misrepresentations, and may include full recourse liability for more significant events such as bankruptcy. We and our property manager, BH, and its affiliates, provided non-recourse carve out guarantees for the mortgage indebtedness currently outstanding relating to the Portfolio.\nProperty general and administrative expenses. Property general and administrative costs were $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was an increase of approximately $3.3 million. The increase for the period was primarily due to the acquisition of 10 additional properties. Also, 22 of the 32 properties owned as of December 31, 2014 were acquired during the second half of 2014 and therefore only contributed for less than half of the year in 2014 versus the entire year in 2015. Property general and administrative costs were $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was an increase of approximately $2.1 million. The increase for the period was primarily due to the acquisition of 31 additional properties.\nWe could remain an emerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of becoming a public company, (2) the last day of the first fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1 billion or more, (3) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act (which would occur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million, measured as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and we have been publicly reporting for at least 12 months) or (4) the date on which we have, during the preceding three year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt.\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates\nWe will make dividend payments based on our estimate of taxable earnings per share of common stock, but not earnings calculated pursuant to GAAP. Our dividends and taxable income and GAAP earnings will typically differ due to items such as depreciation and amortization, fair value adjustments, differences in premium amortization and discount accretion, and non-deductible general and administrative expenses. Our quarterly dividends per share may be substantially different than our quarterly taxable earnings and GAAP earnings per share. The Board declared the Company's third quarterly dividend of $0.206 per share on November 10, 2015, which was paid on December 31, 2015 and funded out of operations.\nFair value measurements are determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy):\nREIT Tax Election\nWe believe that the use of FFO and AFFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO and AFFO to be useful measures for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, impairment charges and real estate depreciation and amortization, and, for AFFO, by excluding non-cash expenses such as acquisition expenses, equity-based compensation expenses and the amortization of deferred loan costs, FFO and AFFO can help investors compare our operating performance between periods and to other REITs. While FFO and AFFO are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of REITs, they do not represent cash flows from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO and AFFO do not purport to be indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to FFO and AFFO reported by other REITs that do not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition or define AFFO differently than we do.\nWe expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and existing cash balances. As of December 31, 2015, we have reserved approximately $24.5 million for our planned capital expenditures to implement our value-add program.\n\nCompany-specific Indebtedness\nProperty management fees. Property management fees were $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was an increase of approximately $2.2 million. The increase for the period was primarily due to the acquisition of 10 additional properties. Also, 22 of the 32 properties owned as of December 31, 2014 were acquired during the second half of 2014 and therefore only contributed for less than half of the year in 2014 versus the entire year in\nDividends\nProperty operating expenses. Property operating costs were $34.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was an increase of approximately $22.0 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to the acquisition of 10 additional properties. Also, 22 of the 32 properties owned as of December 31, 2014 were acquired during the second half of 2014 and therefore only contributed for less than half of the year in 2014 versus the entire year in 2015. Property operating costs were $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was an increase of approximately $12.2 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to the acquisition of 31 additional properties.\n \u00b7 administrative fees payable to our Adviser; \nFair Value Measurements\nImpairment\nProperty operating expenses. Property operating expenses include property maintenance costs, salary and employee benefit costs, utilities and other property operating costs.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAlthough we expect to be subject to restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, we expect that we will be able to refinance existing indebtedness or incur additional indebtedness for acquisitions or other purposes, if needed. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness, incur additional indebtedness or access additional sources of capital, such as by issuing common stock or other debt or equity securities, on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.\n \u00b7 Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. \nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, which changes the way reporting enterprises evaluate whether (a) they should consolidate limited partnerships and similar entities, (b) fees paid to a decision maker or service provider are variable interests in a VIE, and (c) variable interests in a VIE held by related parties of the reporting enterprise\n \u00b7 distributions necessary to qualify for taxation as a REIT; \nNOI is a measure of the operating performance of our properties but does not measure our performance as a whole. NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income (loss) as computed in accordance with GAAP. This measure should be analyzed in conjunction with net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP and discussions elsewhere in -Results of Operations\u201d regarding the components of net income (loss) that are eliminated in the calculation of NOI. Other companies may use different methods for calculating NOI or similarly entitled measures and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies that do not define the measure exactly as we do.\n\nComponents of Our Revenues and Expenses\nThe Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. The Company utilizes an independent third party to perform the allocation of value analysis for each property acquisition and also to perform the market valuations on the interest rate caps and has established policies, as described above, processes and procedures intended to ensure that the valuation methodologies for investments and interest rate caps are fair and consistent as of the measurement date.\n \u00b7 capital expenditures to complete our value-add program and to improve the quality and performance of our multifamily properties; \n\n\nThe changes in the Company's overall cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily relate to the Company acquiring, owning and operating an additional 10 properties for a total of 42 properties as of December 31, 2015 as compared to acquiring, owning and operating 32 properties as of December 31, 2014. Also, 22 of the 32 properties owned as of December 31, 2014 were acquired during the second half of 2014 and therefore only contributed for less than half of the year in 2014 versus the entire year in 2015. The changes in the Company's overall cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily relate to the Company acquiring, owning and operating an additional 31 properties for a total of 32 properties as of December 31, 2014 as compared to acquiring, owning and operating one property as of December 31, 2013.\nOur long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the costs of acquiring additional multifamily properties, renovations and other capital expenditures to improve our multifamily properties and scheduled debt payments and distributions. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, which may include a revolving credit facility and future debt or equity issuances, existing working capital, net cash provided by operations, long-term mortgage indebtedness and other secured and unsecured borrowings. However, there are a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to access these capital sources, including the state of overall equity and credit markets, our degree of leverage, our unencumbered asset base and borrowing restrictions imposed by lenders (including as a result of any failure to comply with financial covenants in our existing and future indebtedness), general market conditions for REITs, our operating performance and liquidity and market perceptions about us. The success of our business strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to access these various capital sources.\nInterest expense. Interest expense costs were $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was an increase of approximately $11.2 million. The increase for the period was primarily due to the acquisition of 10 additional properties. Also, 22 of the 32 properties owned as of December 31, 2014 were acquired during the second half of 2014 and therefore only contributed for less than half of the year in 2014 versus the entire year in 2015. There were no interest expense costs for the year ended December 31, 2013. The following is a table that details the various costs included in interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 (in thousands):\nAcquisition costs. Acquisition costs include the costs to acquire additional properties.\nInterest expense. Interest expense primarily includes the cost of interest expense on debt, the amortization of deferred financing costs, and the fair value adjustments on interest rate caps that are not designated as hedges.\n \u00b7 interest expense and scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness (see -Obligations and Commitments\u201d); \nThe change in the Company's operating results for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the operating results for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily relates to the Company acquiring, owning and operating an additional 10 properties for a total of 42 properties as of December 31, 2015 as compared to acquiring, owning and operating 32 properties as of December 31, 2014, as well as increases in same store operating results. The change in the Company's operating results for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the operating results for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily relates to the Company acquiring, owning and operating an additional 31 properties for a total of 32 properties as of December 31, 2014 as compared to acquiring, owning and operating one property as of December 31, 2013.\nThe following table, which has not been adjusted for the effects of any noncontrolling interests, details our net operating income for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 (in thousands):\nThe following critical accounting policies and estimates apply to the Company.\n\nCorporate general and administrative expenses. Corporate general and administrative expenses include but are not limited to payments of reimbursements to the Adviser, audit fees, legal fees, listing fees, board of director fees, and investor relation costs. The reimbursement of Adviser Operating Expenses, administrative fees and the advisory fees paid to our Adviser (including advisory and administrative fees on New Assets) will not exceed 1.5% of Average Real Estate Assets per calendar year (or part thereof that the Advisory Agreement is in effect), or the Expense Cap\u201d. The Expense Cap does not limit the reimbursement by the Company of expenses related to securities offerings paid by the Adviser. The Expense Cap also does not apply to legal, accounting, financial, due diligence and other service fees incurred in connection with mergers and acquisitions, extraordinary litigation or other events outside the Company's ordinary course of business or any out-of-pocket acquisition or due diligence expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition or disposition of real estate assets.\nWe are primarily focused on directly or indirectly acquiring, owning, and operating well-located multifamily properties with a value-add component in large cities and suburban submarkets of large cities, primarily in the Southeastern and Southwestern United States. We generate revenue primarily by leasing our multifamily properties. We intend to employ management and capex value-add programs at a majority of our properties in an attempt to improve rental rates and the net operating income at our properties. We are externally managed by NexPoint Real Estate Advisors L.P., or our Adviser, an affiliate of Highland Capital Management, L.P. (our Sponsor\u201d or Highland\u201d), a leading global alternative asset manager and an SEC-registered investment adviser which, together with its affiliates, had approximately $18.3 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2015.\nAt the time of the Spin-Off, which occurred on March 31, 2015, the Company owned all or a majority interest in a portfolio of 38 multifamily properties. Following the Spin-Off, the Company acquired one property in April 2015, two properties in August 2015, and one property in October 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the Company owned all or a majority interest in a portfolio of multifamily properties, or the Portfolio, primarily located in the Southeastern and Southwestern United States, consisting of 42 multifamily properties encompassing 13,155 units of apartment space that was approximately 93.9% leased. The weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit in our Portfolio is $803 as of December 31, 2015.\nWe intend to elect to be taxed and qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our 2015 tax year. To maintain REIT status, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains.\nShares for the distribution reinvestment program are acquired from the exchange or market on which our shares are listed at the prevailing market price. If we use the services of a broker to acquire shares of our common stock in connection with the distribution reinvestment program, we will allocate the costs of such broker among all of the participants in the program. We will not charge these investors for any fees other than the actual third-party out-of-pocket expenses that we incur. Neither we, nor our Adviser, nor our affiliates receives a fee for managing the distribution reinvestment program. We do not warrant or guarantee that participants will acquire shares at the lowest possible price through the program.\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates for such new or revised standards. We may elect to comply with public company effective dates at any time, and such election would be irrevocable pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act.\nThe cost of funds is eliminated from net income (loss) because it is specific to our particular financing capabilities and constraints. The cost of funds is also eliminated because it is dependent on historical interest rates and other costs of capital as well as past decisions made by us regarding the appropriate mix of capital which may have changed or may change in the future. Acquisition costs and non-operating fees to affiliates are eliminated because they do not reflect continuing operating costs of the property owner. Depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets are eliminated because they may not accurately represent the actual change in value in our multifamily properties that result from use of the properties or changes in market conditions. While certain aspects of real property do decline in value over time in a manner that is reasonably captured by depreciation and amortization, the value of the properties as a whole have historically increased or decreased as a result of changes in overall economic conditions instead of from actual use of the property or the passage of time. Gains and losses from the sale of real property vary from property to property and are affected by market conditions at the time of sale which will usually change from period to period. Entity level general and administrative are eliminated as they are specific to the way in which we have chosen to hold our properties and are the result of our joint venture ownership structuring. Also, non-recurring expenses that are incurred upon acquisition of a property do not reflect continuing operating costs of the property owner. These gains and losses can create distortions when comparing one period to another or when comparing our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies that have not made similarly timed purchases or sales. We believe that eliminating these costs from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual ongoing revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating our properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.\n (1) Includes total capital expenditures during the period on completed and in-progress interior rehabs. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we completed full and partial interior rehabs on 2,313 and 330 units, respectively. \n2015. Property management fees were $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was an increase of approximately $1.3 million. The increase for the period was primarily due to the acquisition of 31 additional properties.\n\nFurthermore, following the completion of our value-add and capital expenditures programs and depending on the interest rate environment at the applicable time, we may seek to refinance our floating rate debt into longer-term fixed rate debt at lower leverage levels.\nOther income. Other income includes ancillary income earned from tenants such as application fees, late fees, laundry fees, utility reimbursements, and other rental related fees charged to tenants.\nWe entered into and expect to continue to enter into interest rate cap agreements with various third parties to cap the variable interest rates on a majority of our outstanding mortgage indebtedness. These agreements generally have a term of three to four years and cover the outstanding principal amount of the underlying indebtedness. Under these agreements, we pay a fixed fee in exchange for the counterparty to pay any interest above a maximum rate. At December 31, 2015, interest rate cap agreements covered $577.9 million of the $636.8 million of total outstanding floating rate mortgage indebtedness relating to the Company. These interest rate cap agreements cap the related variable interest rates of our mortgage indebtedness at a weighted average interest rate of 5.99% as of December 31, 2015. Three mortgages totaling $58.9 million did not have caps associated with them as of December 31, 2015.\nAdvisory and administrative fees. Advisory and administrative fees were $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was an increase of approximately $3.9 million. The increase for the period was due to the acquisition of 10 additional properties, seven of which are defined as Contributed Assets and three of which are defined as New Assets pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, which increases the basis on which the fee is earned. Following the Spin-Off, the amount paid in 2015 represents the maximum fee allowed on Contributed Assets under the Advisory Agreement plus approximately $0.2 million of advisory and administrative fees incurred on Madera Point, The Pointe at the Foothills, and The Place at Vanderbilt, defined as New Assets pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, for the three months ended December 31, 2015. Advisory and administrative fees were $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was an increase of approximately $1.7 million. The increase for the period was due to the acquisition of 31 additional properties. Advisory and administrative fees may increase in future periods as the Company acquires additional properties.\n \u00b7 property management fees payable to BH. \nOn October 21, 2015, the Company refinanced the $13.1 million existing fixed rate HUD loan on Regatta Bay with a $14.0 million, full-term interest only, floating rate loan that has an interest rate equal to three-month LIBOR (subject to a floor of 0.25%) plus 1.70%. The Company incurred a 5.0% pre-payment penalty of approximately $0.7 million on the refinancing, received approximately $0.3 million in net proceeds from the new loan, and will realize annual savings of approximately $0.4 million based on three-month LIBOR as of December 31, 2015. The new loan matures on November 1, 2020 and can be pre-paid in the first 12 months of the term at par plus 1.00% and at par thereafter.\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our combined consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate these judgments, assumptions and estimates for\nRevenues\nNOI for the Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013\nThe Company intends to elect to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) for the 2015 tax year. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax at the corporate level. We are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code, and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a REIT.\nReal Estate Investments\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide disclosures when it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption being permitted. The Company will implement the provisions of ASU 2014-15 as of January 1, 2016. The Company does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on its combined consolidated financial statements.\nDistribution Reinvestment Program\nCash flows from financing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $251.1 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $647.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities for the period was mainly due to the level of activity related to the debt funded on the respective property closings and capital contributed at each closing. During the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was $647.3 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities for the period was mainly due to the level of activity related to the debt funded on the respective property closings and capital contributed at each closing.", "item_7_text": "Upon acquisition, in accordance with FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations, the purchase price of a property is allocated to land, buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment, and intangible lease assets. The purchase price allocation is based on management's estimate of the property's as-if\u201d vacant fair value, which is calculated by using all available information such as the replacement cost of such asset, appraisals, property condition reports, market data and other related information. The allocation of the purchase price to intangible lease assets represents the value associated with the in-place leases, which may include lost rent, leasing commissions, legal and other related costs, which the Company, as buyer of the property, did not have to incur to obtain the residents.\nOur distribution reinvestment program provides our stockholders with an opportunity to acquire additional shares of common stock by reinvesting distributions. Stockholders who elect to participate in the distribution reinvestment program authorize us to use distributions payable to them to acquire additional shares of common stock. A participant is not able to acquire common stock under the program if the purchase would cause the participant to exceed the 6.2% ownership limit or would violate any of the other stock ownership restrictions imposed by our charter or securities laws.\n \u00b7 reimbursements to our Adviser; and \nNoncontrolling Interests\nProperty management fees. Property management fees include fees paid to BH or other third party management companies for managing each property.\nReal estate assets that are determined to be held and used will be reviewed periodically for impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In such cases, the Company will evaluate the recoverability of such real estate assets based on estimated future cash flows and the estimated liquidation value of such real estate assets, and provide for impairment if such undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the real estate asset. If impaired, the real estate asset will be written down to its estimated fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company did not record any impairment charges related to real estate assets.\nOther income. Other income was $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was an increase of approximately $9.3 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to the acquisition of 10 additional properties. Also, 22 of the 32 properties owned as of December 31, 2014 were acquired during the second half of 2014 and therefore only contributed for less than half of the year in 2014 versus the entire year in 2015. Other income was $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was an increase of approximately $4.6 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to the acquisition of 31 additional properties.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization costs were $40.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was an increase of approximately $19.2 million. The increase for the period was primarily due to the acquisition of 10 additional properties. Also, 22 of the 32 properties owned as of December 31, 2014 were acquired during the second half of 2014 and therefore only contributed for less than half of the year in 2014 versus the entire year in 2015. Depreciation and amortization costs were $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was an increase of approximately $21.5 million. The increase for the period was primarily due to the acquisition of 31 additional properties. The amortization of intangible lease assets over a six-month period from the date of acquisition is also expected to increase the amortization expense during the initial year of operations for each property. For the year ended December 31, 2015, there were 10 new properties with amortizing intangible lease assets and for the year ended December 31, 2014, there were 31 new properties with amortizing intangible lease assets.\nWe anticipate incurring average annual repairs and maintenance expense of $575-$725 per unit in connection with the ongoing operations of our business. In addition, we reserve, on average, approximately $250 to $350 per unit for non-recurring capital expenditures and or lender required replacement reserves. Although we will continuously monitor the adequacy of this average, we believe these figures to be sufficient to maintain the properties at a high level in the markets in which we operate. A majority of the properties in our Portfolio were underwritten and acquired with the premise that we would invest $4,000-$10,000 per unit in the first 24-36 months of ownership, in an effort to add value to the asset's exterior and interiors. In most cases, we reserved cash at closing to fund these planned capital expenditures and value-add improvements. As of December 31, 2015, we have reserved approximately $24.5 million for our planned capital expenditures and other expenses to implement our value-add program. The following table sets forth a summary of the Company's capital expenditures related to its value-add program for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nWe intend to invest in additional multifamily properties as suitable opportunities arise and adequate sources of equity and debt financing are available. We expect that future investments in properties, including any improvements or renovations of current or newly-acquired properties, will depend on and will be financed by, in whole or in part, our existing cash, future borrowings and the proceeds from additional issuances of common stock or other securities. In addition, we may seek financing from U.S. government agencies, including through Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD\u201d), in appropriate circumstances in connection with the acquisition or refinancing of existing mortgage loans.\nNon-GAAP Measurements\nRental income. Rental income was $103.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was an increase of approximately $65.2 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to the acquisition of 10 additional properties. Also, 22 of the 32 properties owned as of December 31, 2014 were acquired during the second half of 2014 and therefore only contributed for less than half of the year in 2014 versus the entire year in 2015. We have also experienced an increase in rental income from our properties based upon increased rents and increased occupancy rates due to the value-add programs that we have implemented as well as organic growth in rents in the markets where these properties are located. Rental income was $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was an increase of approximately $38.3 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to the acquisition of 31 additional properties.\nHowever, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes corporate general and administrative costs, interest expense, interest income and other expense, acquisition costs, certain fees to affiliates, depreciation and amortization expense and gains or losses from the sale of properties, and other gains and losses as stipulated by GAAP, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which are significant economic costs. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of net income which further limits its usefulness.\nInflation may also affect the overall cost of debt, as the implied cost of capital increases. Currently, interest rates are less than historical averages. However, if the Federal Reserve institutes new monetary policies, tightening credit in response to or in anticipation of inflation concerns, interest rates could rise. We intend to mitigate these risks through long-term fixed interest rate loans and interest rate hedges, which to date have included interest rate caps.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following table reconciles our calculations of FFO and AFFO to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nHistorically, our operations were included in Freedom REIT's U.S. federal and state income tax returns and our operations for 2015 until the Spin-Off will be included in Freedom REIT's U.S. federal and state income tax returns for the taxable year ended December 31, 2015. Freedom REIT elected to be taxed as a REIT beginning with its taxable year ending December 31, 2013 and Freedom REIT has covenanted to us to use its reasonable best efforts to maintain its REIT status for its taxable year ending on December 31, 2015. With respect to its taxable years ending December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014, it distributed 100% of its REIT taxable income and therefore did not owe any U.S. federal income tax. If Freedom REIT fails to qualify as a REIT, it would be subject to U.S. federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on its taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates. In addition, unless we were entitled to relief under certain Code provisions, we also would be disqualified from electing to be taxed as a REIT if Freedom REIT fails to qualify as a REIT for its taxable years ending on or before December 31, 2015 and we are treated as a successor to Freedom REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Although Freedom REIT represented to us that it has no knowledge of any fact or circumstance that would cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT, and covenanted in the agreement between us and our Adviser to use its reasonable best efforts to maintain its REIT status for each of Freedom REIT's taxable years ending on or before December 31, 2015, no assurance can be given that such representation and covenant would prevent us from failing to qualify as a REIT.\nExpenses\nFFO and AFFO\nrequire the reporting enterprise to consolidate the VIE. The ASU also significantly changes how to evaluate voting rights for entities that are not similar to limited partnerships when determining whether the entity is a VIE, which may affect entities for which the decision making rights are conveyed though a contractual arrangement. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on its combined consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. We also believe that funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d), and adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation except on land, such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined by NAREIT as net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and impairment charges. We compute FFO attributable to common stockholders in accordance with NAREIT's definition. Our presentation differs slightly in that we begin with Net Loss before adjusting for noncontrolling interest and show the noncontrolling interest as an adjustment to arrive at FFO attributable to common stockholders. AFFO is calculated by adjusting our FFO by adding back items that do not reflect ongoing property operations, such as acquisition expenses, equity-based compensation expenses, the amortization of deferred loan costs, and the noncontrolling interests related to these items. AFFO will also be adjusted to include any gains (losses) from sales of property to the extent excluded from FFO. We will not have any equity-based compensation expenses unless and until our stockholders approve an amendment to the Company's charter to remove the 1940 Act compliance requirements.\nNoncontrolling interests are comprised of the Company's joint venture partners' interests in the joint ventures in multifamily properties that the Company combines and consolidates. The Company reports its joint venture partners' interests in its consolidated real estate joint ventures and other subsidiary interests held by third parties as noncontrolling interests. The Company records these noncontrolling interests at their initial fair value, adjusting the basis prospectively for their share of the respective consolidated investment's net income or loss and equity contributions and distributions. These noncontrolling interests are not redeemable by the equity holders and are presented as part of permanent equity. Income and losses are allocated to the noncontrolling interest holder based on its economic ownership percentage.\nCash Flows\n \u00b7 advisory fees payable to our Adviser; \nEmerging Growth Company\nA participant may stop participating in the distribution reinvestment program at any time without penalty, by delivering written notice to us. Within 90 days after the end of our fiscal year, we will provide each participant with an individualized report on his or her investment, including the purchase date, purchase price and number of shares owned, as well as the dates of distribution and amount of distributions received during the prior fiscal year. The individualized statement to participants will include receipts and purchases relating to each participant's participation in the distribution reinvestment program including the tax consequences relative thereto.\nThe distribution reinvestment program may purchase fractional shares of common stock, so that 100% of distributions will be used to acquire common stock. Common stock is purchased under the distribution reinvestment program on the record date for the distribution used to purchase the common stock. Distributions on common stock acquired pursuant to the distribution reinvestment program are paid at the same time as distributions are paid on common stock purchased outside the program and are calculated with a daily record and distribution declaration date.\nNet Operating Income\nAs of December 31, 2015, we owned all or a majority interest in a portfolio of multifamily properties, or the Portfolio, primarily located in the Southeastern and Southwestern United States consisting of 42 multifamily properties encompassing 13,155 units of apartment space that was approximately 93.9% leased. The weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit in our Portfolio is $803 as of December 31, 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. An entity should also disclose sufficient quantitative and qualitative information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date, which amends ASU 2014-09 to defer the effective date by one year. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within that reporting period. The Company expects to implement the provisions of ASU 2014-09 as of January 1, 2019. The Company has not yet determined the impact of the new standard on its current policies for revenue recognition.\nRevenues\nWe believe that our available cash, expected operating cash flows and potential debt or equity financings will provide sufficient funds for our operations, anticipated scheduled debt service payments and dividend requirements for the twelve-month period following December 31, 2015.\n \u00b7 recurring maintenance necessary to maintain our multifamily properties; \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which changes certain recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The ASU requires all equity investments, except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or resulting in consolidation, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The ASU also simplifies the impairment assessment for equity investments without readily determinable fair values, amends the presentation requirements for changes in the fair value of financial liabilities, requires presentation of financial instruments by measurement category and form of financial asset, and eliminates the requirement to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of financial instruments. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company expects to implement the provisions of ASU 2016-01 as of January 1, 2019, and does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on its combined consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company has a $29.0 million Bridge Facility payable to Key Bank, N.A., which is recourse to the Company. The Bridge Facility bears interest at an annual rate of 4.00% plus one-month LIBOR. The Bridge Facility is payable in full on August 4, 2016. We are in discussions with Key Bank, N.A. to convert the Bridge Facility to a revolving credit facility or otherwise extend the maturity date, alleviating the necessity to repay the Bridge Facility in full in August 2016. If we are unable to convert the Bridge Facility, we plan to use cash on hand, cash from operations or proceeds from the refinancing of current debt in amounts in excess of the current balances to repay the Bridge Facility.\nWe anticipate that we will qualify to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our first taxable year of operations as a separate public company, and we intend to continue to be organized and to operate in a manner that will permit us to qualify as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on income that we distribute as dividends to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates, and dividends paid to our stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing taxable income. Any resulting corporate liability could be substantial and could materially and adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. Unless we were entitled to relief under certain Code provisions, we also would be disqualified from re-electing to be taxed as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify to be taxed as a REIT.\nThe real estate market has not been affected significantly by inflation in the past several years due to a relatively low inflation rate. The majority of our lease terms are for a period of one year or less and reset to market if renewed. The majority of our leases also contain protection provisions applicable to reimbursement billings for utilities. Should inflation return, due to the short-term nature of our leases, we do not believe our results will be materially affected.\nObligations and Commitments\nCash flows from operating activities. During the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $21.0 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. During the\nCorporate general and administrative expenses. Prior to the completion of the Spin-Off, the Company did not incur any corporate general and administrative costs. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred corporate general and administrative expenses of $2.5 million. Corporate general and administrative expenses may increase in future periods as the Company acquires additional properties. For the year ended December 31, 2015, there were no fees that exceeded the Expense Cap.\nchanges that would affect the reported amounts. These estimates are based on management's historical industry experience and on various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these judgments, assumptions and estimates. Our significant judgments, assumptions and estimates include the evaluation and consolidation of variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d), the allocation of the purchase price of acquired properties, the evaluation of our real estate-related investments for impairment, the classification and income recognition for noncontrolling interests and the determination of fair value.\nRental income. Our earnings are primarily attributable to the rental revenue from our multifamily properties. We anticipate that the leases we enter into for our multifamily properties will typically be for one year or less.\nBasis of Accounting\nyear ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $2.9 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in net cash from operating activities for both periods was mainly due to changes in net loss, depreciation and amortization, and working capital items resulting from the acquisition of additional properties.\nInflation\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013\nIf any debt is assumed in an acquisition, the difference between the fair value and the face value of debt is recorded as a premium or discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt assumed. Costs associated with the acquisition of a property, including acquisition fees paid, are expensed upon closing the acquisition.\nOverview\n \u00b7 Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. \nThe following table presents selected data from the Company's combined consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 (in thousands):\nThe following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations and commitments for the next five years and thereafter as of December 31, 2015. Interest expense due by period on our floating rate debt is based on one-month and three-month LIBOR as of December 31, 2015.\n\n \u00b7 the repayment of the Bridge Facility if we are unable to extend or refinance the Bridge Facility; \n \u00b7 general and administrative expenses; \nCash flows from investing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $268.6 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $637.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash used in investing activities was $637.7 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities for both periods was mainly due to the change in acquisition activity, which varies based on specific acquisition and renovation projects that are ongoing at each respective property. In addition, there is a fluctuation of renovation reserves being established at closing for the value-add programs at each property for each period.\nMortgage Indebtedness\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the Company's operating results for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 (in thousands):\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest, which changes the way reporting enterprises record debt issuance costs. The ASU requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements, which supplements the requirements of ASU 2015-03 by allowing an entity to defer and present debt issuance costs related to a line of credit arrangement as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred costs ratably over the term of the line of credit arrangement. The Company will implement the provisions of ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 as of January 1, 2016. The Company does not expect the new standards to have a material impact on its combined consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our subsidiaries have aggregate mortgage indebtedness to third parties of approximately $682.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding mortgage indebtedness related to the Company was 2.67%. For additional information regarding our mortgage indebtedness, see Note 6 to our combined consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition to our value-add program, our multifamily properties will require periodic capital expenditures and renovation to remain competitive. Also, acquisitions, redevelopments or expansions of our multifamily properties will require significant capital outlays. Long-term, we may not be able to fund such capital improvements solely from net cash provided by operations because we must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deductions for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT, and we are subject to tax on any retained income and gains. As a result, our ability to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions or redevelopment through retained earnings long-term is very limited. Consequently, we expect to rely heavily upon the availability of debt or equity capital for these purposes. If we are unable to obtain the necessary capital on favorable terms, or at all, our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nAdvisory and administrative fees. Advisory and administrative fees include the fees paid to our Adviser pursuant to the Advisory Agreement.\nReal estate taxes and insurance. Real estate taxes include the property taxes assessed by local and state authorities depending on the location of each property. Insurance includes the cost of commercial, general liability, and other needed insurance for each property.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our multifamily properties, including:\nProperty general and administrative expenses. Property general and administrative expenses include the costs of marketing, professional fees, general office supplies, and other administrative related costs of each property.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization costs primarily include depreciation of our multifamily properties and amortization of acquired in-place leases.\nNet Operating Income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. NOI is used by investors and our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties to other comparable properties, to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of our properties as NOI is not affected by (1) the cost of funds, (2) acquisition costs, (3) non-operating fees to affiliates, (4) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP, (5) corporate general and administrative expenses, (6) other gains and losses that are specific to us, and (7) entity level general and administrative expenses that are either non-recurring in nature or incurred on behalf of the Company at the property level for expenses such as legal, professional and franchise tax fees.\nThe Company began operations on March 31, 2015 as a result of the transfer and contribution by NexPoint Credit Strategies Fund ( NHF\u201d) of all but one of the multifamily properties owned by NHF through NHF's subsidiary Freedom REIT, LLC ( Freedom REIT\u201d) in exchange for 100% of its outstanding common stock. We use the term predecessor\u201d to mean the carve-out business of Freedom REIT, which owned all or a majority interest in the multifamily properties transferred or contributed to the Company by NHF through Freedom REIT. On March 31, 2015, NHF distributed all of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock held by NHF to holders of NHF common shares. We refer to the distribution of our common stock by NHF as the Spin-Off.\u201d Substantially all of our operations were conducted by our predecessor prior to March 31, 2015. With the exception of a nominal amount of initial cash funded at inception, the Company did not own any assets prior to March 31, 2015. Our predecessor included all of the properties in our portfolio that were held indirectly by Freedom REIT prior to the Spin-Off. Our predecessor was determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d). References throughout this report to the Company,\u201d we,\u201d or our,\u201d include the activity of the predecessor defined above.\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates for such new or revised standards. We may elect to comply with public company effective dates at any time, and such election would be irrevocable pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act. The following recent accounting pronouncements reflect effective dates that delay the adoption until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and our historical results of operations. The following should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those projected, forecasted or expected in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those which are discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d in this annual report. Our management believes the assumptions underlying the Company's Financial Statements and accompanying notes are reasonable. However, the Company's Financial Statements may not necessarily reflect our financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nWe intend to make regular quarterly dividend payments to holders of our common stock. U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100% of its taxable income. We intend to make regular quarterly dividend payments of all or substantially all of our taxable income to holders of our common stock out of assets legally available for this purpose, if and to the extent authorized by our Board. Before we make any dividend payments, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating requirements and debt service on our debt payable. If our cash available for distribution is less than our taxable income, we could be required to sell assets, borrow funds or raise additional capital to make cash dividends or we may make a portion of the required dividend in the form of a taxable distribution of stock or debt securities.\nExpenses\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe change in the Company's FFO and AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to FFO and AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily relates to the Company acquiring, owning and operating an additional 10 properties for a total of 42 properties as of December 31, 2015, as compared to acquiring, owning and operating 32 properties as of December 31, 2014. Also, 22 of the 32 properties owned as of December 31, 2014 were acquired during the second half of 2014 and therefore only contributed for less than half of the year in 2014 versus the entire year in 2015. Additionally, the increases in FFO and AFFO reflect increased Same Store revenues, net of increases in Same Store expenses. The change in the Company's FFO and AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to FFO and AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily relates to the Company acquiring, owning and operating an additional 31 properties for a total of 32 properties as of December 31, 2014, as compared to acquiring, owning and operating one property as of December 31, 2013.\nStockholders who participate in the distribution reinvestment program will recognize dividend income, taxable to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes), in the amount and as though they had received the cash rather than purchased shares through the distribution reinvestment program. These deemed dividends will be treated as actual dividends and will retain the character and tax effects applicable to all dividends. Shares received under the distribution reinvestment program will have a holding period, for tax purposes, beginning with the day after purchase, and a tax basis equal to their cost, which is the gross amount of the deemed distribution.\nReal estate taxes and insurance. Real estate taxes and insurance costs were $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was an increase of approximately $9.5 million. The increase for the period was primarily due to the acquisition of 10 additional properties. Also, 22 of the 32 properties owned as of December 31, 2014 were acquired during the second half of 2014 and therefore only contributed for less than half of the year in 2014 versus the entire year in 2015. Real estate taxes and insurance costs were $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was an increase of approximately $5.7 million. The increase for the period was primarily due to the acquisition of 31 additional properties. Further, the costs for property taxes incurred in the first year of ownership may be significantly less than subsequent years since the purchase price of the property may trigger a significant increase in assessed value by the taxing authority in subsequent years, increasing the costs of real estate taxes.\nThe accompanying combined consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The consolidated balance sheet includes the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Our predecessor combined consolidated financial statements were derived from the historical accounting records of our predecessor and reflect the historical financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods prior to the Spin-Off. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in combination and consolidation. The financial statements of the Company's subsidiaries are prepared using accounting polices consistent with those of the Company. In addition, the Company evaluates relationships with other entities to identify whether there are variable interest entities ( VIE's\u201d) as required by FASB ASC 810, Consolidation, and to assess whether it is the primary beneficiary of such entities. If the determination is made that the Company is the primary beneficiary, then that entity is included in the financial statements in accordance with FASB ASC 810. In the opinion of the Company's management, the accompanying combined consolidated financial statements include all adjustments and eliminations, consisting only of normal recurring items necessary for their fair presentation in conformity with GAAP. There have been no significant changes to the Company's significant accounting policies during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAcquisition costs. Acquisition costs were $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was a decrease of approximately $5.6 million. The decrease between the periods was due to the lower level of acquisitions completed during the period. Acquisition costs were $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was an increase of approximately $8.5 million. The increase between the periods was due to the higher level of acquisitions completed during the period. Acquisition costs depend on the specific circumstances of each closing and are one-time costs associated with each acquisition.\n (1) On August 4, 2015, the Department of Transportation of the State of Georgia ( DOT\u201d), through exercise of eminent domain, appropriated 0.966 acres of land and certain access rights from The Crossings in Marietta, GA and paid the sum of approximately $0.3 million as just and adequate compensation. The Company recognized a gain on eminent domain of approximately $0.2 million. Due to immateriality, the gain on eminent domain was included in other income for the year ended December 31, 2015. \nCapital Expenditures and Value-Add Program\nThe directors, including a majority of independent directors, by majority vote may amend or terminate the distribution reinvestment program upon 10 days' notice to participants.\nIncome Taxes\n \u00b7 Level 3 inputs are the unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity's own assumption, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on input from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. \nEach property has a separate non-recourse mortgage which is secured only by that property. These non-recourse mortgages have standard scope non-recourse carve outs required by agency lenders and generally call for protection by the borrower and the guarantor against losses by the lender for so-called bad acts,\u201d such as misrepresentations, and may include full recourse liability for more significant events such as bankruptcy. We and our property manager, BH, and its affiliates, provided non-recourse carve out guarantees for the mortgage indebtedness currently outstanding relating to the Portfolio.\nProperty general and administrative expenses. Property general and administrative costs were $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was an increase of approximately $3.3 million. The increase for the period was primarily due to the acquisition of 10 additional properties. Also, 22 of the 32 properties owned as of December 31, 2014 were acquired during the second half of 2014 and therefore only contributed for less than half of the year in 2014 versus the entire year in 2015. Property general and administrative costs were $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was an increase of approximately $2.1 million. The increase for the period was primarily due to the acquisition of 31 additional properties.\nWe could remain an emerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of becoming a public company, (2) the last day of the first fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1 billion or more, (3) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act (which would occur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million, measured as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and we have been publicly reporting for at least 12 months) or (4) the date on which we have, during the preceding three year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt.\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates\nWe will make dividend payments based on our estimate of taxable earnings per share of common stock, but not earnings calculated pursuant to GAAP. Our dividends and taxable income and GAAP earnings will typically differ due to items such as depreciation and amortization, fair value adjustments, differences in premium amortization and discount accretion, and non-deductible general and administrative expenses. Our quarterly dividends per share may be substantially different than our quarterly taxable earnings and GAAP earnings per share. The Board declared the Company's third quarterly dividend of $0.206 per share on November 10, 2015, which was paid on December 31, 2015 and funded out of operations.\nFair value measurements are determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy):\nREIT Tax Election\nWe believe that the use of FFO and AFFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO and AFFO to be useful measures for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, impairment charges and real estate depreciation and amortization, and, for AFFO, by excluding non-cash expenses such as acquisition expenses, equity-based compensation expenses and the amortization of deferred loan costs, FFO and AFFO can help investors compare our operating performance between periods and to other REITs. While FFO and AFFO are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of REITs, they do not represent cash flows from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO and AFFO do not purport to be indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to FFO and AFFO reported by other REITs that do not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition or define AFFO differently than we do.\nWe expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and existing cash balances. As of December 31, 2015, we have reserved approximately $24.5 million for our planned capital expenditures to implement our value-add program.\n\nCompany-specific Indebtedness\nProperty management fees. Property management fees were $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was an increase of approximately $2.2 million. The increase for the period was primarily due to the acquisition of 10 additional properties. Also, 22 of the 32 properties owned as of December 31, 2014 were acquired during the second half of 2014 and therefore only contributed for less than half of the year in 2014 versus the entire year in\nDividends\nProperty operating expenses. Property operating costs were $34.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was an increase of approximately $22.0 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to the acquisition of 10 additional properties. Also, 22 of the 32 properties owned as of December 31, 2014 were acquired during the second half of 2014 and therefore only contributed for less than half of the year in 2014 versus the entire year in 2015. Property operating costs were $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was an increase of approximately $12.2 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to the acquisition of 31 additional properties.\n \u00b7 administrative fees payable to our Adviser; \nFair Value Measurements\nImpairment\nProperty operating expenses. Property operating expenses include property maintenance costs, salary and employee benefit costs, utilities and other property operating costs.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAlthough we expect to be subject to restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, we expect that we will be able to refinance existing indebtedness or incur additional indebtedness for acquisitions or other purposes, if needed. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness, incur additional indebtedness or access additional sources of capital, such as by issuing common stock or other debt or equity securities, on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.\n \u00b7 Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. \nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, which changes the way reporting enterprises evaluate whether (a) they should consolidate limited partnerships and similar entities, (b) fees paid to a decision maker or service provider are variable interests in a VIE, and (c) variable interests in a VIE held by related parties of the reporting enterprise\n \u00b7 distributions necessary to qualify for taxation as a REIT; \nNOI is a measure of the operating performance of our properties but does not measure our performance as a whole. NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income (loss) as computed in accordance with GAAP. This measure should be analyzed in conjunction with net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP and discussions elsewhere in -Results of Operations\u201d regarding the components of net income (loss) that are eliminated in the calculation of NOI. Other companies may use different methods for calculating NOI or similarly entitled measures and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies that do not define the measure exactly as we do.\n\nComponents of Our Revenues and Expenses\nThe Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. The Company utilizes an independent third party to perform the allocation of value analysis for each property acquisition and also to perform the market valuations on the interest rate caps and has established policies, as described above, processes and procedures intended to ensure that the valuation methodologies for investments and interest rate caps are fair and consistent as of the measurement date.\n \u00b7 capital expenditures to complete our value-add program and to improve the quality and performance of our multifamily properties; \n\n\nThe changes in the Company's overall cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily relate to the Company acquiring, owning and operating an additional 10 properties for a total of 42 properties as of December 31, 2015 as compared to acquiring, owning and operating 32 properties as of December 31, 2014. Also, 22 of the 32 properties owned as of December 31, 2014 were acquired during the second half of 2014 and therefore only contributed for less than half of the year in 2014 versus the entire year in 2015. The changes in the Company's overall cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily relate to the Company acquiring, owning and operating an additional 31 properties for a total of 32 properties as of December 31, 2014 as compared to acquiring, owning and operating one property as of December 31, 2013.\nOur long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the costs of acquiring additional multifamily properties, renovations and other capital expenditures to improve our multifamily properties and scheduled debt payments and distributions. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, which may include a revolving credit facility and future debt or equity issuances, existing working capital, net cash provided by operations, long-term mortgage indebtedness and other secured and unsecured borrowings. However, there are a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to access these capital sources, including the state of overall equity and credit markets, our degree of leverage, our unencumbered asset base and borrowing restrictions imposed by lenders (including as a result of any failure to comply with financial covenants in our existing and future indebtedness), general market conditions for REITs, our operating performance and liquidity and market perceptions about us. The success of our business strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to access these various capital sources.\nInterest expense. Interest expense costs were $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was an increase of approximately $11.2 million. The increase for the period was primarily due to the acquisition of 10 additional properties. Also, 22 of the 32 properties owned as of December 31, 2014 were acquired during the second half of 2014 and therefore only contributed for less than half of the year in 2014 versus the entire year in 2015. There were no interest expense costs for the year ended December 31, 2013. The following is a table that details the various costs included in interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 (in thousands):\nAcquisition costs. Acquisition costs include the costs to acquire additional properties.\nInterest expense. Interest expense primarily includes the cost of interest expense on debt, the amortization of deferred financing costs, and the fair value adjustments on interest rate caps that are not designated as hedges.\n \u00b7 interest expense and scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness (see -Obligations and Commitments\u201d); \nThe change in the Company's operating results for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the operating results for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily relates to the Company acquiring, owning and operating an additional 10 properties for a total of 42 properties as of December 31, 2015 as compared to acquiring, owning and operating 32 properties as of December 31, 2014, as well as increases in same store operating results. The change in the Company's operating results for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the operating results for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily relates to the Company acquiring, owning and operating an additional 31 properties for a total of 32 properties as of December 31, 2014 as compared to acquiring, owning and operating one property as of December 31, 2013.\nThe following table, which has not been adjusted for the effects of any noncontrolling interests, details our net operating income for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 (in thousands):\nThe following critical accounting policies and estimates apply to the Company.\n\nCorporate general and administrative expenses. Corporate general and administrative expenses include but are not limited to payments of reimbursements to the Adviser, audit fees, legal fees, listing fees, board of director fees, and investor relation costs. The reimbursement of Adviser Operating Expenses, administrative fees and the advisory fees paid to our Adviser (including advisory and administrative fees on New Assets) will not exceed 1.5% of Average Real Estate Assets per calendar year (or part thereof that the Advisory Agreement is in effect), or the Expense Cap\u201d. The Expense Cap does not limit the reimbursement by the Company of expenses related to securities offerings paid by the Adviser. The Expense Cap also does not apply to legal, accounting, financial, due diligence and other service fees incurred in connection with mergers and acquisitions, extraordinary litigation or other events outside the Company's ordinary course of business or any out-of-pocket acquisition or due diligence expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition or disposition of real estate assets.\nWe are primarily focused on directly or indirectly acquiring, owning, and operating well-located multifamily properties with a value-add component in large cities and suburban submarkets of large cities, primarily in the Southeastern and Southwestern United States. We generate revenue primarily by leasing our multifamily properties. We intend to employ management and capex value-add programs at a majority of our properties in an attempt to improve rental rates and the net operating income at our properties. We are externally managed by NexPoint Real Estate Advisors L.P., or our Adviser, an affiliate of Highland Capital Management, L.P. (our Sponsor\u201d or Highland\u201d), a leading global alternative asset manager and an SEC-registered investment adviser which, together with its affiliates, had approximately $18.3 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2015.\nAt the time of the Spin-Off, which occurred on March 31, 2015, the Company owned all or a majority interest in a portfolio of 38 multifamily properties. Following the Spin-Off, the Company acquired one property in April 2015, two properties in August 2015, and one property in October 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the Company owned all or a majority interest in a portfolio of multifamily properties, or the Portfolio, primarily located in the Southeastern and Southwestern United States, consisting of 42 multifamily properties encompassing 13,155 units of apartment space that was approximately 93.9% leased. The weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit in our Portfolio is $803 as of December 31, 2015.\nWe intend to elect to be taxed and qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our 2015 tax year. To maintain REIT status, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains.\nShares for the distribution reinvestment program are acquired from the exchange or market on which our shares are listed at the prevailing market price. If we use the services of a broker to acquire shares of our common stock in connection with the distribution reinvestment program, we will allocate the costs of such broker among all of the participants in the program. We will not charge these investors for any fees other than the actual third-party out-of-pocket expenses that we incur. Neither we, nor our Adviser, nor our affiliates receives a fee for managing the distribution reinvestment program. We do not warrant or guarantee that participants will acquire shares at the lowest possible price through the program.\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates for such new or revised standards. We may elect to comply with public company effective dates at any time, and such election would be irrevocable pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act.\nThe cost of funds is eliminated from net income (loss) because it is specific to our particular financing capabilities and constraints. The cost of funds is also eliminated because it is dependent on historical interest rates and other costs of capital as well as past decisions made by us regarding the appropriate mix of capital which may have changed or may change in the future. Acquisition costs and non-operating fees to affiliates are eliminated because they do not reflect continuing operating costs of the property owner. Depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets are eliminated because they may not accurately represent the actual change in value in our multifamily properties that result from use of the properties or changes in market conditions. While certain aspects of real property do decline in value over time in a manner that is reasonably captured by depreciation and amortization, the value of the properties as a whole have historically increased or decreased as a result of changes in overall economic conditions instead of from actual use of the property or the passage of time. Gains and losses from the sale of real property vary from property to property and are affected by market conditions at the time of sale which will usually change from period to period. Entity level general and administrative are eliminated as they are specific to the way in which we have chosen to hold our properties and are the result of our joint venture ownership structuring. Also, non-recurring expenses that are incurred upon acquisition of a property do not reflect continuing operating costs of the property owner. These gains and losses can create distortions when comparing one period to another or when comparing our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies that have not made similarly timed purchases or sales. We believe that eliminating these costs from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual ongoing revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating our properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.\n (1) Includes total capital expenditures during the period on completed and in-progress interior rehabs. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we completed full and partial interior rehabs on 2,313 and 330 units, respectively. \n2015. Property management fees were $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was an increase of approximately $1.3 million. The increase for the period was primarily due to the acquisition of 31 additional properties.\n\nFurthermore, following the completion of our value-add and capital expenditures programs and depending on the interest rate environment at the applicable time, we may seek to refinance our floating rate debt into longer-term fixed rate debt at lower leverage levels.\nOther income. Other income includes ancillary income earned from tenants such as application fees, late fees, laundry fees, utility reimbursements, and other rental related fees charged to tenants.\nWe entered into and expect to continue to enter into interest rate cap agreements with various third parties to cap the variable interest rates on a majority of our outstanding mortgage indebtedness. These agreements generally have a term of three to four years and cover the outstanding principal amount of the underlying indebtedness. Under these agreements, we pay a fixed fee in exchange for the counterparty to pay any interest above a maximum rate. At December 31, 2015, interest rate cap agreements covered $577.9 million of the $636.8 million of total outstanding floating rate mortgage indebtedness relating to the Company. These interest rate cap agreements cap the related variable interest rates of our mortgage indebtedness at a weighted average interest rate of 5.99% as of December 31, 2015. Three mortgages totaling $58.9 million did not have caps associated with them as of December 31, 2015.\nAdvisory and administrative fees. Advisory and administrative fees were $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was an increase of approximately $3.9 million. The increase for the period was due to the acquisition of 10 additional properties, seven of which are defined as Contributed Assets and three of which are defined as New Assets pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, which increases the basis on which the fee is earned. Following the Spin-Off, the amount paid in 2015 represents the maximum fee allowed on Contributed Assets under the Advisory Agreement plus approximately $0.2 million of advisory and administrative fees incurred on Madera Point, The Pointe at the Foothills, and The Place at Vanderbilt, defined as New Assets pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, for the three months ended December 31, 2015. Advisory and administrative fees were $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was an increase of approximately $1.7 million. The increase for the period was due to the acquisition of 31 additional properties. Advisory and administrative fees may increase in future periods as the Company acquires additional properties.\n \u00b7 property management fees payable to BH. \nOn October 21, 2015, the Company refinanced the $13.1 million existing fixed rate HUD loan on Regatta Bay with a $14.0 million, full-term interest only, floating rate loan that has an interest rate equal to three-month LIBOR (subject to a floor of 0.25%) plus 1.70%. The Company incurred a 5.0% pre-payment penalty of approximately $0.7 million on the refinancing, received approximately $0.3 million in net proceeds from the new loan, and will realize annual savings of approximately $0.4 million based on three-month LIBOR as of December 31, 2015. The new loan matures on November 1, 2020 and can be pre-paid in the first 12 months of the term at par plus 1.00% and at par thereafter.\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our combined consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate these judgments, assumptions and estimates for\nRevenues\nNOI for the Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013\nThe Company intends to elect to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) for the 2015 tax year. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax at the corporate level. We are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code, and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a REIT.\nReal Estate Investments\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide disclosures when it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption being permitted. The Company will implement the provisions of ASU 2014-15 as of January 1, 2016. The Company does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on its combined consolidated financial statements.\nDistribution Reinvestment Program\nCash flows from financing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $251.1 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $647.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities for the period was mainly due to the level of activity related to the debt funded on the respective property closings and capital contributed at each closing. During the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was $647.3 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.
