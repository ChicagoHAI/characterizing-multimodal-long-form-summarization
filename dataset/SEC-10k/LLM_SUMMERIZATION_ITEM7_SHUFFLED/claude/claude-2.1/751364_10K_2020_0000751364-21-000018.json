Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this annual report on Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 filed with the Commission on February 11, 2020.\nThe term \"NNN\" or the \"Company\" refers to National Retail Properties, Inc. and all of its consolidated subsidiaries. NNN may elect to treat certain subsidiaries as taxable real estate investment trust subsidiaries, (\"TRS\").\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. NNN makes statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in this report entitled Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Certain risks may cause NNN's actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion. For a discussion of such risk factors, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nNNN, a Maryland corporation, is a fully integrated real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") formed in 1984. NNN's assets are primarily real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and are primarily held for investment (\"Properties,\" or \"Property Portfolio,\" or individually a \"Property\").\nNNN owned 3,143 Properties with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 32,461,000 square feet, located in 48 states, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.7 years as of December 31, 2020. Approximately 99 percent of the Properties were leased as of December 31, 2020.\nNNN's management team focuses on certain key indicators to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. The key indicators for NNN include items such as: the composition of the Property Portfolio (such as tenant, geographic and line of trade diversification), the occupancy rate of the Property Portfolio, certain financial performance ratios and profitability measures, industry trends and industry performance compared to that of NNN.\nNNN evaluates the creditworthiness of its current and prospective tenants. This evaluation may include reviewing available financial statements, store level financial performance, press releases, public credit ratings from major credit rating agencies, industry news publications and financial market data (debt and equity pricing). NNN may also evaluate the business and operations of its tenants, including past payment history and periodically meeting with senior management of certain tenants.\nNNN continues to maintain its diversification by tenant, geography and tenant's line of trade. NNN's largest lines of trade concentrations are the convenience store and restaurant (including full and limited service) sectors. These sectors represent a large part of the freestanding retail property marketplace and NNN's management believes these sectors present attractive investment opportunities. The Property Portfolio is geographically concentrated in the south and southeast United States, which are regions of historically above-average population growth. Given these concentrations, any financial hardship within these sectors or geographic regions could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operating performance of NNN.\nAs of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Property Portfolio remained at least 98 percent leased and had a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 11 years. High occupancy levels coupled with a net lease structure, provides enhanced probability of maintaining operating earnings.\nImpact of COVID-19 on NNN's Business\nOverview. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a novel strain of coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. Since that time, efforts taken in an attempt to contain the spread of COVID-19 have intensified. Several countries, including the United States, have taken steps to restrict travel, temporarily close businesses and issue quarantine orders, and it remains unclear how long such measures will remain in place.\nAs a result, the COVID-19 pandemic and the government reaction to it is negatively affecting almost every industry directly or indirectly. A number of NNN's tenants have announced temporary closures of their operations and/or have requested adjustments to their lease terms during this pandemic. The actions taken by the government to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 by, at certain times, ordering closure of, or reducing capacity at, many businesses and ordering residents to generally stay at home has resulted in the loss of revenue for many of NNN's tenants and challenged their ability to pay rent. As a result, these economic hardships have increased uncertainty with respect to the collectability of lease payments and have had a negative effect on NNN's financial results, including increased accounts receivables and related allowances and recognizing revenue on a cash basis from certain of its tenants.\nAs of January 31, 2021, NNN had collected approximately 96% of rent originally due in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 and approximately 95% of rent originally due in January 2021.\nThe following table details the rental revenue collected as of January 31, 2021, excluding the repayment of amounts previously deferred according to the rent deferral lease amendments for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 as a percentage of annualized base rent:\nTable 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Top 20 Lines of Trade </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total Annual Base Rent(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Rent Collected </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1. </td> <td>Convenience stores </td> <td> </td> <td>18.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2. </td> <td>Restaurants - full service </td> <td> </td> <td>10.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3. </td> <td>Automotive service </td> <td> </td> <td>10.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4. </td> <td>Restaurants - limited service </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5. </td> <td>Family entertainment centers </td> <td> </td> <td>5.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6. </td> <td>Health and fitness </td> <td> </td> <td>5.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7. </td> <td>Theaters </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>8. </td> <td>Recreational vehicle dealers, parts and accessories </td> <td> </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>9. </td> <td>Automotive parts </td> <td> </td> <td>3.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>10. </td> <td>Equipment rental </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>11. </td> <td>Home improvement </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>12. </td> <td>Wholesale clubs </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>13. </td> <td>Medical service providers </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>14. </td> <td>General merchandise </td> <td> </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>15. </td> <td>Furniture </td> <td> </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>16. </td> <td>Home furnishings </td> <td> </td> <td>1.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>17. </td> <td>Consumer electronics </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>18. </td> <td>Travel plazas </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>19. </td> <td>Drug stores </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>20. </td> <td>Bank </td> <td> </td> <td>1.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>8.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Based on annualized base rent for all leases in place as of December 31, 2020.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRent collections may continue below amounts required under the leases. Rent collections for the year ended December 31, 2020 may not be indicative of rent collections in the future.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, NNN entered into rent deferral lease amendments with certain tenants for an aggregate $50,719,000 and $1,410,000 of rent originally due for the year ending December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. The rent deferral lease amendments required the deferred rents to be repaid at a later time during the lease term. Approximately $3,259,000 of the deferred rent was repaid in 2020. Deferred rents of $36,794,000, $10,944,000 and $1,132,000 are due to be repaid during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. Depending upon the duration of impact on tenants and the overall economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, future rent payments including deferred rents may be difficult to collect. Additionally, rent collections and rent relief requests for the year ended December 31, 2020 may not be indicative of rent collections and requests in the future.\nA prolonged continuation of business closures, reduced capacity at businesses or other social-distancing practices may adversely impact NNN's tenants' ability to generate sufficient revenues to meet financial obligations, and could force tenants to default on their leases, or result in the bankruptcy of tenants, which would diminish the rental revenue NNN receives under its leases. Additionally, an increase in the number of vacant properties would increase NNN's real estate expenses, including expenses associated with ongoing maintenance and repairs, utilities, property taxes and property and liability insurance.\nNNN moderated new property investments during 2020 in order to better gauge the impact of the economic downturn on retailers, retail real estate, capital markets and investment returns. NNN will continue to monitor the impact of the economic downturn, among other things, when considering new property investments in 2021. As of December 31, 2020, NNN had $267,236,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $900,000,000 available for borrowings under its unsecured revolving credit facility (the \"Credit Facility\"). While the impacts of COVID-19 are still unfolding, NNN currently expects these combined resources, in addition to the cash provided by NNN's operations to be sufficient to meet NNN's demand for funds.\nBusiness Continuity. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, NNN has transitioned a large portion of its associates to work remotely without any adverse impact on its ability to continue to operate its business nor has this transition had any material adverse impact on NNN's financial reporting systems, internal controls over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures.\nThe rapid development and fluidity of the economic downturn precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact on the economy, retailing and NNN and will ultimately depend on future developments, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. Nevertheless, the economic downturn presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to NNN's performance, business or financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Item \"1A. Risk Factors.\"\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of NNN's consolidated financial statements in conformance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as other disclosures in the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions, which in turn could have a material impact on NNN's financial statements. A summary of NNN's accounting policies and procedures are included in Note 1 of NNN's consolidated financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of NNN's consolidated financial statements.\nReal Estate Portfolio. NNN records the acquisition of real estate at cost, including acquisition and closing costs. The cost of properties developed or funded by NNN includes direct and indirect costs of construction, property taxes, interest and other miscellaneous costs incurred during the development period until the project is substantially complete and available for occupancy.\nPurchase Accounting for Acquisition of Real Estate. In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") guidance on business combinations, consideration for the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and tenant improvements and, if applicable, to identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases and value of in-place leases, as applicable, based on their respective fair values.\nThe fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions, such as establishing a range of relevant market assumptions for land, building and rent and where the acquired property falls within that range. These market assumptions for land, building\nand rent use the most relevant comparable properties for an acquisition. The final range relies upon ranking comparable properties' attributes from most similar to least similar.\nLease Accounting. In accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842),\" (\"ASC 842\"), NNN recorded right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and operating lease liabilities of approximately $7,735,000 and $10,155,000 respectively, as of January 1, 2019.\nIn April 2020, the FASB issued interpretive guidance relating to the accounting for lease concessions provided as a result of COVID-19. In this guidance, entities can elect not to apply lease modification accounting with respect to such lease concessions and instead, treat the concession as if it was a part of the existing contract. This guidance is only applicable to COVID-19 related lease concessions that do not result in a substantial increase in the rights of the lessor or the obligations of the lessee. NNN elected to make this policy election for COVID-19 lease concessions, including the rent deferral lease amendments effective during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nIn accordance with ASC 842, NNN reviews the collectability of its lease payments on an ongoing basis. NNN considers collectability indicators when analyzing accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends, all of which assists in evaluating the probability of outstanding and future lease payment collections. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and considerations are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition bankruptcy claims. At the point NNN deems the collection of lease payments not probable, previously recognized rental revenue is reversed and any related accrued rent and, subsequently, any lease revenue is only recognized when cash receipts are received. As a result of the review of lease payments collectability, NNN recorded a write-off of $21,792,000 of outstanding receivables and related accrued rent during the year ended December 31, 2020, and reclassified certain tenants as cash basis for accounting purposes.\nNNN includes an allowance for doubtful accounts in rental income on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately six percent of total Properties, and approximately eight percent aggregate gross leasable area held in the Property Portfolio, were leased to 13 tenants that NNN has determined to recognize revenue on a cash basis. During the year ended December 31, 2020, NNN recognized $4,722,000 of rental income from certain tenants for periods following their classification to cash basis for accounting. NNN did not recognize any such revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nReal Estate - Held For Sale. Real estate held for sale is not depreciated and is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, less costs to sell.\nImpairment - Real Estate. Based upon certain events or changes in circumstances, management periodically assesses its Properties for possible impairment whenever the carrying value of the asset, including accrued rental income, may not be recoverable through operations. Events or circumstances that may occur include changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, and the ability to sell properties at a price that exceeds NNN's carrying value. Management evaluates whether an impairment in carrying value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying value of the individual asset. The future undiscounted cash flows are primarily driven by estimated future market rents. Future cash flow estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made by management regarding future market rents, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN's Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, which provide for cash flows over this term. NNN intends to hold these assets for the long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to COVID-19 alone would not be an indicator of impairment.\nRevenue Recognition. Rental revenues for properties under construction commence upon completion of construction of the leased asset and delivery of the leased asset to the tenant. Rental revenues for non-development real estate assets are recognized when earned in accordance with the FASB guidance included in Leases, based on the terms of the lease of the leased asset. Lease termination fees are recognized when collected subsequent to the related lease that is cancelled and NNN no longer has continuing involvement with the former tenant with respect to that property.\nThe core principle of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\", is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Certain contracts are\nexcluded from ASU 2014-09, including lease contracts within the scope of the FASB guidance included in Leases (Topic 842). NNN determined the key revenue stream impacted by ASU 2014-09 is gain on disposition of real estate reported on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. In accordance with ASU 2014-09, NNN evaluates any separate contracts or performance obligations to determine proper timing and/or amount of revenue recognition, as well as, transaction price allocation.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements. Refer to Note 1 of the December 31, 2020, Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary and the anticipated impact of each accounting pronouncement on NNN's financial position or results of operations.\nResults of Operations\nProperty Analysis\nGeneral.

NNN's total revenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period ended in 2019. The decrease is primarily due to the write-off of receivables and lower rent collection from certain tenants due to the pandemic impact. NNN's total revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period ended in 2018. The increase is primarily due to the increase in rental income from Property acquisitions (See \"Results of Operations - Property Analysis - Property Acquisitions\").\nThe following summarizes NNN's revenues for each of the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020\nVersus\nPercent </td> <td> </td> <td>2019\nVersus\nPercent </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental Revenues(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>640,754 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>652,220 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>604,615 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate expense reimbursement from tenants\n</td> <td> </td> <td>18,039 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,789 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,784 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>658,793 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>669,009 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>621,399 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.5) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other income from real estate transactions\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,888 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,478 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,262 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>17.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>660,681 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>670,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>622,661 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.5) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes rental income from operating leases, earned income from direct financing leases and percentage rent (\"Rental Revenues\").\nComparison of Revenues - 2020 versus 2019\nRental Income. Rental income decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease is primarily due to the write-off of $21,793,000 of receivables due to reclassifying certain tenants as cash basis for accounting purposes and the lower probability of collecting rent from certain tenants due to the pandemic impact. The decrease in rental income for the year ended December 31, 2020 is partially offset by an increase in Rental Revenue due to Property acquisitions:\n(i)a partial year of Rental Revenue from 63 Properties with aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 449,000 square feet acquired in 2020, and\n(ii)a full year of Rental Revenue from 210 Properties with a gross leasable area of approximately 3,164,000 square feet acquired in 2019.\nComparison of Revenues - 2019 versus 2018\nRefer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 filed with the Commission on February 11, 2020, for a detailed comparison of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 versus December 31, 2018.\nAnalysis of Expenses\nGeneral. Operating expenses increased primarily due to the increase in depreciation and amortization expense and impairment losses recognized on real estate during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019.

General and administrative expenses increased modestly in amount and as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, is primarily attributable to an increase in compensation costs, offset by a decrease in other general costs associated with operating NNN's business.\nReal Estate. Real estate expenses increased in amount and as a percentage of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. NNN focuses on real estate expenses, net of reimbursements from tenants. NNN's net real estate expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $10,323,000 and $10,867,000,\nrespectively. The decrease in real estate expenses, net of reimbursements from tenants, is primarily attributable to vacant properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2020, offset by the write-off of reimbursements from certain tenants.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased in amount for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The increase in depreciation and amortization expenses is primarily due to a partial year of depreciation from 63 Properties with aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 449,000 square feet acquired in 2020, and a full year of depreciation from 210 Properties with a gross leasable area of approximately 3,164,000 square feet acquired in 2019.\nImpairment Losses - Real Estate, Net of Recoveries. NNN reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that may occur include changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, and the ability to sell properties at a price that exceeds NNN's carrying value. Management evaluates whether an impairment in value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying cost of the individual asset. The future undiscounted cash flows are primarily driven by estimated future market rents. Future cash flow estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made by management regarding future market rents, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. Generally, NNN's Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, which provide for cash flows over this term. NNN intends to hold these assets for the long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to COVID-19 alone would not be an indicator of impairment. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, NNN recorded $37,442,000 and $31,992,000, respectively, of real estate impairments, net of recoveries.\nRetirement Severance Costs. For the year ended December 31, 2020, retirement severance costs relate primarily to the retirement of NNN's former Chief Investment Officer on December 31, 2020.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. The increase is attributable to an increase in outstanding debt, including the following activity related to NNN's notes payable (dollars in thousands):\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction </td> <td> </td> <td>Effective Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Principal </td> <td> </td> <td>Stated Interest Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Original Maturity </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issuance 2030 Notes </td> <td> </td> <td>March 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>400,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.500 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>April 2030 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issuance 2050 Notes </td> <td> </td> <td>March 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>300,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>April 2050 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Redemption 2022 Notes </td> <td> </td> <td>March 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>(325,000) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.800 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>October 2022 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was partially offset by a decrease of $5,163,000 in the weighted average outstanding balance, and a 20 basis points decrease in the interest rate, on the Credit Facility for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The Credit Facility had a weighted average outstanding balance of $18,895,000 and $24,058,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, includes $2,291,000 in connection with the early redemption of the 2022 Notes described below.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. In March 2020, NNN redeemed the $325,000,000 3.800% notes payable that were due in October 2022. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount of $16,679,000, and (ii) all accrued and unpaid interest.\nComparison of Expenses - 2019 versus 2018\nRefer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 filed with the Commission on February 11, 2020, for a detailed comparison of expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 versus December 31, 2018.\nImpact of Inflation\nNNN's leases typically contain provisions to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on NNN's results of operations. Tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of fixed increases, increases in the CPI, and/or, to a lesser extent, increases in the tenant's sales volume. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, rent increases will not keep up with the rate of inflation.\nProperties are leased to tenants under long-term, net leases which typically require the tenant to pay certain operating expenses for a Property, thus, NNN's exposure to inflation is reduced with respect to these expenses. Inflation may have an adverse impact on NNN's tenants.\nLiquidity\nGeneral. NNN's demand for funds has been and will continue to be primarily for (i) payment of operating expenses and cash dividends; (ii) Property acquisitions and development; (iii) capital expenditures; (iv) payment of principal and interest on its outstanding debt; and (v) other investments.\nWhile the total impact of the economic downturn are unknown, NNN expects to meet short-term liquidity requirements through cash and cash equivalents, cash provided from operations and NNN's Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020, NNN had $267,236,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $900,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility. NNN moderated new property investments during 2020 in order to better gauge the impact of the economic downturn on retailers, retail real estate, capital markets and investment returns. NNN will continue to monitor the impact of the economic downturn, among other things, when considering new property investments in 2021. (See \"Overview - Impact of COVID-19 on NNN's Business\").\nNNN anticipates its long-term capital needs will be funded by the Credit Facility, cash provided from operations, the issuance of long-term debt or the issuance of common or preferred equity or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable for common or preferred equity. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing or capital will be available, or that the terms will be acceptable or advantageous to NNN.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. NNN's cash and cash equivalents includes the aggregate of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash held in escrow from the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NNN did not have restricted cash, including cash held in escrow as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The table below summarizes NNN's cash flows for each of the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>450,194 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>501,727 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>471,909 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Used in investing activities </td> <td>(142,816) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(619,408) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(609,371) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provided by (used in) financing activities </td> <td>(41,254) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,526 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>250,365 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) </td> <td>266,124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(113,155) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>112,903 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash at beginning of year </td> <td>1,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114,267 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,364 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash at end of year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>267,236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>114,267 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash provided by operating activities represents cash received primarily from Rental Revenues and interest income less cash used for general and administrative expenses. NNN's cash flow from operating activities has been sufficient to pay the distributions for each period presented. The change in cash provided by operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, is primarily the result of changes in revenues and expenses as discussed in Results of Operations.\u201d Cash generated from operations is expected to fluctuate in the future.\nChanges in cash for investing activities are primarily attributable to acquisitions and dispositions of Properties. NNN typically uses cash on hand or proceeds from its Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of its Properties.\nNNN's financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, included the following significant transactions:\n(i) Issuance and redemption of notes payable resulted in the following:\n\u2022$395,062,000 in net proceeds from the issuance in March of the 2.500% notes payable due in April 2030,\n\u2022$290,459,000 in net proceeds from the issuance in March of the 3.100% notes payable due in April 2050,\n\u2022$325,000,000 payment in March for the early redemption of the 3.800% notes payable due in October 2022, and\n\u2022$16,679,000 payment in March of the make-whole amount for the early redemption of the 3.800% notes payable due in October 2022.\n(ii) Issuance of common stock resulted in the following net proceeds:\n\u2022$119,185,000 from the issuance of 3,119,153 shares of common stock in connection with the at-the-market (\"ATM\") equity program; and\n\u2022$5,092,000 from the issuance of 138,507 shares of common stock in connection with the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan ( DRIP\u201d).\n(iii) Dividends paid:\n\u2022$356,409,000 to common stockholders; and\n\u2022$17,940,000 to holders of the depositary shares of NNN's 5.200% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the \"Series F Preferred Stock\").\nFinancing Strategy. NNN's financing objective is to manage its capital structure effectively in order to provide sufficient capital to execute its operating strategy while servicing its debt requirements, maintaining its investment grade credit rating, staggering debt maturities and providing value to NNN's stockholders. NNN generally utilizes debt and equity security offerings, bank borrowings, proceeds from the disposition of certain properties, and to a lesser extent, internally generated funds to meet its capital needs.\nNNN typically funds its short-term liquidity requirements, including investments in additional Properties, with cash from its Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020, there was no outstanding balance and $900,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2020, NNN's ratio of total debt to total gross assets (before accumulated depreciation and amortization) was approximately 34 percent and the ratio of secured debt to total gross assets was less than one percent. The ratio of total debt to total market capitalization was approximately 29 percent. Certain financial agreements to which NNN is a party contain covenants that limit NNN's ability to incur additional debt under certain circumstances. The organizational documents of NNN do not limit the absolute amount or percentage of debt that NNN may incur. Additionally, NNN may change its financing strategy.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. The information in the following table summarizes NNN's contractual obligations and commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2020. The table presents principal cash flows by year-end of the expected maturity for debt obligations and commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2020.\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Expected Maturity Date (dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt(1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,261,241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>630 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>664 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>359,947 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>350,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>400,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,150,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt - interest(2)\n</td> <td>1,222,808 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119,281 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119,247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>110,820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>682,204 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Headquarters office lease(3)\n</td> <td>3,460 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>788 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>804 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>821 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>837 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>210 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ground leases(4)\n</td> <td>7,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>573 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>582 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>582 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>601 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>639 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,905 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,495,391 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121,272 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121,297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>472,170 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>451,194 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>492,349 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,837,109 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes only principal amounts outstanding under mortgages payable and notes payable and excludes unamortized mortgage\npremiums, note discounts and note costs. See \"Debt - Mortgages Payable\" and \"Debt - Notes Payable\".\n(2)Interest calculation on mortgage and notes payable based on stated rate of the principal amount. See \"Debt - Mortgages Payable\" and \"Debt - Notes Payable\".\n(3)NNN is a lessee for its headquarters office lease.\n(4)NNN is a lessee for three ground lease arrangements.\nIn addition to the contractual obligations outlined above, NNN has committed to fund construction on five Properties. The improvements on such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months. These construction commitments, at December 31, 2020, are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands):\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commitment(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,443 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less amount funded </td> <td> </td> <td>35,094 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remaining commitment </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,349 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs and capitalized interest\nAs of December 31, 2020, NNN did not have any other material contractual cash obligations, such as purchase obligations, financing lease obligations or other long-term liabilities other than those reflected in the table. In addition to items reflected in the table, NNN has issued preferred stock with cumulative preferential cash distributions, as described below under Dividends.\u201d\nManagement anticipates satisfying these obligations with a combination of NNN's cash provided from operations, current capital resources on hand, its Credit Facility, debt or equity financings and asset dispositions.\nGenerally, the Properties are leased under long-term triple net leases, which require the tenant to pay all property taxes and assessments, to maintain the interior and exterior of the Property, and to carry property and liability insurance coverage. Therefore, management anticipates that capital demands to meet obligations with respect to these Properties will be modest for the foreseeable future and can be met with funds from operations and working capital. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses associated with the Property. Management anticipates the costs associated with these Properties, NNN's vacant Properties or those Properties that become vacant will also be met with funds from operations and working capital. NNN may be required to borrow under its Credit Facility or use other sources of capital in the event of significant capital expenditures or major repairs.\nThe lost revenues and increased property expenses resulting from vacant Properties or uncollectability of lease revenues could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and results of operations if NNN is unable to re-lease the Properties at comparable rental rates and in a timely manner. NNN currently expects a short-term decrease in cash from operations as its tenants are impacted by the pandemic and, while contractually obligated, some have not paid all rent amounts due (See \"Overview - Impact of COVID-19 on NNN's Business\").\nAs of December 31, 2020, NNN owned 47 vacant, un-leased Properties which accounted for approximately one percent of total Properties held in the Property Portfolio.\nAdditionally, as of February 10, 2021, less than two percent of total Properties, and approximately one percent of aggregate gross leasable area held in the Property Portfolio, was leased to two tenants that are currently in bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. As a result, these tenants have the right to reject or affirm their leases with NNN.\nNNN generally monitors the financial performance of its significant tenants on an ongoing basis.\nA prolonged continuation of business closures, reduced capacity at businesses or other social-distancing practices as a result of COVID-19 may adversely impact NNN's tenants' ability to generate sufficient revenues to meet financial obligations, and could force tenants to default on their leases, or result in the bankruptcy of tenants, which would diminish the rental revenue NNN receives under its leases. The rapid development and fluidity of the pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact on NNN (See \"Overview - Impact of COVID-19 on NNN's Business\").\nDividends. NNN has made an election to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), and related regulations and intends to continue to operate so as to remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. NNN generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that it distributes to its stockholders, provided that it distributes 100 percent of its REIT taxable income and meets certain other requirements for qualifying as a REIT. If NNN fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four years following the year during which qualification is lost. Such an event could materially adversely affect NNN's income and ability to pay dividends. NNN believes it has been structured as, and its past and present operations qualify NNN as, a REIT.\nOne of NNN's primary objectives is to distribute a substantial portion of its funds available from operations to its stockholders in the form of dividends, while retaining sufficient cash for reserves and working capital purposes and maintaining its status as a REIT.\nThe following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for NNN's common stock for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands, except per share data):\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividends </td> <td>$ </td> <td>356,409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>333,692 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>303,164 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Per share </td> <td>2.070 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.030 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.950 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following presents the characterizations for tax purposes of such common stock dividends for the years ended December 31:\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ordinary dividends(1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.659755 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80.1814 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.762899 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86.8423 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.658604 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85.0566 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital gain </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.015534 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7966 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.042818 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1958 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nontaxable distributions </td> <td>0.410245 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.8186 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.267101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.1577 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.233044 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.9510 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.070000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0000 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.030000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0000 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.950000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0000 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Eligible for the 20% qualified business income deduction under section 199A of the Code that was amended by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017, (\"TCJA\").\nOn January 15, 2021, NNN declared a dividend of $0.520 per share, payable February 16, 2021, to its common stockholders of record as of January 29, 2021.\nHolders of NNN's preferred stock issuances are entitled to receive, when and as authorized by the Board of Directors, cumulative preferential cash distributions based on the stated rate and liquidation preference per annum.

Cash needs for operating and interest expenses and dividends have generally been funded by internally generated funds. If available, future sources of capital include proceeds from the public or private offering of NNN's debt or equity securities, secured or unsecured borrowings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from the sale of Properties, as well as undistributed funds from operations.\nDebt\nNNN expects to use debt primarily for property acquisitions and development of single-tenant retail properties, either directly or through investment interests. Additionally, debt may be used to refinance existing debt.\nThe following is a summary of NNN's total outstanding debt as of December 31 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage\nof Total </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage\nof Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Line of credit payable </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>133,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgages payable </td> <td>11,395 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12,059 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes payable </td> <td>3,209,527 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2,842,698 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total outstanding debt </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,220,922 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,988,357 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLine of Credit Payable. NNN's $900,000,000 Credit Facility had a weighted average outstanding balance of $18,895,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 2.6% during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Credit Facility matures January 2022, unless the Company exercises its option to extend maturity to January 2023. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature for NNN to increase the facility size up to $1,600,000,000, subject to lender approval. In May 2020, NNN amended its Credit Facility to include the addition of new terms and definitions, and to restate certain other definitions under the former unsecured revolving credit agreement, some of which modified the financial covenant calculations. As of December 31, 2020, there was no outstanding balance and $900,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility.\nIn accordance with the terms of the Credit Facility, NNN is required to meet certain restrictive financial covenants, which, among other things, require NNN to maintain certain (i) leverage ratios, (ii) debt service coverage, (iii) cash flow coverage, and (iv) investment limitations. At December 31, 2020, NNN was in compliance with those covenants. In the event that NNN violates any of these restrictive financial covenants, it could cause the debt under the Credit Facility to be accelerated and may impair NNN's access to the debt and equity markets and limit NNN's ability to pay dividends to its common and preferred stockholders, each of which would likely have a material adverse impact on NNN's financial condition and results of operations.\nMortgages Payable. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, NNN had mortgages payable, including unamortized premium and net of unamortized debt costs, of $11,395,000 and $12,059,000 respectively. The mortgages payable had an interest rate of 5.23% and matures July 2023. The loan is secured by a first lien on five of the Properties and the carrying value of the assets was $19,458,000 as of December 31, 2020.\nNotes Payable.

Proceeds from the issuance of the 2028 Notes and the 2048 Notes were also used to redeem all of the $300,000 5.500% notes payable that were due 2021. Proceeds from the issuance of the 2030 Notes and the 2050 Notes were also used to redeem all of the $325,000 3.800% notes payable that were due in 2022.\n(2)The note discounts are amortized to interest expense over the respective term of each debt obligation using the effective interest method.\n(3)Includes the effects of the discount at issuance.\nNNN entered into forward starting swaps which were hedging the risk of changes in forecasted interest payments on the forecasted issuance of long-term debt. Upon the issuance of a series of unsecured notes, NNN terminated such derivatives as outlined in the following table (dollars in thousands):\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes </td> <td> </td> <td>Terminated </td> <td> </td> <td>Description </td> <td> </td> <td>Aggregate Notional Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Liability (Asset) Fair Value When Terminated (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value Deferred In Other Comprehensive Income(2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>April 2013 </td> <td> </td> <td>Four forward starting swaps </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>240,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,141 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>May 2014 </td> <td> </td> <td>Three forward starting swaps </td> <td> </td> <td>225,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,312 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,312 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>October 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>Four forward starting swaps </td> <td> </td> <td>300,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,369 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,369 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2026 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>Two forward starting swaps </td> <td> </td> <td>180,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13,352) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13,345) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2027 </td> <td> </td> <td>September 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>Two forward starting swaps </td> <td> </td> <td>250,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,688 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2028 </td> <td> </td> <td>September 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Two forward starting swaps </td> <td> </td> <td>250,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,080) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,080) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2030 </td> <td> </td> <td>March 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Three forward starting swaps </td> <td> </td> <td>200,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,141 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,141 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)The deferred liability (asset) is being amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest method.\n(2)The amount reported in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the related notes payable.\nEach series of notes represents senior, unsecured obligations of NNN and is subordinated to all secured debt of NNN. The notes are redeemable at the option of NNN, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the sum of (i) the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon through the redemption date, and (ii) the make-whole amount, if any, as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture relating to the notes.\nIn connection with the outstanding note offerings, NNN incurred debt issuance costs totaling $31,140,000 consisting primarily of underwriting discounts and commissions, legal and accounting fees, rating agency fees and printing expenses. Debt issuance costs for all note issuances have been deferred and are being amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest method.\nIn March 2020, NNN redeemed the $325,000,000 3.800% notes payable that were due in October 2022. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount of $16,679,000, and (ii) all accrued and unpaid interest.\nIn accordance with the terms of the indentures pursuant to which NNN's notes have been issued, NNN is required to meet certain restrictive financial covenants, which, among other things, require NNN to maintain (i) certain leverage ratios, and (ii) certain interest coverage. At December 31, 2020, NNN was in compliance with those covenants. NNN's failure to comply with certain of its debt covenants could result in defaults that accelerate the payment under such debt and limit the dividends paid to NNN's common and preferred stockholders which would likely have a material adverse impact on NNN's financial condition and results of operations. In addition, these defaults could impair its access to the debt and equity markets.\nNNN does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes or currently have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges. NNN had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at December 31, 2020.\nDebt and Equity Securities\nNNN has used, and expects to use in the future, issuances of debt and equity securities primarily to pay down its outstanding debt and to finance acquisitions. In August 2020, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Commission which was automatically effective and permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities.\nA description of NNN's outstanding series of publicly held notes is found under Debt - Notes Payable\u201d above.\nNNN completed the following underwritten public offering of cumulative redeemable preferred stock that is still outstanding (\"Preferred Stock Shares\") (dollars in thousands, except per share data):\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Series </td> <td> </td> <td>Dividend Rate(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Issued </td> <td> </td> <td>Depositary Shares Outstanding(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Gross Proceeds </td> <td> </td> <td>Stock Issuance Costs(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Dividend Per Depositary Share </td> <td> </td> <td>Earliest Redemption Date </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Series F(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>5.200 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>October 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>13,800,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>345,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,897 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.300000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>October 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Holders are entitled to receive, when and as authorized by the Board of Directors, cumulative preferential cash dividends.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2) Representing 1/100th of a preferred share.

In addition, upon a change of control, as defined in the articles supplementary fixing the rights and preferences of the Preferred Stock Shares, NNN may redeem the Preferred Stock Shares underlying the depositary shares at a redemption price of $2,500.00 per share (or $25.00 per depositary share), plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends, and in limited circumstances the holders of depositary shares may convert some or all of their Preferred Stock Shares into shares of NNN's common stock at conversion rates provided in the related articles supplementary. As of February 11, 2021, the Preferred Stock Shares were not redeemable.\nIn October 2019, NNN redeemed all outstanding depositary shares (11,500,000) representing interests in its 5.700% Series E Preferred Stock. The Series E preferred stock was redeemed at $25.00 per depositary share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends through, but not including, the redemption date, for an aggregate redemption price of $25.079167 per depositary share. The excess carrying amount of preferred stock redeemed over the cash paid to redeem the preferred stock was $9,856,000 of issuance costs.\nFirm Commitment Underwritten Common Stock Issuances. In September 2019, NNN filed a prospectus supplement to the prospectus contained in its February 2018 shelf registration statement and issued 7,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $56.50 per share and received net proceeds of $379,410,000. In connection with this offering, NNN incurred stock issuance costs totaling approximately $16,090,000, consisting primarily of underwriters' fees and commissions, legal and accounting fees and printing expenses. NNN used the net proceeds from this offering to redeem the Series E preferred stock, repay outstanding debt under the Credit Facility, to fund property acquisitions, and for general corporate purposes.\nAt-The-Market Offerings. Under NNN's shelf registration statement, NNN has established an ATM which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time.

NNN's interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives, NNN borrows at both fixed and variable rates on its long-term debt. As of December 31, 2020, NNN had no outstanding derivatives.\nThe information in the table below summarizes NNN's market risks associated with its debt obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The table presents principal payments and related interest rates by year for debt obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2020. NNN has a variable interest rate risk on its Credit Facility which had no outstanding balance as of December 31, 2020 and $133,600,000 as of December 31, 2019. The weighted average rate for the Credit Facility for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 2.6%. The table incorporates only those debt obligations that existed as of December 31, 2020, and it does not consider those debt obligations or positions which could arise after this date and therefore has limited predictive value. As a result, NNN's ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, NNN's hedging strategies at that time and interest rates. If interest rates on NNN's variable rate debt increased by one percent, NNN's interest expense would have increased by less than one percent for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt Obligations (dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fixed Rate Debt </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Mortgages(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Unsecured Debt(2)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Debt\nObligation </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted\nAverage\nInterest Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Debt\nObligation </td> <td> </td> <td>Effective\nInterest\nRate </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>716 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.23% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.23% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,968 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.23% </td> <td> </td> <td>349,327 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.39% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2024 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>349,726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.92% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>399,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.03% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>2,132,812 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.68% </td> <td>(3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,434 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.23% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,231,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.72% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair Value: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,434 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,532,908 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,116 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,074,538 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)NNN's mortgages payable represent principal payments by year and include unamortized premiums and exclude debt costs.\n(2)Includes NNN's notes payable, each exclude debt costs and are net of unamortized discounts.

NNN has made an election to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), and related regulations and intends to continue to operate so as to remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. NNN generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that it distributes to its stockholders, provided that it distributes 100 percent of its REIT taxable income and meets certain other requirements for qualifying as a REIT. If NNN fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four years following the year during which qualification is lost.

The rent deferral lease amendments required the deferred rents to be repaid at a later time during the lease term. Approximately $3,259,000 of the deferred rent was repaid in 2020.

Rental revenues for properties under construction commence upon completion of construction of the leased asset and delivery of the leased asset to the tenant. Rental revenues for non-development real estate assets are recognized when earned in accordance with the FASB guidance included in Leases, based on the terms of the lease of the leased asset. Lease termination fees are recognized when collected subsequent to the related lease that is cancelled and NNN no longer has continuing involvement with the former tenant with respect to that property.\nNNN generally monitors the financial performance of its significant tenants on an ongoing basis.\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt Obligations (dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fixed Rate Debt </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Mortgages(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Unsecured Debt(2)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Debt\nObligation </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted\nAverage\nInterest Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Debt\nObligation </td> <td> </td> <td>Effective\nInterest\nRate </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>716 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.23% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.23% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,968 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.23% </td> <td> </td> <td>349,327 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.39% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2024 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>349,726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.92% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>399,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.03% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>2,132,812 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.68% </td> <td>(3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,434 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.23% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,231,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.72% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair Value: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,434 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,532,908 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,116 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,074,538 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBusiness Continuity.

The loan is secured by a first lien on five of the Properties and the carrying value of the assets was $19,458,000 as of December 31, 2020.\n(ii)a full year of Rental Revenue from 210 Properties with a gross leasable area of approximately 3,164,000 square feet acquired in 2019.\n\nDividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. In February 2018, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Commission for its DRIP which permits the issuance by NNN of up to 10,000,000 shares of common stock. NNN's DRIP provides an economical and convenient way for current stockholders and other interested new investors to invest in NNN's common stock. The following outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to the DRIP for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands):\nAs of December 31, 2020, NNN owned 47 vacant, un-leased Properties which accounted for approximately one percent of total Properties held in the Property Portfolio.\nRefer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 filed with the Commission on February 11, 2020, for a detailed comparison of expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 versus December 31, 2018.\nRent collections may continue below amounts required under the leases. Rent collections for the year ended December 31, 2020 may not be indicative of rent collections in the future.\nImpairment - Real Estate. Based upon certain events or changes in circumstances, management periodically assesses its Properties for possible impairment whenever the carrying value of the asset, including accrued rental income, may not be recoverable through operations. Events or circumstances that may occur include changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, and the ability to sell properties at a price that exceeds NNN's carrying value. Management evaluates whether an impairment in carrying value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying value of the individual asset. The future undiscounted cash flows are primarily driven by estimated future market rents. Future cash flow estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made by management regarding future market rents, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN's Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, which provide for cash flows over this term. NNN intends to hold these assets for the long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to COVID-19 alone would not be an indicator of impairment.\n(2)The amount reported in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the related notes payable.\nComparison of Revenues - 2019 versus 2018\nThe following table summarizes the diversification of the Property Portfolio based on the top 20 lines of trade:\nNNN's DRIP shelf registration statement expires in February 2021; however, NNN intends to file a new registration statement in order to continue providing current stockholders and other interested new investors an economical and convenient way to invest in NNN's common stock to raise equity capital.\n\nNNN, a Maryland corporation, is a fully integrated real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") formed in 1984. NNN's assets are primarily real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and are primarily held for investment (\"Properties,\" or \"Property Portfolio,\" or individually a \"Property\").\nexcluded from ASU 2014-09, including lease contracts within the scope of the FASB guidance included in Leases (Topic 842). NNN determined the key revenue stream impacted by ASU 2014-09 is gain on disposition of real estate reported on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. In accordance with ASU 2014-09, NNN evaluates any separate contracts or performance obligations to determine proper timing and/or amount of revenue recognition, as well as, transaction price allocation.\n\nA prolonged continuation of business closures, reduced capacity at businesses or other social-distancing practices as a result of COVID-19 may adversely impact NNN's tenants' ability to generate sufficient revenues to meet financial obligations, and could force tenants to default on their leases, or result in the bankruptcy of tenants, which would diminish the rental revenue NNN receives under its leases. The rapid development and fluidity of the pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact on NNN (See \"Overview - Impact of COVID-19 on NNN's Business\").\nThe Preferred Stock Shares underlying the depositary shares rank senior to NNN's common stock with respect to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of NNN. The Preferred Stock Shares have no maturity date and will remain outstanding unless redeemed. In addition, upon a change of control, as defined in the articles supplementary fixing the rights and preferences of the Preferred Stock Shares, NNN may redeem the Preferred Stock Shares underlying the depositary shares at a redemption price of $2,500.00 per share (or $25.00 per depositary share), plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends, and in limited circumstances the holders of depositary shares may convert some or all of their Preferred Stock Shares into shares of NNN's common stock at conversion rates provided in the related articles supplementary. As of February 11, 2021, the Preferred Stock Shares were not redeemable.\n(3)NNN is a lessee for its headquarters office lease.\nImpact of Inflation\n\nNNN typically funds Property acquisitions either through borrowings under the Credit Facility or by issuing its debt or equity securities in the capital markets.\nGeneral. NNN's total revenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period ended in 2019. The decrease is primarily due to the write-off of receivables and lower rent collection from certain tenants due to the pandemic impact. NNN's total revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period ended in 2018. The increase is primarily due to the increase in rental income from Property acquisitions (See \"Results of Operations - Property Analysis - Property Acquisitions\").\n(ii) Issuance of common stock resulted in the following net proceeds:\n\n\nAdditionally, as of February 10, 2021, less than two percent of total Properties, and approximately one percent of aggregate gross leasable area held in the Property Portfolio, was leased to two tenants that are currently in bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. As a result, these tenants have the right to reject or affirm their leases with NNN.\nAnalysis of Revenue\n\nRetirement Severance Costs. For the year ended December 31, 2020, retirement severance costs relate primarily to the retirement of NNN's former Chief Investment Officer on December 31, 2020.\n\u2022$119,185,000 from the issuance of 3,119,153 shares of common stock in connection with the at-the-market (\"ATM\") equity program; and\nAs of December 31, 2020, NNN did not have any other material contractual cash obligations, such as purchase obligations, financing lease obligations or other long-term liabilities other than those reflected in the table. In addition to items reflected in the table, NNN has issued preferred stock with cumulative preferential cash distributions, as described below under Dividends.\u201d\nA prolonged continuation of business closures, reduced capacity at businesses or other social-distancing practices may adversely impact NNN's tenants' ability to generate sufficient revenues to meet financial obligations, and could force tenants to default on their leases, or result in the bankruptcy of tenants, which would diminish the rental revenue NNN receives under its leases. Additionally, an increase in the number of vacant properties would increase NNN's real estate expenses, including expenses associated with ongoing maintenance and repairs, utilities, property taxes and property and liability insurance.\nIn accordance with the terms of the indentures pursuant to which NNN's notes have been issued, NNN is required to meet certain restrictive financial covenants, which, among other things, require NNN to maintain (i) certain leverage ratios, and (ii) certain interest coverage. At December 31, 2020, NNN was in compliance with those covenants. NNN's failure to comply with certain of its debt covenants could result in defaults that accelerate the payment under such debt and limit the dividends paid to NNN's common and preferred stockholders which would likely have a material adverse impact on NNN's financial condition and results of operations. In addition, these defaults could impair its access to the debt and equity markets.\nThe following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for NNN's common stock for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands, except per share data):\nItem7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nComparison of Expenses - 2020 versus 2019\nNNN typically uses the proceeds from a Property disposition to either pay down the Credit Facility or reinvest in real estate.\n(1)Includes rental income from operating leases, earned income from direct financing leases and percentage rent (\"Rental Revenues\").\nLiquidity\nNNN owned 3,143 Properties with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 32,461,000 square feet, located in 48 states, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.7 years as of December 31, 2020. Approximately 99 percent of the Properties were leased as of December 31, 2020.\nImpairment Losses - Real Estate, Net of Recoveries. NNN reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that may occur include changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, and the ability to sell properties at a price that exceeds NNN's carrying value. Management evaluates whether an impairment in value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying cost of the individual asset. The future undiscounted cash flows are primarily driven by estimated future market rents. Future cash flow estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made by management regarding future market rents, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. Generally, NNN's Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, which provide for cash flows over this term. NNN intends to hold these assets for the long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to COVID-19 alone would not be an indicator of impairment. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, NNN recorded $37,442,000 and $31,992,000, respectively, of real estate impairments, net of recoveries.\n(iii) Dividends paid:\nWhile the total impact of the economic downturn are unknown, NNN expects to meet short-term liquidity requirements through cash and cash equivalents, cash provided from operations and NNN's Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020, NNN had $267,236,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $900,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility. NNN moderated new property investments during 2020 in order to better gauge the impact of the economic downturn on retailers, retail real estate, capital markets and investment returns. NNN will continue to monitor the impact of the economic downturn, among other things, when considering new property investments in 2021. (See \"Overview - Impact of COVID-19 on NNN's Business\").\nForward-Looking Statements\nComparison of Revenues - 2020 versus 2019\nThe fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions, such as establishing a range of relevant market assumptions for land, building and rent and where the acquired property falls within that range. These market assumptions for land, building\nProperty Dispositions. The following table summarizes the Properties sold by NNN for each of the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands):\nEach series of notes represents senior, unsecured obligations of NNN and is subordinated to all secured debt of NNN. The notes are redeemable at the option of NNN, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the sum of (i) the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon through the redemption date, and (ii) the make-whole amount, if any, as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture relating to the notes.\n(i) Issuance and redemption of notes payable resulted in the following:\nThe term \"NNN\" or the \"Company\" refers to National Retail Properties, Inc. and all of its consolidated subsidiaries. NNN may elect to treat certain subsidiaries as taxable real estate investment trust subsidiaries, (\"TRS\").\nLease Accounting. In accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842),\" (\"ASC 842\"), NNN recorded right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and operating lease liabilities of approximately $7,735,000 and $10,155,000 respectively, as of January 1, 2019.\n(1)Based on annualized base rent for all leases in place as of December 31, 2020.\n\nThe following table summarizes the lease expirations, assuming none of the tenants exercise renewal options, of the Property Portfolio for each of the next 10 years and then thereafter in the aggregate as of December 31, 2020:\nAs a result, the COVID-19 pandemic and the government reaction to it is negatively affecting almost every industry directly or indirectly. A number of NNN's tenants have announced temporary closures of their operations and/or have requested adjustments to their lease terms during this pandemic. The actions taken by the government to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 by, at certain times, ordering closure of, or reducing capacity at, many businesses and ordering residents to generally stay at home has resulted in the loss of revenue for many of NNN's tenants and challenged their ability to pay rent. As a result, these economic hardships have increased uncertainty with respect to the collectability of lease payments and have had a negative effect on NNN's financial results, including increased accounts receivables and related allowances and recognizing revenue on a cash basis from certain of its tenants.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. In March 2020, NNN redeemed the $325,000,000 3.800% notes payable that were due in October 2022. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount of $16,679,000, and (ii) all accrued and unpaid interest.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. NNN makes statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in this report entitled Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Certain risks may cause NNN's actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion. For a discussion of such risk factors, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nrespectively. The decrease in real estate expenses, net of reimbursements from tenants, is primarily attributable to vacant properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2020, offset by the write-off of reimbursements from certain tenants.\nGenerally, cash needs for Property acquisitions, debt payments, capital expenditures, development and other investments have been funded by equity and debt offerings, bank borrowings, the sale of Properties and, to a lesser extent, by internally generated funds. Cash needs for operating and interest expenses and dividends have generally been funded by internally generated funds. If available, future sources of capital include proceeds from the public or private offering of NNN's debt or equity securities, secured or unsecured borrowings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from the sale of Properties, as well as undistributed funds from operations.\n(2)The note discounts are amortized to interest expense over the respective term of each debt obligation using the effective interest method.\nNotes Payable. Each of NNN's outstanding series of unsecured notes is summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands):\nNNN moderated new property investments during 2020 in order to better gauge the impact of the economic downturn on retailers, retail real estate, capital markets and investment returns. NNN will continue to monitor the impact of the economic downturn, among other things, when considering new property investments in 2021. As of December 31, 2020, NNN had $267,236,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $900,000,000 available for borrowings under its unsecured revolving credit facility (the \"Credit Facility\"). While the impacts of COVID-19 are still unfolding, NNN currently expects these combined resources, in addition to the cash provided by NNN's operations to be sufficient to meet NNN's demand for funds.\nA description of NNN's outstanding series of publicly held notes is found under Debt - Notes Payable\u201d above.\n(1)Based on the annualized base rent for all leases in place as of December 31, 2020.\n(1)Based on annualized base rent for all leases in place as of December 31 of the respective year.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased modestly in amount and as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, is primarily attributable to an increase in compensation costs, offset by a decrease in other general costs associated with operating NNN's business.\nProperty Analysis\nNew Accounting Pronouncements. Refer to Note 1 of the December 31, 2020, Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary and the anticipated impact of each accounting pronouncement on NNN's financial position or results of operations.\n(3)Weighted average effective interest rate for periods after 2025.\n\n\nThe following presents the characterizations for tax purposes of such common stock dividends for the years ended December 31:\n(1) Stock issuance costs consist primarily of underwriters' and agent's fees and commissions, and legal and\nThe lost revenues and increased property expenses resulting from vacant Properties or uncollectability of lease revenues could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and results of operations if NNN is unable to re-lease the Properties at comparable rental rates and in a timely manner. NNN currently expects a short-term decrease in cash from operations as its tenants are impacted by the pandemic and, while contractually obligated, some have not paid all rent amounts due (See \"Overview - Impact of COVID-19 on NNN's Business\").\n(1)Includes additional square footage from completed construction on existing Properties.\nDebt and Equity Securities\nNNN entered into forward starting swaps which were hedging the risk of changes in forecasted interest payments on the forecasted issuance of long-term debt. Upon the issuance of a series of unsecured notes, NNN terminated such derivatives as outlined in the following table (dollars in thousands):\nThe following table summarizes the diversification of the Property Portfolio by state as of December 31, 2020:\n\nReal Estate - Held For Sale. Real estate held for sale is not depreciated and is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, less costs to sell.\nRental Income. Rental income decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease is primarily due to the write-off of $21,793,000 of receivables due to reclassifying certain tenants as cash basis for accounting purposes and the lower probability of collecting rent from certain tenants due to the pandemic impact. The decrease in rental income for the year ended December 31, 2020 is partially offset by an increase in Rental Revenue due to Property acquisitions:\npremiums, note discounts and note costs. See \"Debt - Mortgages Payable\" and \"Debt - Notes Payable\".\n\nFinancing Strategy. NNN's financing objective is to manage its capital structure effectively in order to provide sufficient capital to execute its operating strategy while servicing its debt requirements, maintaining its investment grade credit rating, staggering debt maturities and providing value to NNN's stockholders. NNN generally utilizes debt and equity security offerings, bank borrowings, proceeds from the disposition of certain properties, and to a lesser extent, internally generated funds to meet its capital needs.\nNNN is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of its variable rate Credit Facility and its fixed rate debt which is used to finance NNN's development and acquisition activities, as well as for general corporate purposes. NNN's interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives, NNN borrows at both fixed and variable rates on its long-term debt. As of December 31, 2020, NNN had no outstanding derivatives.\nIn connection with the outstanding note offerings, NNN incurred debt issuance costs totaling $31,140,000 consisting primarily of underwriting discounts and commissions, legal and accounting fees, rating agency fees and printing expenses. Debt issuance costs for all note issuances have been deferred and are being amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest method.\nThe following summarizes NNN's revenues for each of the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands):\nThis section generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this annual report on Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 filed with the Commission on February 11, 2020.\nCapital Resources\n\nLine of Credit Payable. NNN's $900,000,000 Credit Facility had a weighted average outstanding balance of $18,895,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 2.6% during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Credit Facility matures January 2022, unless the Company exercises its option to extend maturity to January 2023. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature for NNN to increase the facility size up to $1,600,000,000, subject to lender approval. In May 2020, NNN amended its Credit Facility to include the addition of new terms and definitions, and to restate certain other definitions under the former unsecured revolving credit agreement, some of which modified the financial covenant calculations. As of December 31, 2020, there was no outstanding balance and $900,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility.\nHolders of NNN's preferred stock issuances are entitled to receive, when and as authorized by the Board of Directors, cumulative preferential cash distributions based on the stated rate and liquidation preference per annum. The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for NNN's preferred stock for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands, except per share data):\nThe following table details the rental revenue collected as of January 31, 2021, excluding the repayment of amounts previously deferred according to the rent deferral lease amendments for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 as a percentage of annualized base rent:\n(4)NNN is a lessee for three ground lease arrangements.\n(2)Includes NNN's notes payable, each exclude debt costs and are net of unamortized discounts. NNN uses market prices quoted from Bloomberg, a third party, which is a Level 1 input, to determine the fair value.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately six percent of total Properties, and approximately eight percent aggregate gross leasable area held in the Property Portfolio, were leased to 13 tenants that NNN has determined to recognize revenue on a cash basis. During the year ended December 31, 2020, NNN recognized $4,722,000 of rental income from certain tenants for periods following their classification to cash basis for accounting. NNN did not recognize any such revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nThe increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was partially offset by a decrease of $5,163,000 in the weighted average outstanding balance, and a 20 basis points decrease in the interest rate, on the Credit Facility for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The Credit Facility had a weighted average outstanding balance of $18,895,000 and $24,058,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, includes $2,291,000 in connection with the early redemption of the 2022 Notes described below.\nThe information in the table below summarizes NNN's market risks associated with its debt obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The table presents principal payments and related interest rates by year for debt obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2020. NNN has a variable interest rate risk on its Credit Facility which had no outstanding balance as of December 31, 2020 and $133,600,000 as of December 31, 2019. The weighted average rate for the Credit Facility for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 2.6%. The table incorporates only those debt obligations that existed as of December 31, 2020, and it does not consider those debt obligations or positions which could arise after this date and therefore has limited predictive value. As a result, NNN's ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, NNN's hedging strategies at that time and interest rates. If interest rates on NNN's variable rate debt increased by one percent, NNN's interest expense would have increased by less than one percent for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAnalysis of Expenses\n\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. The information in the following table summarizes NNN's contractual obligations and commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2020. The table presents principal cash flows by year-end of the expected maturity for debt obligations and commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2020.\nOn January 15, 2021, NNN declared a dividend of $0.520 per share, payable February 16, 2021, to its common stockholders of record as of January 29, 2021.\naccounting fees.\nOverview. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a novel strain of coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. Since that time, efforts taken in an attempt to contain the spread of COVID-19 have intensified. Several countries, including the United States, have taken steps to restrict travel, temporarily close businesses and issue quarantine orders, and it remains unclear how long such measures will remain in place.\nChanges in cash for investing activities are primarily attributable to acquisitions and dispositions of Properties. NNN typically uses cash on hand or proceeds from its Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of its Properties.\nNNN's leases typically contain provisions to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on NNN's results of operations. Tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of fixed increases, increases in the CPI, and/or, to a lesser extent, increases in the tenant's sales volume. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, rent increases will not keep up with the rate of inflation.\nand rent use the most relevant comparable properties for an acquisition. The final range relies upon ranking comparable properties' attributes from most similar to least similar.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nImpact of COVID-19 on NNN's Business\n\n\u2022$290,459,000 in net proceeds from the issuance in March of the 3.100% notes payable due in April 2050,\n(2)Includes dollars invested in projects under construction or tenant improvements for each respective year.\nIn addition to the contractual obligations outlined above, NNN has committed to fund construction on five Properties. The improvements on such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months. These construction commitments, at December 31, 2020, are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands):\nManagement anticipates satisfying these obligations with a combination of NNN's cash provided from operations, current capital resources on hand, its Credit Facility, debt or equity financings and asset dispositions.\nDebt\nComparison of Expenses - 2019 versus 2018\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased in amount for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The increase in depreciation and amortization expenses is primarily due to a partial year of depreciation from 63 Properties with aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 449,000 square feet acquired in 2020, and a full year of depreciation from 210 Properties with a gross leasable area of approximately 3,164,000 square feet acquired in 2019.\nAt-The-Market Offerings. Under NNN's shelf registration statement, NNN has established an ATM which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time. The following table outlines NNN's active ATM programs for the three years ended December 31, 2020:\n(1)The proceeds from the note issuance were used to pay down outstanding debt of NNN's Credit Facility, fund future property acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. Proceeds from the issuance of the 2028 Notes and the 2048 Notes were also used to redeem all of the $300,000 5.500% notes payable that were due 2021. Proceeds from the issuance of the 2030 Notes and the 2050 Notes were also used to redeem all of the $325,000 3.800% notes payable that were due in 2022.\nItem 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIn accordance with ASC 842, NNN reviews the collectability of its lease payments on an ongoing basis. NNN considers collectability indicators when analyzing accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends, all of which assists in evaluating the probability of outstanding and future lease payment collections. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and considerations are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition bankruptcy claims. At the point NNN deems the collection of lease payments not probable, previously recognized rental revenue is reversed and any related accrued rent and, subsequently, any lease revenue is only recognized when cash receipts are received. As a result of the review of lease payments collectability, NNN recorded a write-off of $21,792,000 of outstanding receivables and related accrued rent during the year ended December 31, 2020, and reclassified certain tenants as cash basis for accounting purposes.\n\u2022$395,062,000 in net proceeds from the issuance in March of the 2.500% notes payable due in April 2030,\nIn April 2020, the FASB issued interpretive guidance relating to the accounting for lease concessions provided as a result of COVID-19. In this guidance, entities can elect not to apply lease modification accounting with respect to such lease concessions and instead, treat the concession as if it was a part of the existing contract. This guidance is only applicable to COVID-19 related lease concessions that do not result in a substantial increase in the rights of the lessor or the obligations of the lessee. NNN elected to make this policy election for COVID-19 lease concessions, including the rent deferral lease amendments effective during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNNN has used, and expects to use in the future, issuances of debt and equity securities primarily to pay down its outstanding debt and to finance acquisitions. In August 2020, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Commission which was automatically effective and permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities.\n\u2022$5,092,000 from the issuance of 138,507 shares of common stock in connection with the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan ( DRIP\u201d).\nCash provided by operating activities represents cash received primarily from Rental Revenues and interest income less cash used for general and administrative expenses. NNN's cash flow from operating activities has been sufficient to pay the distributions for each period presented. The change in cash provided by operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, is primarily the result of changes in revenues and expenses as discussed in Results of Operations.\u201d Cash generated from operations is expected to fluctuate in the future.\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Property Portfolio remained at least 98 percent leased and had a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 11 years. High occupancy levels coupled with a net lease structure, provides enhanced probability of maintaining operating earnings.\n\nNNN does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes or currently have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges. NNN had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at December 31, 2020.\nGenerally, the Properties are leased under long-term triple net leases, which require the tenant to pay all property taxes and assessments, to maintain the interior and exterior of the Property, and to carry property and liability insurance coverage. Therefore, management anticipates that capital demands to meet obligations with respect to these Properties will be modest for the foreseeable future and can be met with funds from operations and working capital. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses associated with the Property. Management anticipates the costs associated with these Properties, NNN's vacant Properties or those Properties that become vacant will also be met with funds from operations and working capital. NNN may be required to borrow under its Credit Facility or use other sources of capital in the event of significant capital expenditures or major repairs.\n(2)Approximate square feet.\nThe following is a summary of NNN's total outstanding debt as of December 31 (dollars in thousands):\nRefer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 filed with the Commission on February 11, 2020, for a detailed comparison of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 versus December 31, 2018.\nIn October 2019, NNN redeemed all outstanding depositary shares (11,500,000) representing interests in its 5.700% Series E Preferred Stock. The Series E preferred stock was redeemed at $25.00 per depositary share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends through, but not including, the redemption date, for an aggregate redemption price of $25.079167 per depositary share. The excess carrying amount of preferred stock redeemed over the cash paid to redeem the preferred stock was $9,856,000 of issuance costs.\nNNN continues to maintain its diversification by tenant, geography and tenant's line of trade. NNN's largest lines of trade concentrations are the convenience store and restaurant (including full and limited service) sectors. These sectors represent a large part of the freestanding retail property marketplace and NNN's management believes these sectors present attractive investment opportunities. The Property Portfolio is geographically concentrated in the south and southeast United States, which are regions of historically above-average population growth. Given these concentrations, any financial hardship within these sectors or geographic regions could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operating performance of NNN.\n\n\nThe following presents the characterizations for tax purposes of such preferred stock dividends for the years ended December 31:\nIn accordance with the terms of the Credit Facility, NNN is required to meet certain restrictive financial covenants, which, among other things, require NNN to maintain certain (i) leverage ratios, (ii) debt service coverage, (iii) cash flow coverage, and (iv) investment limitations. At December 31, 2020, NNN was in compliance with those covenants. In the event that NNN violates any of these restrictive financial covenants, it could cause the debt under the Credit Facility to be accelerated and may impair NNN's access to the debt and equity markets and limit NNN's ability to pay dividends to its common and preferred stockholders, each of which would likely have a material adverse impact on NNN's financial condition and results of operations.\n\n(i)a partial year of Rental Revenue from 63 Properties with aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 449,000 square feet acquired in 2020, and\nNNN evaluates the creditworthiness of its current and prospective tenants. This evaluation may include reviewing available financial statements, store level financial performance, press releases, public credit ratings from major credit rating agencies, industry news publications and financial market data (debt and equity pricing). NNN may also evaluate the business and operations of its tenants, including past payment history and periodically meeting with senior management of certain tenants.\nFirm Commitment Underwritten Common Stock Issuances. In September 2019, NNN filed a prospectus supplement to the prospectus contained in its February 2018 shelf registration statement and issued 7,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $56.50 per share and received net proceeds of $379,410,000. In connection with this offering, NNN incurred stock issuance costs totaling approximately $16,090,000, consisting primarily of underwriters' fees and commissions, legal and accounting fees and printing expenses. NNN used the net proceeds from this offering to redeem the Series E preferred stock, repay outstanding debt under the Credit Facility, to fund property acquisitions, and for general corporate purposes.\nNNN's management team focuses on certain key indicators to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. The key indicators for NNN include items such as: the composition of the Property Portfolio (such as tenant, geographic and line of trade diversification), the occupancy rate of the Property Portfolio, certain financial performance ratios and profitability measures, industry trends and industry performance compared to that of NNN.\n\u2022$325,000,000 payment in March for the early redemption of the 3.800% notes payable due in October 2022, and\n", "item_7_text": "Interest Expense. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. The increase is attributable to an increase in outstanding debt, including the following activity related to NNN's notes payable (dollars in thousands):\nThe rapid development and fluidity of the economic downturn precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact on the economy, retailing and NNN and will ultimately depend on future developments, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. Nevertheless, the economic downturn presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to NNN's performance, business or financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Item \"1A. Risk Factors.\"\n(2)Interest calculation on mortgage and notes payable based on stated rate of the principal amount. See \"Debt - Mortgages Payable\" and \"Debt - Notes Payable\".\nDividends. NNN has made an election to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), and related regulations and intends to continue to operate so as to remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. NNN generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that it distributes to its stockholders, provided that it distributes 100 percent of its REIT taxable income and meets certain other requirements for qualifying as a REIT. If NNN fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four years following the year during which qualification is lost. Such an event could materially adversely affect NNN's income and ability to pay dividends. NNN believes it has been structured as, and its past and present operations qualify NNN as, a REIT.\nNNN completed the following underwritten public offering of cumulative redeemable preferred stock that is still outstanding (\"Preferred Stock Shares\") (dollars in thousands, except per share data):\nReal Estate Portfolio. NNN records the acquisition of real estate at cost, including acquisition and closing costs. The cost of properties developed or funded by NNN includes direct and indirect costs of construction, property taxes, interest and other miscellaneous costs incurred during the development period until the project is substantially complete and available for occupancy.\nProperty Acquisitions. The following table summarizes the Property acquisitions for each of the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands):\n(3)Includes the effects of the discount at issuance.\nPurchase Accounting for Acquisition of Real Estate. In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") guidance on business combinations, consideration for the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and tenant improvements and, if applicable, to identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases and value of in-place leases, as applicable, based on their respective fair values.\n\n(1)Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs and capitalized interest\n(1)NNN's mortgages payable represent principal payments by year and include unamortized premiums and exclude debt costs.\nNNN includes an allowance for doubtful accounts in rental income on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.\nGeneral. Operating expenses increased primarily due to the increase in depreciation and amortization expense and impairment losses recognized on real estate during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The following summarizes NNN's expenses for the year ended December 31 (dollars in thousands):\nNNN expects to use debt primarily for property acquisitions and development of single-tenant retail properties, either directly or through investment interests. Additionally, debt may be used to refinance existing debt.\nThe core principle of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\", is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Certain contracts are\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, NNN entered into rent deferral lease amendments with certain tenants for an aggregate $50,719,000 and $1,410,000 of rent originally due for the year ending December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. The rent deferral lease amendments required the deferred rents to be repaid at a later time during the lease term. Approximately $3,259,000 of the deferred rent was repaid in 2020. Deferred rents of $36,794,000, $10,944,000 and $1,132,000 are due to be repaid during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. Depending upon the duration of impact on tenants and the overall economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, future rent payments including deferred rents may be difficult to collect. Additionally, rent collections and rent relief requests for the year ended December 31, 2020 may not be indicative of rent collections and requests in the future.\n\nThe preparation of NNN's consolidated financial statements in conformance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as other disclosures in the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions, which in turn could have a material impact on NNN's financial statements. A summary of NNN's accounting policies and procedures are included in Note 1 of NNN's consolidated financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of NNN's consolidated financial statements.\n\nNNN anticipates its long-term capital needs will be funded by the Credit Facility, cash provided from operations, the issuance of long-term debt or the issuance of common or preferred equity or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable for common or preferred equity. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing or capital will be available, or that the terms will be acceptable or advantageous to NNN.\nAs of January 31, 2021, NNN had collected approximately 96% of rent originally due in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 and approximately 95% of rent originally due in January 2021.\nResults of Operations\n(1)Includes only principal amounts outstanding under mortgages payable and notes payable and excludes unamortized mortgage\n\u2022$16,679,000 payment in March of the make-whole amount for the early redemption of the 3.800% notes payable due in October 2022.\nGeneral. NNN's demand for funds has been and will continue to be primarily for (i) payment of operating expenses and cash dividends; (ii) Property acquisitions and development; (iii) capital expenditures; (iv) payment of principal and interest on its outstanding debt; and (v) other investments.\nThe following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity programs for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands, except per share data):\n\u2022$356,409,000 to common stockholders; and\n(1) Not calculable\nGeneral. The following table summarizes the Property Portfolio as of December 31:\n(1)The deferred liability (asset) is being amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest method.\nAs of December 31, 2020, NNN's ratio of total debt to total gross assets (before accumulated depreciation and amortization) was approximately 34 percent and the ratio of secured debt to total gross assets was less than one percent. The ratio of total debt to total market capitalization was approximately 29 percent. Certain financial agreements to which NNN is a party contain covenants that limit NNN's ability to incur additional debt under certain circumstances. The organizational documents of NNN do not limit the absolute amount or percentage of debt that NNN may incur. Additionally, NNN may change its financing strategy.\nNNN typically funds its short-term liquidity requirements, including investments in additional Properties, with cash from its Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020, there was no outstanding balance and $900,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility.\n(1)Eligible for the 20% qualified business income deduction under section 199A of the Code that was amended by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017, (\"TCJA\").\n\u2022$17,940,000 to holders of the depositary shares of NNN's 5.200% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the \"Series F Preferred Stock\").\nCash and Cash Equivalents. NNN's cash and cash equivalents includes the aggregate of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash held in escrow from the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NNN did not have restricted cash, including cash held in escrow as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The table below summarizes NNN's cash flows for each of the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands):\nOne of NNN's primary objectives is to distribute a substantial portion of its funds available from operations to its stockholders in the form of dividends, while retaining sufficient cash for reserves and working capital purposes and maintaining its status as a REIT.\n\nRevenue Recognition. Rental revenues for properties under construction commence upon completion of construction of the leased asset and delivery of the leased asset to the tenant. Rental revenues for non-development real estate assets are recognized when earned in accordance with the FASB guidance included in Leases, based on the terms of the lease of the leased asset. Lease termination fees are recognized when collected subsequent to the related lease that is cancelled and NNN no longer has continuing involvement with the former tenant with respect to that property.\nNNN generally monitors the financial performance of its significant tenants on an ongoing basis.\nBusiness Continuity. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, NNN has transitioned a large portion of its associates to work remotely without any adverse impact on its ability to continue to operate its business nor has this transition had any material adverse impact on NNN's financial reporting systems, internal controls over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures.\nProperties are leased to tenants under long-term, net leases which typically require the tenant to pay certain operating expenses for a Property, thus, NNN's exposure to inflation is reduced with respect to these expenses. Inflation may have an adverse impact on NNN's tenants.\nReal Estate. Real estate expenses increased in amount and as a percentage of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. NNN focuses on real estate expenses, net of reimbursements from tenants. NNN's net real estate expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $10,323,000 and $10,867,000,\nIn March 2020, NNN redeemed the $325,000,000 3.800% notes payable that were due in October 2022. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount of $16,679,000, and (ii) all accrued and unpaid interest.\nNNN's financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, included the following significant transactions:\n\nMortgages Payable. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, NNN had mortgages payable, including unamortized premium and net of unamortized debt costs, of $11,395,000 and $12,059,000 respectively. The mortgages payable had an interest rate of 5.23% and matures July 2023. The loan is secured by a first lien on five of the Properties and the carrying value of the assets was $19,458,000 as of December 31, 2020.\n(ii)a full year of Rental Revenue from 210 Properties with a gross leasable area of approximately 3,164,000 square feet acquired in 2019.\n\nDividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. In February 2018, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Commission for its DRIP which permits the issuance by NNN of up to 10,000,000 shares of common stock. NNN's DRIP provides an economical and convenient way for current stockholders and other interested new investors to invest in NNN's common stock. The following outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to the DRIP for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands):\nAs of December 31, 2020, NNN owned 47 vacant, un-leased Properties which accounted for approximately one percent of total Properties held in the Property Portfolio.\nRefer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 filed with the Commission on February 11, 2020, for a detailed comparison of expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 versus December 31, 2018.\nRent collections may continue below amounts required under the leases. Rent collections for the year ended December 31, 2020 may not be indicative of rent collections in the future.\nImpairment - Real Estate. Based upon certain events or changes in circumstances, management periodically assesses its Properties for possible impairment whenever the carrying value of the asset, including accrued rental income, may not be recoverable through operations. Events or circumstances that may occur include changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, and the ability to sell properties at a price that exceeds NNN's carrying value. Management evaluates whether an impairment in carrying value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying value of the individual asset. The future undiscounted cash flows are primarily driven by estimated future market rents. Future cash flow estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made by management regarding future market rents, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN's Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, which provide for cash flows over this term. NNN intends to hold these assets for the long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to COVID-19 alone would not be an indicator of impairment.\n(2)The amount reported in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the related notes payable.\nComparison of Revenues - 2019 versus 2018\nThe following table summarizes the diversification of the Property Portfolio based on the top 20 lines of trade:\nNNN's DRIP shelf registration statement expires in February 2021; however, NNN intends to file a new registration statement in order to continue providing current stockholders and other interested new investors an economical and convenient way to invest in NNN's common stock to raise equity capital.\n\nNNN, a Maryland corporation, is a fully integrated real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") formed in 1984. NNN's assets are primarily real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and are primarily held for investment (\"Properties,\" or \"Property Portfolio,\" or individually a \"Property\").\nexcluded from ASU 2014-09, including lease contracts within the scope of the FASB guidance included in Leases (Topic 842). NNN determined the key revenue stream impacted by ASU 2014-09 is gain on disposition of real estate reported on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. In accordance with ASU 2014-09, NNN evaluates any separate contracts or performance obligations to determine proper timing and/or amount of revenue recognition, as well as, transaction price allocation.\n\nA prolonged continuation of business closures, reduced capacity at businesses or other social-distancing practices as a result of COVID-19 may adversely impact NNN's tenants' ability to generate sufficient revenues to meet financial obligations, and could force tenants to default on their leases, or result in the bankruptcy of tenants, which would diminish the rental revenue NNN receives under its leases. The rapid development and fluidity of the pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact on NNN (See \"Overview - Impact of COVID-19 on NNN's Business\").\nThe Preferred Stock Shares underlying the depositary shares rank senior to NNN's common stock with respect to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of NNN. The Preferred Stock Shares have no maturity date and will remain outstanding unless redeemed. In addition, upon a change of control, as defined in the articles supplementary fixing the rights and preferences of the Preferred Stock Shares, NNN may redeem the Preferred Stock Shares underlying the depositary shares at a redemption price of $2,500.00 per share (or $25.00 per depositary share), plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends, and in limited circumstances the holders of depositary shares may convert some or all of their Preferred Stock Shares into shares of NNN's common stock at conversion rates provided in the related articles supplementary. As of February 11, 2021, the Preferred Stock Shares were not redeemable.\n(3)NNN is a lessee for its headquarters office lease.\nImpact of Inflation\n\nNNN typically funds Property acquisitions either through borrowings under the Credit Facility or by issuing its debt or equity securities in the capital markets.\nGeneral. NNN's total revenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period ended in 2019. The decrease is primarily due to the write-off of receivables and lower rent collection from certain tenants due to the pandemic impact. NNN's total revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period ended in 2018. The increase is primarily due to the increase in rental income from Property acquisitions (See \"Results of Operations - Property Analysis - Property Acquisitions\").\n(ii) Issuance of common stock resulted in the following net proceeds:\n\n\nAdditionally, as of February 10, 2021, less than two percent of total Properties, and approximately one percent of aggregate gross leasable area held in the Property Portfolio, was leased to two tenants that are currently in bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. As a result, these tenants have the right to reject or affirm their leases with NNN.\nAnalysis of Revenue\n\nRetirement Severance Costs. For the year ended December 31, 2020, retirement severance costs relate primarily to the retirement of NNN's former Chief Investment Officer on December 31, 2020.\n\u2022$119,185,000 from the issuance of 3,119,153 shares of common stock in connection with the at-the-market (\"ATM\") equity program; and\nAs of December 31, 2020, NNN did not have any other material contractual cash obligations, such as purchase obligations, financing lease obligations or other long-term liabilities other than those reflected in the table. In addition to items reflected in the table, NNN has issued preferred stock with cumulative preferential cash distributions, as described below under Dividends.\u201d\nA prolonged continuation of business closures, reduced capacity at businesses or other social-distancing practices may adversely impact NNN's tenants' ability to generate sufficient revenues to meet financial obligations, and could force tenants to default on their leases, or result in the bankruptcy of tenants, which would diminish the rental revenue NNN receives under its leases. Additionally, an increase in the number of vacant properties would increase NNN's real estate expenses, including expenses associated with ongoing maintenance and repairs, utilities, property taxes and property and liability insurance.\nIn accordance with the terms of the indentures pursuant to which NNN's notes have been issued, NNN is required to meet certain restrictive financial covenants, which, among other things, require NNN to maintain (i) certain leverage ratios, and (ii) certain interest coverage. At December 31, 2020, NNN was in compliance with those covenants. NNN's failure to comply with certain of its debt covenants could result in defaults that accelerate the payment under such debt and limit the dividends paid to NNN's common and preferred stockholders which would likely have a material adverse impact on NNN's financial condition and results of operations. In addition, these defaults could impair its access to the debt and equity markets.\nThe following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for NNN's common stock for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands, except per share data):\nItem7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nComparison of Expenses - 2020 versus 2019\nNNN typically uses the proceeds from a Property disposition to either pay down the Credit Facility or reinvest in real estate.\n(1)Includes rental income from operating leases, earned income from direct financing leases and percentage rent (\"Rental Revenues\").\nLiquidity\nNNN owned 3,143 Properties with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 32,461,000 square feet, located in 48 states, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.7 years as of December 31, 2020. Approximately 99 percent of the Properties were leased as of December 31, 2020.\nImpairment Losses - Real Estate, Net of Recoveries. NNN reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that may occur include changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, and the ability to sell properties at a price that exceeds NNN's carrying value. Management evaluates whether an impairment in value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying cost of the individual asset. The future undiscounted cash flows are primarily driven by estimated future market rents. Future cash flow estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made by management regarding future market rents, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. Generally, NNN's Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, which provide for cash flows over this term. NNN intends to hold these assets for the long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to COVID-19 alone would not be an indicator of impairment. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, NNN recorded $37,442,000 and $31,992,000, respectively, of real estate impairments, net of recoveries.\n(iii) Dividends paid:\nWhile the total impact of the economic downturn are unknown, NNN expects to meet short-term liquidity requirements through cash and cash equivalents, cash provided from operations and NNN's Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020, NNN had $267,236,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $900,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility. NNN moderated new property investments during 2020 in order to better gauge the impact of the economic downturn on retailers, retail real estate, capital markets and investment returns. NNN will continue to monitor the impact of the economic downturn, among other things, when considering new property investments in 2021. (See \"Overview - Impact of COVID-19 on NNN's Business\").\nForward-Looking Statements\nComparison of Revenues - 2020 versus 2019\nThe fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions, such as establishing a range of relevant market assumptions for land, building and rent and where the acquired property falls within that range. These market assumptions for land, building\nProperty Dispositions. The following table summarizes the Properties sold by NNN for each of the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands):\nEach series of notes represents senior, unsecured obligations of NNN and is subordinated to all secured debt of NNN. The notes are redeemable at the option of NNN, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the sum of (i) the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon through the redemption date, and (ii) the make-whole amount, if any, as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture relating to the notes.\n(i) Issuance and redemption of notes payable resulted in the following:\nThe term \"NNN\" or the \"Company\" refers to National Retail Properties, Inc. and all of its consolidated subsidiaries. NNN may elect to treat certain subsidiaries as taxable real estate investment trust subsidiaries, (\"TRS\").\nLease Accounting. In accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842),\" (\"ASC 842\"), NNN recorded right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and operating lease liabilities of approximately $7,735,000 and $10,155,000 respectively, as of January 1, 2019.\n(1)Based on annualized base rent for all leases in place as of December 31, 2020.\n\nThe following table summarizes the lease expirations, assuming none of the tenants exercise renewal options, of the Property Portfolio for each of the next 10 years and then thereafter in the aggregate as of December 31, 2020:\nAs a result, the COVID-19 pandemic and the government reaction to it is negatively affecting almost every industry directly or indirectly. A number of NNN's tenants have announced temporary closures of their operations and/or have requested adjustments to their lease terms during this pandemic. The actions taken by the government to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 by, at certain times, ordering closure of, or reducing capacity at, many businesses and ordering residents to generally stay at home has resulted in the loss of revenue for many of NNN's tenants and challenged their ability to pay rent. As a result, these economic hardships have increased uncertainty with respect to the collectability of lease payments and have had a negative effect on NNN's financial results, including increased accounts receivables and related allowances and recognizing revenue on a cash basis from certain of its tenants.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. In March 2020, NNN redeemed the $325,000,000 3.800% notes payable that were due in October 2022. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount of $16,679,000, and (ii) all accrued and unpaid interest.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. NNN makes statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in this report entitled Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Certain risks may cause NNN's actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion. For a discussion of such risk factors, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nrespectively. The decrease in real estate expenses, net of reimbursements from tenants, is primarily attributable to vacant properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2020, offset by the write-off of reimbursements from certain tenants.\nGenerally, cash needs for Property acquisitions, debt payments, capital expenditures, development and other investments have been funded by equity and debt offerings, bank borrowings, the sale of Properties and, to a lesser extent, by internally generated funds. Cash needs for operating and interest expenses and dividends have generally been funded by internally generated funds. If available, future sources of capital include proceeds from the public or private offering of NNN's debt or equity securities, secured or unsecured borrowings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from the sale of Properties, as well as undistributed funds from operations.\n(2)The note discounts are amortized to interest expense over the respective term of each debt obligation using the effective interest method.\nNotes Payable. Each of NNN's outstanding series of unsecured notes is summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands):\nNNN moderated new property investments during 2020 in order to better gauge the impact of the economic downturn on retailers, retail real estate, capital markets and investment returns. NNN will continue to monitor the impact of the economic downturn, among other things, when considering new property investments in 2021. As of December 31, 2020, NNN had $267,236,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $900,000,000 available for borrowings under its unsecured revolving credit facility (the \"Credit Facility\"). While the impacts of COVID-19 are still unfolding, NNN currently expects these combined resources, in addition to the cash provided by NNN's operations to be sufficient to meet NNN's demand for funds.\nA description of NNN's outstanding series of publicly held notes is found under Debt - Notes Payable\u201d above.\n(1)Based on the annualized base rent for all leases in place as of December 31, 2020.\n(1)Based on annualized base rent for all leases in place as of December 31 of the respective year.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased modestly in amount and as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, is primarily attributable to an increase in compensation costs, offset by a decrease in other general costs associated with operating NNN's business.\nProperty Analysis\nNew Accounting Pronouncements. Refer to Note 1 of the December 31, 2020, Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary and the anticipated impact of each accounting pronouncement on NNN's financial position or results of operations.\n(3)Weighted average effective interest rate for periods after 2025.\n\n\nThe following presents the characterizations for tax purposes of such common stock dividends for the years ended December 31:\n(1) Stock issuance costs consist primarily of underwriters' and agent's fees and commissions, and legal and\nThe lost revenues and increased property expenses resulting from vacant Properties or uncollectability of lease revenues could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and results of operations if NNN is unable to re-lease the Properties at comparable rental rates and in a timely manner. NNN currently expects a short-term decrease in cash from operations as its tenants are impacted by the pandemic and, while contractually obligated, some have not paid all rent amounts due (See \"Overview - Impact of COVID-19 on NNN's Business\").\n(1)Includes additional square footage from completed construction on existing Properties.\nDebt and Equity Securities\nNNN entered into forward starting swaps which were hedging the risk of changes in forecasted interest payments on the forecasted issuance of long-term debt. Upon the issuance of a series of unsecured notes, NNN terminated such derivatives as outlined in the following table (dollars in thousands):\nThe following table summarizes the diversification of the Property Portfolio by state as of December 31, 2020:\n\nReal Estate - Held For Sale. Real estate held for sale is not depreciated and is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, less costs to sell.\nRental Income. Rental income decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease is primarily due to the write-off of $21,793,000 of receivables due to reclassifying certain tenants as cash basis for accounting purposes and the lower probability of collecting rent from certain tenants due to the pandemic impact. The decrease in rental income for the year ended December 31, 2020 is partially offset by an increase in Rental Revenue due to Property acquisitions:\npremiums, note discounts and note costs. See \"Debt - Mortgages Payable\" and \"Debt - Notes Payable\".\n\nFinancing Strategy. NNN's financing objective is to manage its capital structure effectively in order to provide sufficient capital to execute its operating strategy while servicing its debt requirements, maintaining its investment grade credit rating, staggering debt maturities and providing value to NNN's stockholders. NNN generally utilizes debt and equity security offerings, bank borrowings, proceeds from the disposition of certain properties, and to a lesser extent, internally generated funds to meet its capital needs.\nNNN is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of its variable rate Credit Facility and its fixed rate debt which is used to finance NNN's development and acquisition activities, as well as for general corporate purposes. NNN's interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives, NNN borrows at both fixed and variable rates on its long-term debt. As of December 31, 2020, NNN had no outstanding derivatives.\nIn connection with the outstanding note offerings, NNN incurred debt issuance costs totaling $31,140,000 consisting primarily of underwriting discounts and commissions, legal and accounting fees, rating agency fees and printing expenses. Debt issuance costs for all note issuances have been deferred and are being amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest method.\nThe following summarizes NNN's revenues for each of the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands):\nThis section generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this annual report on Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 filed with the Commission on February 11, 2020.\nCapital Resources\n\nLine of Credit Payable. NNN's $900,000,000 Credit Facility had a weighted average outstanding balance of $18,895,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 2.6% during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Credit Facility matures January 2022, unless the Company exercises its option to extend maturity to January 2023. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature for NNN to increase the facility size up to $1,600,000,000, subject to lender approval. In May 2020, NNN amended its Credit Facility to include the addition of new terms and definitions, and to restate certain other definitions under the former unsecured revolving credit agreement, some of which modified the financial covenant calculations. As of December 31, 2020, there was no outstanding balance and $900,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility.\nHolders of NNN's preferred stock issuances are entitled to receive, when and as authorized by the Board of Directors, cumulative preferential cash distributions based on the stated rate and liquidation preference per annum. The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for NNN's preferred stock for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands, except per share data):\nThe following table details the rental revenue collected as of January 31, 2021, excluding the repayment of amounts previously deferred according to the rent deferral lease amendments for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 as a percentage of annualized base rent:\n(4)NNN is a lessee for three ground lease arrangements.\n(2)Includes NNN's notes payable, each exclude debt costs and are net of unamortized discounts. NNN uses market prices quoted from Bloomberg, a third party, which is a Level 1 input, to determine the fair value.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately six percent of total Properties, and approximately eight percent aggregate gross leasable area held in the Property Portfolio, were leased to 13 tenants that NNN has determined to recognize revenue on a cash basis. During the year ended December 31, 2020, NNN recognized $4,722,000 of rental income from certain tenants for periods following their classification to cash basis for accounting. NNN did not recognize any such revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nThe increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was partially offset by a decrease of $5,163,000 in the weighted average outstanding balance, and a 20 basis points decrease in the interest rate, on the Credit Facility for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The Credit Facility had a weighted average outstanding balance of $18,895,000 and $24,058,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, includes $2,291,000 in connection with the early redemption of the 2022 Notes described below.\nThe information in the table below summarizes NNN's market risks associated with its debt obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The table presents principal payments and related interest rates by year for debt obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2020. NNN has a variable interest rate risk on its Credit Facility which had no outstanding balance as of December 31, 2020 and $133,600,000 as of December 31, 2019. The weighted average rate for the Credit Facility for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 2.6%. The table incorporates only those debt obligations that existed as of December 31, 2020, and it does not consider those debt obligations or positions which could arise after this date and therefore has limited predictive value. As a result, NNN's ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, NNN's hedging strategies at that time and interest rates. If interest rates on NNN's variable rate debt increased by one percent, NNN's interest expense would have increased by less than one percent for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAnalysis of Expenses\n\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. The information in the following table summarizes NNN's contractual obligations and commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2020. The table presents principal cash flows by year-end of the expected maturity for debt obligations and commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2020.\nOn January 15, 2021, NNN declared a dividend of $0.520 per share, payable February 16, 2021, to its common stockholders of record as of January 29, 2021.\naccounting fees.\nOverview. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a novel strain of coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. Since that time, efforts taken in an attempt to contain the spread of COVID-19 have intensified. Several countries, including the United States, have taken steps to restrict travel, temporarily close businesses and issue quarantine orders, and it remains unclear how long such measures will remain in place.\nChanges in cash for investing activities are primarily attributable to acquisitions and dispositions of Properties. NNN typically uses cash on hand or proceeds from its Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of its Properties.\nNNN's leases typically contain provisions to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on NNN's results of operations. Tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of fixed increases, increases in the CPI, and/or, to a lesser extent, increases in the tenant's sales volume. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, rent increases will not keep up with the rate of inflation.\nand rent use the most relevant comparable properties for an acquisition. The final range relies upon ranking comparable properties' attributes from most similar to least similar.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nImpact of COVID-19 on NNN's Business\n\n\u2022$290,459,000 in net proceeds from the issuance in March of the 3.100% notes payable due in April 2050,\n(2)Includes dollars invested in projects under construction or tenant improvements for each respective year.\nIn addition to the contractual obligations outlined above, NNN has committed to fund construction on five Properties. The improvements on such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months. These construction commitments, at December 31, 2020, are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands):\nManagement anticipates satisfying these obligations with a combination of NNN's cash provided from operations, current capital resources on hand, its Credit Facility, debt or equity financings and asset dispositions.\nDebt\nComparison of Expenses - 2019 versus 2018\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased in amount for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The increase in depreciation and amortization expenses is primarily due to a partial year of depreciation from 63 Properties with aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 449,000 square feet acquired in 2020, and a full year of depreciation from 210 Properties with a gross leasable area of approximately 3,164,000 square feet acquired in 2019.\nAt-The-Market Offerings. Under NNN's shelf registration statement, NNN has established an ATM which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time. The following table outlines NNN's active ATM programs for the three years ended December 31, 2020:\n(1)The proceeds from the note issuance were used to pay down outstanding debt of NNN's Credit Facility, fund future property acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. Proceeds from the issuance of the 2028 Notes and the 2048 Notes were also used to redeem all of the $300,000 5.500% notes payable that were due 2021. Proceeds from the issuance of the 2030 Notes and the 2050 Notes were also used to redeem all of the $325,000 3.800% notes payable that were due in 2022.\nItem 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIn accordance with ASC 842, NNN reviews the collectability of its lease payments on an ongoing basis. NNN considers collectability indicators when analyzing accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends, all of which assists in evaluating the probability of outstanding and future lease payment collections. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and considerations are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition bankruptcy claims. At the point NNN deems the collection of lease payments not probable, previously recognized rental revenue is reversed and any related accrued rent and, subsequently, any lease revenue is only recognized when cash receipts are received. As a result of the review of lease payments collectability, NNN recorded a write-off of $21,792,000 of outstanding receivables and related accrued rent during the year ended December 31, 2020, and reclassified certain tenants as cash basis for accounting purposes.\n\u2022$395,062,000 in net proceeds from the issuance in March of the 2.500% notes payable due in April 2030,\nIn April 2020, the FASB issued interpretive guidance relating to the accounting for lease concessions provided as a result of COVID-19. In this guidance, entities can elect not to apply lease modification accounting with respect to such lease concessions and instead, treat the concession as if it was a part of the existing contract. This guidance is only applicable to COVID-19 related lease concessions that do not result in a substantial increase in the rights of the lessor or the obligations of the lessee. NNN elected to make this policy election for COVID-19 lease concessions, including the rent deferral lease amendments effective during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNNN has used, and expects to use in the future, issuances of debt and equity securities primarily to pay down its outstanding debt and to finance acquisitions. In August 2020, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Commission which was automatically effective and permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities.\n\u2022$5,092,000 from the issuance of 138,507 shares of common stock in connection with the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan ( DRIP\u201d).\nCash provided by operating activities represents cash received primarily from Rental Revenues and interest income less cash used for general and administrative expenses. NNN's cash flow from operating activities has been sufficient to pay the distributions for each period presented. The change in cash provided by operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, is primarily the result of changes in revenues and expenses as discussed in Results of Operations.\u201d Cash generated from operations is expected to fluctuate in the future.\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Property Portfolio remained at least 98 percent leased and had a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 11 years. High occupancy levels coupled with a net lease structure, provides enhanced probability of maintaining operating earnings.\n\nNNN does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes or currently have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges. NNN had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at December 31, 2020.\nGenerally, the Properties are leased under long-term triple net leases, which require the tenant to pay all property taxes and assessments, to maintain the interior and exterior of the Property, and to carry property and liability insurance coverage. Therefore, management anticipates that capital demands to meet obligations with respect to these Properties will be modest for the foreseeable future and can be met with funds from operations and working capital. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses associated with the Property. Management anticipates the costs associated with these Properties, NNN's vacant Properties or those Properties that become vacant will also be met with funds from operations and working capital. NNN may be required to borrow under its Credit Facility or use other sources of capital in the event of significant capital expenditures or major repairs.\n(2)Approximate square feet.\nThe following is a summary of NNN's total outstanding debt as of December 31 (dollars in thousands):\nRefer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 filed with the Commission on February 11, 2020, for a detailed comparison of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 versus December 31, 2018.\nIn October 2019, NNN redeemed all outstanding depositary shares (11,500,000) representing interests in its 5.700% Series E Preferred Stock. The Series E preferred stock was redeemed at $25.00 per depositary share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends through, but not including, the redemption date, for an aggregate redemption price of $25.079167 per depositary share. The excess carrying amount of preferred stock redeemed over the cash paid to redeem the preferred stock was $9,856,000 of issuance costs.\nNNN continues to maintain its diversification by tenant, geography and tenant's line of trade. NNN's largest lines of trade concentrations are the convenience store and restaurant (including full and limited service) sectors. These sectors represent a large part of the freestanding retail property marketplace and NNN's management believes these sectors present attractive investment opportunities. The Property Portfolio is geographically concentrated in the south and southeast United States, which are regions of historically above-average population growth. Given these concentrations, any financial hardship within these sectors or geographic regions could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operating performance of NNN.\n\n\nThe following presents the characterizations for tax purposes of such preferred stock dividends for the years ended December 31:\nIn accordance with the terms of the Credit Facility, NNN is required to meet certain restrictive financial covenants, which, among other things, require NNN to maintain certain (i) leverage ratios, (ii) debt service coverage, (iii) cash flow coverage, and (iv) investment limitations. At December 31, 2020, NNN was in compliance with those covenants. In the event that NNN violates any of these restrictive financial covenants, it could cause the debt under the Credit Facility to be accelerated and may impair NNN's access to the debt and equity markets and limit NNN's ability to pay dividends to its common and preferred stockholders, each of which would likely have a material adverse impact on NNN's financial condition and results of operations.\n\n(i)a partial year of Rental Revenue from 63 Properties with aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 449,000 square feet acquired in 2020, and\nNNN evaluates the creditworthiness of its current and prospective tenants. This evaluation may include reviewing available financial statements, store level financial performance, press releases, public credit ratings from major credit rating agencies, industry news publications and financial market data (debt and equity pricing). NNN may also evaluate the business and operations of its tenants, including past payment history and periodically meeting with senior management of certain tenants.\nFirm Commitment Underwritten Common Stock Issuances. In September 2019, NNN filed a prospectus supplement to the prospectus contained in its February 2018 shelf registration statement and issued 7,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $56.50 per share and received net proceeds of $379,410,000. In connection with this offering, NNN incurred stock issuance costs totaling approximately $16,090,000, consisting primarily of underwriters' fees and commissions, legal and accounting fees and printing expenses. NNN used the net proceeds from this offering to redeem the Series E preferred stock, repay outstanding debt under the Credit Facility, to fund property acquisitions, and for general corporate purposes.\nNNN's management team focuses on certain key indicators to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. The key indicators for NNN include items such as: the composition of the Property Portfolio (such as tenant, geographic and line of trade diversification), the occupancy rate of the Property Portfolio, certain financial performance ratios and profitability measures, industry trends and industry performance compared to that of NNN.\n\u2022$325,000,000 payment in March for the early

</tr>\n</table>", "summary": " Here is a summary of the key points from the MD&A report:\n\nOverview\n- National Retail Properties (NNN) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns and invests in properties leased to retail tenants under long-term net leases. \n- As of December 31, 2020, NNN owned 3,143 properties across 48 states that were 99% leased with a weighted average lease term of 10.7 years.\n\nImpact of COVID-19\n- The pandemic and related government restrictions have negatively impacted many of NNN's tenants, resulting in some tenants requesting lease adjustments and others not paying rent owed. This has increased uncertainty around lease payments and revenue recognition.\n- NNN has granted some rent deferrals and shifted some tenants to cash-basis revenue recognition. It wrote off $21.8 million in receivables and accrued rent in 2020 due to collectibility concerns.\n\nFinancial Highlights\n- Total revenues decreased 1.5% in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to write-offs and lower rent collection.\n- Net income decreased 10.8% in 2020 compared to 2019. \n- NNN has taken measures to conserve cash, including reducing investments in new properties. It had $267 million in cash at December 31, 2020.\n\nPortfolio\n- As of December 31, 2020, NNN's properties were concentrated in the southern and southeastern U.S., with convenience stores and restaurants representing the largest industry concentrations.  \n- Only 1% of properties were vacant at year-end.\n\nDebt\n- Total debt outstanding was $3.22 billion at December 31, 2020.\n- In March 2020, NNN redeemed $325 million of notes due in 2022 and issued $700 million in new long-term notes.\n\nDividends\n- Common dividends paid in 2020 totaled $356.4 million or $2.07 per share. Preferred dividends paid totaled $17.9 million."}
