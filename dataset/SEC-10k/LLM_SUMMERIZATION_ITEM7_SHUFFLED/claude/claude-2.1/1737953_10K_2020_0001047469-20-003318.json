Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors. We discuss factors that we believe could cause or contribute to these differences below and elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under Item 1A. \"Risk factors\" and under \"Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDiscussion and analysis of fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 specifically, as well as the year-over-year comparison of our financial performance for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 to March 31, 2019, are located in Part II, Item 7 - Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on June 28, 2019 as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto filed with the SEC on July 29, 2019, both of which are available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.\nOverview\nOncolytic immunotherapy, which we intend to establish as the second cornerstone of immune-based cancer treatment, is an emerging class of immuno-oncology therapy, alongside checkpoint blockade, that exploits the ability of certain viruses to selectively replicate in and directly kill tumors, as well as induce a potent, patient-specific, anti-tumor immune response. Such oncolytic, or \"cancer killing,\" viruses have the potential to generate an immune response targeted to an individual patient's particular set of tumor antigens, including neo-antigens that are uniquely present in tumors. Our product candidates incorporate multiple mechanisms of action into a practical \"off-the-shelf\" approach that is intended to maximize the immune response against a patient's cancer and to offer significant advantages over personalized vaccine approaches. We believe that the bundling of multiple approaches for the treatment of cancer into single therapies will simplify the development path of our product candidates, while also improving patient outcomes at a lower cost to the healthcare system than the use of multiple different drugs.\nThe foundation of our Immulytic platform consists of a proprietary, engineered strain of herpes simplex virus 1, or HSV-1, that has been \"armed\" with a fusogenic glycoprotein intended to substantially increase anti-tumor activity. Our Immulytic platform enables us to incorporate various genes into HSV-1 that are intended to further augment the inherent properties of HSV-1 in order to both directly destroy tumor cells and induce an anti-tumor immune response. We currently have three product candidates in our development pipeline, RP1, our lead product candidate, and additionally RP2 and RP3.\nWe are currently conducting a number of clinical trials of RP1, both as a monotherapy and in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy, with a focus on immune-responsive tumors. We are conducting a randomized, controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of RP1 in approximately 240 patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC, RP1's lead indication. This registration directed clinical trial is evaluating RP1 in combination with cemiplimab, an anti-PD-1 therapy developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Regeneron, versus cemiplimab alone. Regeneron has granted to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to cemiplimab for use in this trial, is funding one-half of the clinical trial costs and supplying cemiplimab at no cost to us. We have also opened for enrollment a Phase 1b clinical trial of single agent RP1 in solid organ transplant recipients with CSCC, which we believe to be potentially registrational (in its own right or, subject to discussion with regulatory authorities, following enrollment of additional patients). We have entered into a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS, under which it has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to, and is supplying at no cost, its anti-PD-1 therapy, nivolumab, for use in combination with RP1 in a multi-cohort clinical trial. We are currently enrolling a 125-patient extension cohort of RP1 combined with nivolumab in anti-PD-1 refractory cutaneous melanoma. We initiated this cohort after completing enrollment in a prior Phase 2 cohort in the same clinical trial of approximately 30 patients with melanoma. The data generated in the melanoma cohort demonstrated that RP1 combined with nivolumab has the potential to treat anti-PD-1 refractory melanoma. We also believe this cohort to be potentially registrational (in its own right or, subject to discussion with regulatory authorities, following enrollment of additional patients). We continue to enroll patients in other Phase 2 cohorts of approximately 30 patients each, testing RP1 in combination with nivolumab in non-melanoma skin cancers and microsatellite instability high, or MSI-H/dMMR tumors under of our collaboration with\nBMS. Due in part to COVID-19 related disruptions, we expect that the non-melanoma skin cancer cohort to be fully accrued by the end of 2020. Similarly, it is likely that accumulating sufficient data to inform a decision as to whether to pursue MSI-H/dMMR tumors into registration-directed development will be delayed into 2021.\nIn addition, as a result of the recently altered competitive landscape, we recently announced our intention to replace a 30-patient bladder cancer cohort with a cohort of patients with anti-PD-1 refractory non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC. We intend to file a protocol amendment with the applicable regulatory authorities in the near term in order to reflect this change.\nWe are also developing additional product candidates, RP2 and RP3, that have been further engineered to enhance anti-tumor immune responses and are intended to address additional tumor types. In addition to the expression of GALV-GP R(-) and human GM-CSF, RP2 has been engineered to express an antibody-like molecule intended to block the activity of CTLA-4, a protein that inhibits the immune response to tumors. RP3 has also been engineered with the intent to further stimulate an anti-tumor response through activation of the immune co-stimulatory pathways through expression of the ligands for CD40 and 4-1BB.\nWe initiated the Phase 1 clinical trial of RP2 in October 2019. The Phase 1 clinical trial of RP2 is being conducted as a collaboration with BMS, under which BMS has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to, and will supply at no cost, nivolumab, for use in combination with RP2. We expect to release initial data from this Phase 1 clinical trial in the second half of 2020. We intend to file an IND and/or foreign equivalents for RP3 and, assuming regulatory clearance, enter clinical development during 2020. IND and/or foreign equivalent enabling studies of RP3 are currently underway.\nRP1, RP2 and RP3 are administered by direct injection into solid tumors, guided either visually or by ultrasound or other imaging methods. We believe that direct injection maximizes virus-mediated tumor cell death, provides the most efficient delivery of virus-encoded immune activating proteins into the tumor with the goal of activating systemic immunity, and limits the systemic toxicities that could be associated with intravenous administration. Activation of systemic immunity through local administration is intended to lead to the induction of anti-tumor immune responses leading to clinical response of tumors that have not themselves been injected, which is known as an \"abscopal\" effect.\nWe began operations as Replimune Limited, an English limited company that was incorporated in 2015. On July 5, 2017, Replimune Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was incorporated and, on July 10, 2017, the shareholders of Replimune Limited effected a share-for-share exchange pursuant to which they exchanged their outstanding shares in Replimune Limited for shares in Replimune Group, Inc., on a one-for-one basis.\nIn addition, the holders of warrants to purchase shares of series seed preferred stock and stock options to acquire Replimune Limited capital stock canceled their warrants and stock options in Replimune Limited and were issued replacement warrants and stock options to acquire Replimune Group, Inc. capital stock on a one-for-one basis. We refer to these transactions collectively as the reorganization. Upon completion of the reorganization, the historical consolidated financial statements of Replimune Limited became the historical consolidated financial statements of Replimune Group, Inc. because the reorganization was accounted for similar to a reorganization of entities under common control due to the high degree of common ownership of Replimune Limited and Replimune Group, Inc. and lack of economic substance to the transaction. We concluded that the reorganization resulted in no change in the material rights and preferences of each respective class of equity interests and no change in the fair value of each respective class of equity interests before and after the reorganization. On December 8, 2017, Replimune Limited transferred all outstanding shares of its wholly owned subsidiary, Replimune, Inc., to Replimune Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation.\nReplimune Group, Inc. is the sole shareholder of Replimune Limited, Replimune, Inc. and Replimune Securities Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation that was incorporated in November 2017.\nFinancial overview\nSince our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing our Immulytic platform and our lead product candidate, RP1, building our intellectual property portfolio, conducting research and development of our product candidates, business planning, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for our operations. To date, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of equity securities and to a lesser extent the proceeds from the issuance of debt securities. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. On July 24, 2018, we completed our initial public offering, or IPO, of our common stock and issued and sold 6,700,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $15.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $93.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting offering costs. On July 30, 2018, we issued and sold an additional 707,936 shares of our common stock at the IPO price of $15.00 per share pursuant to the underwriters' partial exercise of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock, resulting in additional net proceeds of approximately $9.9 million after deducting discounts and commissions but before deducting other offering expenses. On August 8, 2019, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc., or the Hercules Loan Agreement, pursuant to which we borrowed $10.0 million under a secured term loan facility in the amount of $30.0 million, or the Term Loan Facility. On June 1, 2020 we entered into an amendment to the Hercules Loan Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, we increased the aggregate principal amount under the Term Loan Facility from $30.0 million to $40.0 million. Also on August 8, 2019, we entered into a Sales Agreement with SVB Leerink LLC, or the Sales Agreement, pursuant to which we may sell, from time to time, at our option, up to an aggregate amount of $75.0 million of shares of our common stock, of which we have sold $4.5 million as of March 31, 2020. On November 18, 2019, we completed a follow-on public stock offering, or the November Offering, of (i) 3,678,031 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $13.61 per share and (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase 2,200,000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $13.6099 per pre-funded warrant, the public offering price per share of common stock less the $0.0001 per share exercise price of each pre-funded warrant. On December 13, 2019 we sold 838,530 shares of our common stock to the underwriters at the public offering price in connection with the underwriters' partial exercise of their option to purchase additional shares of our common stock. We received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $85.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses of approximately $5.8 million.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Our net losses were $52.6 million and $30.8 million for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of March 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $112.3 million. These losses have resulted primarily from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years.\nWe anticipate that our expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the preclinical activities and clinical trials of our product candidates. In addition, we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. We expect that our expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially if and as we:\n\u2022 conduct our current and future clinical trials with RP1;\n\u2022 progress the clinical development of RP2 and preclinical development of RP3;\n\u2022 operate our own in-house manufacturing facility;\n\u2022 seek to identify and develop additional product candidates;\n\u2022 seek marketing approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any;\n\u2022 establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval;\n\u2022 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022 hire and retain additional clinical, quality control, scientific and general and administration personnel;\n\u2022 acquire or in-license other drugs and technologies; and\n\u2022 add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our research and development programs, any future commercialization efforts and operating as a public company.\nWe will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for RP1 or our other product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates and do not enter into a commercialization partnership in any jurisdiction, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our internal commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing, and distribution.\nAs a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back, or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.\nAs of March 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $168.6 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least 12 months from the issuance of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSee \"-Liquidity and capital resources\" and \"Risk factors-Risks related to our financial position and need for additional capital.\"\nComponents of our results of operations\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales as we do not have any approved products and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future. If our development efforts for RP1 or any other product candidates that we may develop in the future are successful and result in regulatory approval, or if we enter into collaboration or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from a combination of product sales or payments from those collaborations or license agreements.\nOperating expenses\nOur expenses since inception have consisted solely of research and development costs and general and administrative costs.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our discovery efforts and the development of our product candidates, and include:\n\u2022 expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including clinical research organizations, or CROs, that conduct research, preclinical activities and clinical trials on our behalf as well as contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, that manufacture our product candidates for use in our preclinical and clinical trials;\n\u2022 salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for personnel engaged in research and development functions;\n\u2022 costs of outside consultants, including their fees, stock-based compensation and related travel expenses;\n\u2022 the costs of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials;\n\u2022 costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements in connection with the development of our product candidates; and\n\u2022 facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.\nThese costs will be partially offset by our agreement with Regeneron related to our Phase 2 clinical trial of RP1 in approximately 240 patients with CSCC clinical trial.\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our service providers. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expenses.\nOur direct external research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist of costs, such as fees paid to consultants, contractors, CMOs, and CROs in connection with our preclinical and clinical development activities. To date, we have not allocated expenses to our earlier-stage programs for RP2 and RP3. In addition, we do not allocate employee costs, costs associated with our discovery efforts, laboratory supplies, and facilities, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific product development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product development programs and, as such, are not separately classified.\nThe table below summarizes our research and development expenses by product candidate or development program for each of the periods presented:\nTable 8: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended March 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2020 </th> <th> </th> <th>2019 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(Amounts in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> RP1\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>14,474 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>9,685 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated research and development expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel-related (including stock-based compensation)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,646 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,534 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,641 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,954 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>38,761 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>22,173 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue enrollment and initiate additional clinical trials of RP1, pursue initial stages of clinical development of RP2, complete preclinical development of RP3 and continue to discover and develop additional product candidates. The successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the following:\n\u2022 the scope, rate of progress, expense and results of our ongoing clinical trials , as well future clinical trials or other product candidates and other research and development activities that we may conduct;\n\u2022 the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue;\n\u2022 our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new ones;\n\u2022 uncertainties in clinical trial design and patient enrollment rates;\n\u2022 the successful completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability, and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority;\n\u2022 the receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022 our success in operating a manufacturing facility, or securing manufacturing supply through relationships with third parties;\n\u2022 our ability to obtain and maintain patents, trade secret protection, and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally;\n\u2022 our ability to protect our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022 the commercialization of our product candidates, if and when approved;\n\u2022 the acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, by patients, the medical community, and third-party payors;\n\u2022 our ability to successfully develop our product candidates for use in combination with third-party products or product candidates;\n\u2022 negative developments in the field of immuno-oncology;\n\u2022 competition with other products; and\n\u2022 significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance.\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant trial delays due to patient enrollment or other reasons, we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, finance, corporate and business development and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include professional fees for legal, patent, accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services; travel expenses; and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our general and administrative headcount to support our continued research and development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. We also expect to continue to incur increased expenses associated with being a public company, including costs of accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements; director and officer insurance costs; and investor and public relations costs.\nOther income (expense), net\nResearch and development incentives\nResearch and development incentives consists of reimbursements of research and development expenditures. We participate, through our subsidiary in the United Kingdom, in the research and development program provided by the United Kingdom tax relief program, such that a percentage of up to 14.5% of our qualifying research and development expenditures are reimbursed by the United Kingdom government, and such incentives are reflected as other income.\nChange in fair value of warrant liability\nIn connection with the issuance of the series seed preferred stock, we issued to the series seed preferred stockholders warrants to purchase shares of series seed preferred stock. Prior to the completion of our IPO, we classified the warrants as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. We remeasured the warrant liability to fair value at each reporting date and recognized changes in the fair value of the warrant liability as a component of other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations.\nEffective upon the completion of our IPO, the warrants to purchase shares of series seed preferred stock became exercisable for shares of common stock instead of shares of preferred stock, and the warrant liability was reclassified to additional paid-in capital. As a result, effective upon the completion of our IPO, we no longer recognize changes in the fair value of the warrant liability as other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations.\nInvestment income\nInvestment income consists of income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.\nInterest expense on finance lease liability\nInterest expense on finance lease liability consists of amortization of finance charges under our financing lease.\nInterest expense on debt obligations\nInterest expense on debt obligations consists of the amortization of debt discount and cash paid for interest under the Term Loan Facility.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses.\nIncome taxes\nSince our inception and through March 31, 2020, we have not recorded any income tax benefits for the net losses we incurred in each jurisdiction in which we operate, as we believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all of our net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act. The Tax Act includes a number of changes to existing tax law, including, among other things, a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, effective as of January 1, 2018, as well as limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of annual taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, in each case, for losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 (though any such net operating losses may be carried forward indefinitely). Under the Tax Act, our deferred tax assets and liabilities (before valuation allowance) were remeasured at the lower federal tax rate, resulting in an increase to our income tax provision with an equal and offsetting reduction in our valuation allowance. We completed our final determination of the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities for the year ended March 31, 2019 under SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 and we have not recorded any adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded at March 31, 2018.\nResults of operations\nComparison of the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 9: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

expenses for the year ended March 31, 2020 were $38.8 million, compared to $22.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. The increase of $16.6 million was due primarily to an increase of approximately $4.8 million in direct research costs associated with RP1 and an approximately $11.8 million increase in our unallocated research and development costs. The increase in RP1 costs was due primarily to an increase in clinical trial costs in the year ended March 31, 2020 associated with our ongoing clinical trials.\nThe increase in unallocated research and development expenses reflected an increase of $7.1 million in personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, and an increase of $4.7 million in other costs. The increase in personnel-related costs largely reflected the hiring of additional personnel in our research and development functions as we expanded the development plan for RP1 in multiple indications. Personnel related costs for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 included stock-based compensation expense of $3.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Other costs\nincreased primarily due to potential registrational studies associated with our RP1 development plan with multiple cohorts as well as costs associated with operations of our new manufacturing facility.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $17.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2020, compared to $8.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. The increase of $8.7 million primarily reflected increases of $4.7 million in personnel related costs, increases of $2.8 million in facility and other variable costs and increases of $1.1 million in professional fees. The increase in personnel related costs was due to the hiring of additional personnel in our general and administrative functions as we expanded our operations in the United States. The increase in professional fees was due to costs associated with increased spending to build out our information technology capabilities as well a legal and accounting fees related to ongoing business operations. The increase in facility and other variable costs was due primarily to an increase in costs associated with our directors and officers insurance.\nTotal other income, net\nOther income (expense) was $3.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2020, compared to $0.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. The increase of $3.5 million was primarily attributable to a $5.5 million charge related to the change in the fair value of the warrant liability in the 2019 fiscal year that did not recur in the 2020 fiscal year and a $0.6 million increase in research and development incentives due to the increase in qualifying research and development expenses. The increase in other income was partially offset by a $1.2 million increase in interest expense related to our finance lease liability as a result of the adoption of ASC 842 during the year ended March 31, 2020, a $0.7 million increase in interest expense on debt obligations related to our Term Loan Facility which was entered into during the year ended March 31, 2020, a $0.5 million decrease in other income due primarily to the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of Great British Pounds to United States Dollars and a $0.2 million decrease in investment income due to fluctuations in the rate of return on investments.\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, which causes the disease known as COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the U.S. and worldwide. We could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to an epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis, such as the recent outbreak of COVID-19. We are monitoring the global outbreak and spread of COVID-19 and have taken steps to identify and mitigate the adverse impacts on, and risks to, our business posed by its spread and actions taken by governmental and health authorities to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices, including implementing a global work from home policy for certain employees who are able to perform their duties remotely and restricting all nonessential travel, and we expect to continue to take actions as may be required or recommended by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, the patients we serve and other business partners in light of COVID-19. We currently expect the COVID-19 pandemic to delay the timing of patient enrollment and treatment in certain of our ongoing clinical studies. However, the extent of such delays, if any, is currently unknown and has and will likely continue to vary by clinical study site. In addition, we may incur unforeseen costs as a result of disruptions in clinical supply or preclinical study or clinical trial delays. The impact of COVID-19 on our business future results will largely depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions, the ultimate impact on financial markets and the\nglobal economy, and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease. See \"Risk Factors-Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the recent novel coronavirus disease-2019, or COVID-19, outbreak.\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nSince our inception, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We have not yet commercialized any of our product candidates, which are in various phases of preclinical and clinical development, and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any products for the foreseeable future, if at all.\nSources of liquidity\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of equity securities and, to a lesser extent, proceeds from the issuance of debt securities. Through March 31, 2020, we had received gross proceeds of approximately $304.0 million from our sales of common stock and preferred stock and $10.0 million from the issuance of debt. As of March 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $168.6 million.\nOn July 24, 2018, we completed our IPO and issued and sold 6,700,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $15.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $93.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting offering costs. On July 30, 2018, we issued and sold an additional 707,936 shares of our common stock at the IPO price of $15.00 per share pursuant to the underwriters' partial exercise of their option to purchase additional shares of our common stock, resulting in additional net proceeds of $9.9 million after deducting discounts and commissions but before deducting other offering expenses. On August 8, 2019 and as amended on June 1, 2020, we entered into the Hercules Loan Agreement, pursuant to which we borrowed $10.0 million under the secured Term Loan Facility in the amount of $30.0 million. On August 8, 2019, we entered into the Sales Agreement with SVB Leerink LLC, pursuant to which we may sell, from time to time, at our option, up to an aggregate amount of $75.0 million of shares of our common stock, of which we sold $4.5 million as of March 31, 2020. On November 18, 2019, we closed the November Offering of (i) 3,678,031 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $13.61 per share and (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase 2,200,000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $13.6099 per pre-funded warrant, the public offering price per share of the common stock less the $0.0001 per share exercise price of each pre-funded warrant. On December 13, 2019, we sold 838,530 shares of our common stock at the public offering price in connection with the underwriters' partial exercise of option to purchase additional shares of our common stock. We received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $85.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses of approximately $5.8 million.\nCash flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for each of the periods presented:\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended March 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2020 </th> <th> </th> <th>2019 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(60,552 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(25,378 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,233 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(65,944 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100,166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101,390 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(135 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(839 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>34,246 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>9,229 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating activities\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities was $60.6 million, primarily resulting from our net loss of $52.6 million and net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $15.4 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $7.5 million. Net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended March 31, 2020 consisted primarily of a $14.4 million net increase related to the adoption of ASC 842 (including changes in long-term prepaid rent operating lease liabilities, operating lease, right-of-use asset and financing lease, right-of-use-asset), a $3.8 million decrease in accounts payable and a $0.6 million increase in research and development incentives receivable, partially from the United Kingdom government due to the timing and amount of our qualifying expenditures and partially offset by a $0.9 decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a $2.5 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses were primarily due to the timing of vendor invoicing and payments. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to the recognition of prepaid amounts paid to vendors.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2019, net cash used in operating activities was $25.4 million, primarily resulting from our net loss of $30.8 million and net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $1.3 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $6.7 million. Net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended March 31, 2019 consisted primarily of a $0.8 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $0.3 million increase in the research and development incentives receivable from the United Kingdom government due to the timing and amount of our qualifying expenditures and a $0.3 million decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by a $0.1 million increase in accounts payable. The increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to an increase in amounts paid to vendors. The changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses were primarily due to the timing of vendor invoicing and payments.\nInvesting activities\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2020, net cash used in investing activities was $5.2 million, consisting of $149.7 million in purchases of available for sale securities and $6.5 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by $151.0 million in proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2019, net cash used in investing activities was $65.9 million, consisting of $189.9 million in purchases of available for sale securities and $2.6 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by $126.6 million in proceeds from maturities of short-term investments.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $100.2 million, consisting of $57.5 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and $28.2 million in proceeds from issuance of pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock in connection with our follow-on public offering, $10.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, $4.4 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock through ATM sales and $0.6 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $0.4 million in payments of issuance costs and $0.1 million in principal payments of finance lease obligations.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $101.4 million, consisting primarily of net cash proceeds of $103.3 million from our issuance of common stock in connection with our IPO and $0.2 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $2.2 million of payments of issuance costs.\nHercules Loan Agreement\nOn August 8, 2019 we and certain of our affiliates entered into the Hercules Loan Agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc., or Hercules, pursuant to which, Hercules agreed to make available to us a secured term loan facility in the amount of up to $30 million in the form of term loans, subject to certain terms and conditions. We borrowed $10.0 million at closing under the Hercules Loan Agreement. On June 1, 2020 we entered into an amendment to the Hercules Loan Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, we increased the aggregate principal amount under the Term Loan Facility from $30.0 million to $40.0 million. Pursuant to the Hercules Loan Agreement, as amended, we may borrow the unused $30.0 million available under the Term Loan Facility in three separate advances. The second advance of up to $10.0 million may be borrowed at our option between October 1, 2020 and December 15, 2020, the third advance of up to $10.0 million may be borrowed at our option between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 and the fourth advance of up to $10.0 million may be borrowed, at our option and subject to the achievement of certain borrowing milestones, between July 1, 2021 and December 15, 2021.\nBorrowings under the Hercules Loan Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal the greater of either (i) the prime rate as reported in The Wall Street Journal plus 2.75%, or (ii) 8.75%. Under the Hercules Loan Agreement, we were required to make monthly interest-only payments through September 1, 2022, and are required to make equal monthly payments of principal, plus accrued interest, from October 1, 2022 through August 1, 2023. As of March 31, 2020, the outstanding principal amount under the Hercules Loan Agreement was $10.0 million. The term of the Hercules Loan Agreement is four years, ending August 1, 2023.\nWe may voluntarily prepay all, but not less than all, of the outstanding principal at any time prior to the maturity date, subject to a prepayment fee, which ranges from 1% to 3% of the outstanding principal. A final payment of 4.95% of the aggregate amount of any advances made under the Hercules Loan Agreement.\nThe Term Loan Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property, and subject to certain exceptions and exclusions. The Hercules Loan Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, incur debt, grant liens, make acquisitions, make loans, dissolving, and entering into leases and asset sales, but does not contain any financial covenants.\nFunding requirements\nOur plan of operation is to continue implementing our business strategy, continue research and development of RP1 and our other product candidates and continue to expand our research pipeline\nand our internal research and development capabilities. We expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the preclinical activities and clinical trials of our product candidates. In addition, we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. We expect that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:\n\u2022 conduct our current and future clinical trials of RP1;\n\u2022 progress the preclinical and clinical development of RP2 and RP3;\n\u2022 operate our own in-house manufacturing facility;\n\u2022 seek to identify and develop additional product candidates;\n\u2022 seek marketing approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any;\n\u2022 establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval;\n\u2022 until our planned manufacturing facility is fully validated , continued manufacturing by third parties of larger quantities of our product candidates for clinical development.\n\u2022 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022 acquire or in-license other drugs and technologies; and\n\u2022 add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our research and development programs, any future commercialization efforts and operations as a public company.\nAs of March 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $168.6 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments along with our debt commitments will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through 2022.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of RP1 and other product candidates and programs, and because the extent to which we may enter into collaborations with third parties for development of our product candidates is unknown, we are unable to estimate the timing and amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the research and development of our product candidates. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including those described in this section and above under \"-Operating expenses-Research and development expenses.\"\nDeveloping novel biopharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval for any product candidates or generate revenue from the sale of any products for which we may obtain marketing approval. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of therapies that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if ever. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funds to achieve our business objectives.\nAdequate additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. We do not currently have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of our equity or convertible debt securities, our shareholders' interest may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences and anti-dilution protections that could adversely affect the rights of our common stockholder. Additional debt or\npreferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring debt adversely impact our ability to conduct our business, and may require the issuance of warrants, which could potentially dilute your ownership interest.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technology, future revenue streams, research programs, or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce and/or terminate our product development programs or any future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nContractual obligations and commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2020 and the effects that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Payments due by period </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Total </th> <th> </th> <th>Less than 1 year </th> <th> </th> <th>1 to 3 years </th> <th> </th> <th>4 to 5 years </th> <th> </th> <th>More than\n5 years </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(Amounts in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Manufacturing commitments(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>3,569 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>3,569 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease commitments(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,284 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,223 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,567 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,476 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>66,119 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>6,853 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>6,223 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>6,567 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>46,476 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Amounts in the table reflect commitments for costs associated with our external CMO, which we engaged to manufacture clinical trial materials.\n(2)Amounts in the table reflect minimum payments due under (i) our two operating leases of laboratory and office space in Woburn, Massachusetts and Oxfordshire, United Kingdom, at a monthly commitment of $7 and $31, respectively, and (ii) our financing lease of approximately 63,000 square feet of office, manufacturing and laboratory space in Framingham, Massachusetts. Our lease in Oxfordshire expires in April 2026 and is terminable by us in April 2021. The lease in Woburn, Massachusetts was terminated by the Company in March 2020, prior to the expiration of the lease term. The lease term for our Framingham lease commenced in December 2018. The rent commencement commenced in August 2019. The initial lease term is ten years from the rent commencement date and includes two optional five-year extensions. Annual lease payments during the first year of the lease in Framingham are $2,373 with increases of 3.0% each year. In June 2019, we entered into an agreement to lease approximately 18,700 square feet of office space in Woburn, Massachusetts. Pursuant to the lease agreement, the lease term commenced in August 2019 and the rent commenced in September 2019. The initial lease term is ten years from the rent commencement date and includes an optional five-year extension. Annual lease payments during the first year are $488 with increases of approximately 1.6% each year.\nWe enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs, CMOs and other third parties for clinical trials and preclinical research studies and testing. Manufacturing and research commitments in the preceding table include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table are limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee.\nCollaborations\nBMS\nOn February 26, 2018, we entered into a Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS. Pursuant to the agreement, BMS is providing to us, at no cost, nivolumab, its anti-PD-1 therapy, for use in combination with RP1 in our ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial. Under the agreement, we will sponsor, fund and conduct the clinical trial in accordance with an agreed-upon protocol. BMS granted us a non-exclusive, non-transferrable, royalty-free license (with a right to sublicense) under its intellectual property to use nivolumab in the clinical trial and has agreed to supply nivolumab, at no cost to us, for use in the clinical trial. Both parties will own the study data produced in the clinical trial, other than study data related solely to nivolumab, which will belong solely to BMS, or study data related solely to RP1, which will belong solely to us. In January 2020, this agreement was expanded to cover an additional cohort of 125 patients with anti-PD-1 refractory melanoma.\nUnless earlier terminated, the agreement will remain in effect until (i) the completion of the clinical trial, (ii) all related clinical trial data have been delivered to both parties and (iii) the completion of any statistical analyses and bioanalyses contemplated by the clinical trial protocol or any analysis otherwise agreed upon by the parties. The agreement may be terminated by either party (i) in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party, (ii) in the event the other party is insolvent or in bankruptcy proceedings or (iii) for safety reasons. Upon termination, the licenses granted to us to use nivolumab in the clinical trial will terminate. The agreement contains representations, warranties, undertakings and indemnities customary for a transaction of this nature.\nOn April 12, 2019, we entered into a separate agreement with BMS on terms similar to the terms set forth in the agreement described above, pursuant to which BMS will provide, at no cost to us, nivolumab for use in our Phase 1 clinical trial of RP2 in combination with nivolumab.\nRegeneron\nOn May 29, 2018, we entered into a Master Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Regeneron. Pursuant to the agreement we agreed to undertake one or more clinical trials with Regeneron for the administration of our product candidates in combination with cemiplimab, an anti-PD-1 therapy developed by Regeneron, across multiple solid tumor types, the first of which is our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial testing RP1 in combination with cemiplimab versus cemiplimab alone in patients with CSCC. Each clinical trial will be conducted pursuant to an agreed study plan which, among other things, will identify the name of the sponsor and which party will manage the particular study, and include the protocol, the budget and a schedule of clinical obligations. The first study plan related to the Phase 2 clinical trial in CSCC has been agreed.\nPursuant to the terms of the agreement, each party granted the other party a non-exclusive license of their respective intellectual property and agreed to contribute the necessary resources needed to fulfill their respective obligations, in each case, under the terms of agreed study plans. Development costs of a particular clinical trial will be split equally. The agreement contains representations, warranties, undertakings and indemnities customary for a transaction of this nature. The agreement also contains certain covenants that restrict us from entering into a third-party arrangement with respect to the use of our product candidates in combination with an anti-PD-1 therapy and that restrict Regeneron from entering into a third-party arrangement with respect to the use of cemiplimab in combination with an HSV-1 virus, in each case, for the treatment of a tumor type that is the subject of a clinical trial to which the covenants apply. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in a future study plan, these covenants are only applicable to our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in CSCC, and expire upon the one-year anniversary of the commencement of the applicable study plan.\nThe agreement may be terminated by either party if (i) there is no active study plan for which a final study report has not been completed, (ii) the parties have not entered into a study plan for an additional clinical trial within a period of time after the delivery of the most recent final study report or (iii) in the event of a material breach.\nCritical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in greater detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nAccrued research and development expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advanced payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\n\u2022 CROs in connection with performing research activities and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf;\n\u2022 CMOs in connection with the production of preclinical and clinical trial materials;\n\u2022 investigative sites or other service providers in connection with clinical trials;\n\u2022 vendors in connection with preclinical and clinical development activities; and\n\u2022 vendors related to product manufacturing and development and distribution of preclinical and clinical supplies.\nWe base our expenses related to preclinical studies and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CMOs and CROs that supply, conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. Payments under some\nof these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or the amount of prepaid expenses accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.\nStock-based compensation\nWe measure stock-based awards granted to employees and directors based on their fair value on the date of the grant and recognize compensation expense for those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We have to date only issued stock-based awards with service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight-line method. The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires inputs based on certain subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected term of the option, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of the option, and our expected dividend yield. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. The fair value of each stock-based award is estimated on the date of grant based on the fair value of our common stock on that same date.\nPrior to the adoption of ASC 2018-07 on April 1, 2019, for stock-based awards granted to consultants and non-employees, we recognize compensation expense over the period during which services are rendered by such non-employees and consultants until completed. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to completion of the service, the fair value of these awards is remeasured using the then-current fair value of our common stock and updated assumption inputs in the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nAfter the adoption of ASC 2018-07, for stock-based awards granted to consultants and non-employees, we measure stock-based these awards based on their fair value on the date of the grant and recognizes compensation expense for those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We have to date only issued stock-based awards with service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight-line method. The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires inputs based on certain subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected term of the option, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of the option, and our expected dividend yield.\nWe classify stock-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations in the same manner in which the award recipient's payroll costs are classified or in which the award recipient's service payments are classified.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements\nA description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEmerging growth company status\nAs an \"emerging growth company,\" the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 permits us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to \"opt out\" of this provision and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards when they are required to be adopted by public companies that are not emerging growth companies.", "item_7_truncated": "and our internal research and development capabilities. We expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the preclinical activities and clinical trials of our product candidates.

This registration directed clinical trial is evaluating RP1 in combination with cemiplimab, an anti-PD-1 therapy developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Regeneron, versus cemiplimab alone. Regeneron has granted to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to cemiplimab for use in this trial, is funding one-half of the clinical trial costs and supplying cemiplimab at no cost to us. We have also opened for enrollment a Phase 1b clinical trial of single agent RP1 in solid organ transplant recipients with CSCC, which we believe to be potentially registrational (in its own right or, subject to discussion with regulatory authorities, following enrollment of additional patients). We have entered into a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS, under which it has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to, and is supplying at no cost, its anti-PD-1 therapy, nivolumab, for use in combination with RP1 in a multi-cohort clinical trial. We are currently enrolling a 125-patient extension cohort of RP1 combined with nivolumab in anti-PD-1 refractory cutaneous melanoma. We initiated this cohort after completing enrollment in a prior Phase 2 cohort in the same clinical trial of approximately 30 patients with melanoma. The data generated in the melanoma cohort demonstrated that RP1 combined with nivolumab has the potential to treat anti-PD-1 refractory melanoma. We also believe this cohort to be potentially registrational (in its own right or, subject to discussion with regulatory authorities, following enrollment of additional patients). We continue to enroll patients in other Phase 2 cohorts of approximately 30 patients each, testing RP1 in combination with nivolumab in non-melanoma skin cancers and microsatellite instability high, or MSI-H/dMMR tumors under of our collaboration with\nLiquidity and capital resources\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2019, net cash used in operating activities was $25.4 million, primarily resulting from our net loss of $30.8 million and net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $1.3 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $6.7 million. Net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended March 31, 2019 consisted primarily of a $0.8 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $0.3 million increase in the research and development incentives receivable from the United Kingdom government due to the timing and amount of our qualifying expenditures and a $0.3 million decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by a $0.1 million increase in accounts payable. The increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to an increase in amounts paid to vendors. The changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses were primarily due to the timing of vendor invoicing and payments.\nComponents of our results of operations\nSee \"-Liquidity and capital resources\" and \"Risk factors-Risks related to our financial position and need for additional capital.\"\nResearch and development expenses for the year ended March 31, 2020 were $38.8 million, compared to $22.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. The increase of $16.6 million was due primarily to an increase of approximately $4.8 million in direct research costs associated with RP1 and an approximately $11.8 million increase in our unallocated research and development costs. The increase in RP1 costs was due primarily to an increase in clinical trial costs in the year ended March 31, 2020 associated with our ongoing clinical trials.\nIn addition, as a result of the recently altered competitive landscape, we recently announced our intention to replace a 30-patient bladder cancer cohort with a cohort of patients with anti-PD-1 refractory non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC. We intend to file a protocol amendment with the applicable regulatory authorities in the near term in order to reflect this change.\n\u2022 negative developments in the field of immuno-oncology;\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nIn connection with the issuance of the series seed preferred stock, we issued to the series seed preferred stockholders warrants to purchase shares of series seed preferred stock. Prior to the completion of our IPO, we classified the warrants as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. We remeasured the warrant liability to fair value at each reporting date and recognized changes in the fair value of the warrant liability as a component of other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations.\nOperating activities\n\u2022 facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.\nof these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or the amount of prepaid expenses accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.\n\nSince our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing our Immulytic platform and our lead product candidate, RP1, building our intellectual property portfolio, conducting research and development of our product candidates, business planning, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for our operations. To date, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of equity securities and to a lesser extent the proceeds from the issuance of debt securities. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. On July 24, 2018, we completed our initial public offering, or IPO, of our common stock and issued and sold 6,700,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $15.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $93.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting offering costs. On July 30, 2018, we issued and sold an additional 707,936 shares of our common stock at the IPO price of $15.00 per share pursuant to the underwriters' partial exercise of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock, resulting in additional net proceeds of approximately $9.9 million after deducting discounts and commissions but before deducting other offering expenses. On August 8, 2019, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc., or the Hercules Loan Agreement, pursuant to which we borrowed $10.0 million under a secured term loan facility in the amount of $30.0 million, or the Term Loan Facility. On June 1, 2020 we entered into an amendment to the Hercules Loan Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, we increased the aggregate principal amount under the Term Loan Facility from $30.0 million to $40.0 million. Also on August 8, 2019, we entered into a Sales Agreement with SVB Leerink LLC, or the Sales Agreement, pursuant to which we may sell, from time to time, at our option, up to an aggregate amount of $75.0 million of shares of our common stock, of which we have sold $4.5 million as of March 31, 2020. On November 18, 2019, we completed a follow-on public stock offering, or the November Offering, of (i) 3,678,031 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $13.61 per share and (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase 2,200,000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $13.6099 per pre-funded warrant, the public offering price per share of common stock less the $0.0001 per share exercise price of each pre-funded warrant. On December 13, 2019 we sold 838,530 shares of our common stock to the underwriters at the public offering price in connection with the underwriters' partial exercise of their option to purchase additional shares of our common stock. We received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $85.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses of approximately $5.8 million.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $101.4 million, consisting primarily of net cash proceeds of $103.3 million from our issuance of common stock in connection with our IPO and $0.2 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $2.2 million of payments of issuance costs.\n\u2022 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022 progress the preclinical and clinical development of RP2 and RP3;\nThese costs will be partially offset by our agreement with Regeneron related to our Phase 2 clinical trial of RP1 in approximately 240 patients with CSCC clinical trial.\nBorrowings under the Hercules Loan Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal the greater of either (i) the prime rate as reported in The Wall Street Journal plus 2.75%, or (ii) 8.75%. Under the Hercules Loan Agreement, we were required to make monthly interest-only payments through September 1, 2022, and are required to make equal monthly payments of principal, plus accrued interest, from October 1, 2022 through August 1, 2023. As of March 31, 2020, the outstanding principal amount under the Hercules Loan Agreement was $10.0 million. The term of the Hercules Loan Agreement is four years, ending August 1, 2023.\n\u2022 the commercialization of our product candidates, if and when approved;\nStock-based compensation\nOn February 26, 2018, we entered into a Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS. Pursuant to the agreement, BMS is providing to us, at no cost, nivolumab, its anti-PD-1 therapy, for use in combination with RP1 in our ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial. Under the agreement, we will sponsor, fund and conduct the clinical trial in accordance with an agreed-upon protocol. BMS granted us a non-exclusive, non-transferrable, royalty-free license (with a right to sublicense) under its intellectual property to use nivolumab in the clinical trial and has agreed to supply nivolumab, at no cost to us, for use in the clinical trial. Both parties will own the study data produced in the clinical trial, other than study data related solely to nivolumab, which will belong solely to BMS, or study data related solely to RP1, which will belong solely to us. In January 2020, this agreement was expanded to cover an additional cohort of 125 patients with anti-PD-1 refractory melanoma.\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements\n\u2022 our success in operating a manufacturing facility, or securing manufacturing supply through relationships with third parties;\n\n\u2022 CMOs in connection with the production of preclinical and clinical trial materials;\nWe classify stock-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations in the same manner in which the award recipient's payroll costs are classified or in which the award recipient's service payments are classified.\n\u2022 the receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\nInterest expense on finance lease liability consists of amortization of finance charges under our financing lease.\nSince our inception and through March 31, 2020, we have not recorded any income tax benefits for the net losses we incurred in each jurisdiction in which we operate, as we believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all of our net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized.\nChange in fair value of warrant liability\nWe began operations as Replimune Limited, an English limited company that was incorporated in 2015. On July 5, 2017, Replimune Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was incorporated and, on July 10, 2017, the shareholders of Replimune Limited effected a share-for-share exchange pursuant to which they exchanged their outstanding shares in Replimune Limited for shares in Replimune Group, Inc., on a one-for-one basis.\nThe foundation of our Immulytic platform consists of a proprietary, engineered strain of herpes simplex virus 1, or HSV-1, that has been \"armed\" with a fusogenic glycoprotein intended to substantially increase anti-tumor activity. Our Immulytic platform enables us to incorporate various genes into HSV-1 that are intended to further augment the inherent properties of HSV-1 in order to both directly destroy tumor cells and induce an anti-tumor immune response. We currently have three product candidates in our development pipeline, RP1, our lead product candidate, and additionally RP2 and RP3.\nRegeneron\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our general and administrative headcount to support our continued research and development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. We also expect to continue to incur increased expenses associated with being a public company, including costs of accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements; director and officer insurance costs; and investor and public relations costs.\nAs of March 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $168.6 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments along with our debt commitments will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through 2022.\nAfter the adoption of ASC 2018-07, for stock-based awards granted to consultants and non-employees, we measure stock-based these awards based on their fair value on the date of the grant and recognizes compensation expense for those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We have to date only issued stock-based awards with service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight-line method. The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires inputs based on certain subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected term of the option, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of the option, and our expected dividend yield.\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant trial delays due to patient enrollment or other reasons, we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technology, future revenue streams, research programs, or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce and/or terminate our product development programs or any future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advanced payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nIn addition, the holders of warrants to purchase shares of series seed preferred stock and stock options to acquire Replimune Limited capital stock canceled their warrants and stock options in Replimune Limited and were issued replacement warrants and stock options to acquire Replimune Group, Inc. capital stock on a one-for-one basis. We refer to these transactions collectively as the reorganization. Upon completion of the reorganization, the historical consolidated financial statements of Replimune Limited became the historical consolidated financial statements of Replimune Group, Inc. because the reorganization was accounted for similar to a reorganization of entities under common control due to the high degree of common ownership of Replimune Limited and Replimune Group, Inc. and lack of economic substance to the transaction. We concluded that the reorganization resulted in no change in the material rights and preferences of each respective class of equity interests and no change in the fair value of each respective class of equity interests before and after the reorganization. On December 8, 2017, Replimune Limited transferred all outstanding shares of its wholly owned subsidiary, Replimune, Inc., to Replimune Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation.\nAdequate additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. We do not currently have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of our equity or convertible debt securities, our shareholders' interest may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences and anti-dilution protections that could adversely affect the rights of our common stockholder. Additional debt or\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of RP1 and other product candidates and programs, and because the extent to which we may enter into collaborations with third parties for development of our product candidates is unknown, we are unable to estimate the timing and amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the research and development of our product candidates. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including those described in this section and above under \"-Operating expenses-Research and development expenses.\"\nOther income (expense), net\nOn July 24, 2018, we completed our IPO and issued and sold 6,700,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $15.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $93.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting offering costs. On July 30, 2018, we issued and sold an additional 707,936 shares of our common stock at the IPO price of $15.00 per share pursuant to the underwriters' partial exercise of their option to purchase additional shares of our common stock, resulting in additional net proceeds of $9.9 million after deducting discounts and commissions but before deducting other offering expenses. On August 8, 2019 and as amended on June 1, 2020, we entered into the Hercules Loan Agreement, pursuant to which we borrowed $10.0 million under the secured Term Loan Facility in the amount of $30.0 million. On August 8, 2019, we entered into the Sales Agreement with SVB Leerink LLC, pursuant to which we may sell, from time to time, at our option, up to an aggregate amount of $75.0 million of shares of our common stock, of which we sold $4.5 million as of March 31, 2020. On November 18, 2019, we closed the November Offering of (i) 3,678,031 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $13.61 per share and (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase 2,200,000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $13.6099 per pre-funded warrant, the public offering price per share of the common stock less the $0.0001 per share exercise price of each pre-funded warrant. On December 13, 2019, we sold 838,530 shares of our common stock at the public offering price in connection with the underwriters' partial exercise of option to purchase additional shares of our common stock. We received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $85.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses of approximately $5.8 million.\n\u2022 the successful completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability, and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority;\nCash flows\nFinancing Activities\n\u2022 the scope, rate of progress, expense and results of our ongoing clinical trials , as well future clinical trials or other product candidates and other research and development activities that we may conduct;\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $17.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2020, compared to $8.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. The increase of $8.7 million primarily reflected increases of $4.7 million in personnel related costs, increases of $2.8 million in facility and other variable costs and increases of $1.1 million in professional fees. The increase in personnel related costs was due to the hiring of additional personnel in our general and administrative functions as we expanded our operations in the United States. The increase in professional fees was due to costs associated with increased spending to build out our information technology capabilities as well a legal and accounting fees related to ongoing business operations. The increase in facility and other variable costs was due primarily to an increase in costs associated with our directors and officers insurance.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\n\u2022 vendors related to product manufacturing and development and distribution of preclinical and clinical supplies.\nInterest expense on debt obligations\nResearch and development expenses\nRevenue\nResults of operations\nWe will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for RP1 or our other product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates and do not enter into a commercialization partnership in any jurisdiction, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our internal commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing, and distribution.\nEmerging growth company status\n\u2022 vendors in connection with preclinical and clinical development activities; and\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of equity securities and, to a lesser extent, proceeds from the issuance of debt securities. Through March 31, 2020, we had received gross proceeds of approximately $304.0 million from our sales of common stock and preferred stock and $10.0 million from the issuance of debt. As of March 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $168.6 million.\nWe may voluntarily prepay all, but not less than all, of the outstanding principal at any time prior to the maturity date, subject to a prepayment fee, which ranges from 1% to 3% of the outstanding principal. A final payment of 4.95% of the aggregate amount of any advances made under the Hercules Loan Agreement.\nDeveloping novel biopharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval for any product candidates or generate revenue from the sale of any products for which we may obtain marketing approval. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of therapies that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if ever. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funds to achieve our business objectives.\nAs of March 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $168.6 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least 12 months from the issuance of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur plan of operation is to continue implementing our business strategy, continue research and development of RP1 and our other product candidates and continue to expand our research pipeline\nSources of liquidity\nInterest expense on debt obligations consists of the amortization of debt discount and cash paid for interest under the Term Loan Facility.\n\u2022 acquire or in-license other drugs and technologies; and\n\u2022 costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements in connection with the development of our product candidates; and\n\u2022 costs of outside consultants, including their fees, stock-based compensation and related travel expenses;\nThe Term Loan Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property, and subject to certain exceptions and exclusions. The Hercules Loan Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, incur debt, grant liens, make acquisitions, make loans, dissolving, and entering into leases and asset sales, but does not contain any financial covenants.\nUnless earlier terminated, the agreement will remain in effect until (i) the completion of the clinical trial, (ii) all related clinical trial data have been delivered to both parties and (iii) the completion of any statistical analyses and bioanalyses contemplated by the clinical trial protocol or any analysis otherwise agreed upon by the parties. The agreement may be terminated by either party (i) in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party, (ii) in the event the other party is insolvent or in bankruptcy proceedings or (iii) for safety reasons. Upon termination, the licenses granted to us to use nivolumab in the clinical trial will terminate. The agreement contains representations, warranties, undertakings and indemnities customary for a transaction of this nature.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, finance, corporate and business development and administrative functions.

We believe that direct injection maximizes virus-mediated tumor cell death, provides the most efficient delivery of virus-encoded immune activating proteins into the tumor with the goal of activating systemic immunity, and limits the systemic toxicities that could be associated with intravenous administration. Activation of systemic immunity through local administration is intended to lead to the induction of anti-tumor immune responses leading to clinical response of tumors that have not themselves been injected, which is known as an \"abscopal\" effect.\nInterest expense on finance lease liability\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, which causes the disease known as COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the U.S. and worldwide. We could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to an epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis, such as the recent outbreak of COVID-19. We are monitoring the global outbreak and spread of COVID-19 and have taken steps to identify and mitigate the adverse impacts on, and risks to, our business posed by its spread and actions taken by governmental and health authorities to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices, including implementing a global work from home policy for certain employees who are able to perform their duties remotely and restricting all nonessential travel, and we expect to continue to take actions as may be required or recommended by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, the patients we serve and other business partners in light of COVID-19. We currently expect the COVID-19 pandemic to delay the timing of patient enrollment and treatment in certain of our ongoing clinical studies. However, the extent of such delays, if any, is currently unknown and has and will likely continue to vary by clinical study site. In addition, we may incur unforeseen costs as a result of disruptions in clinical supply or preclinical study or clinical trial delays. The impact of COVID-19 on our business future results will largely depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions, the ultimate impact on financial markets and the\nOur direct external research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist of costs, such as fees paid to consultants, contractors, CMOs, and CROs in connection with our preclinical and clinical development activities. To date, we have not allocated expenses to our earlier-stage programs for RP2 and RP3. In addition, we do not allocate employee costs, costs associated with our discovery efforts, laboratory supplies, and facilities, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific product development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product development programs and, as such, are not separately classified.\n\u2022 expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including clinical research organizations, or CROs, that conduct research, preclinical activities and clinical trials on our behalf as well as contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, that manufacture our product candidates for use in our preclinical and clinical trials;\nOther income (expense) was $3.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2020, compared to $0.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. The increase of $3.5 million was primarily attributable to a $5.5 million charge related to the change in the fair value of the warrant liability in the 2019 fiscal year that did not recur in the 2020 fiscal year and a $0.6 million increase in research and development incentives due to the increase in qualifying research and development expenses. The increase in other income was partially offset by a $1.2 million increase in interest expense related to our finance lease liability as a result of the adoption of ASC 842 during the year ended March 31, 2020, a $0.7 million increase in interest expense on debt obligations related to our Term Loan Facility which was entered into during the year ended March 31, 2020, a $0.5 million decrease in other income due primarily to the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of Great British Pounds to United States Dollars and a $0.2 million decrease in investment income due to fluctuations in the rate of return on investments.\n\n\u2022 add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our research and development programs, any future commercialization efforts and operations as a public company.\nincreased primarily due to potential registrational studies associated with our RP1 development plan with multiple cohorts as well as costs associated with operations of our new manufacturing facility.\nThe increase in unallocated research and development expenses reflected an increase of $7.1 million in personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, and an increase of $4.7 million in other costs. The increase in personnel-related costs largely reflected the hiring of additional personnel in our research and development functions as we expanded the development plan for RP1 in multiple indications. Personnel related costs for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 included stock-based compensation expense of $3.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Other costs\nEffective upon the completion of our IPO, the warrants to purchase shares of series seed preferred stock became exercisable for shares of common stock instead of shares of preferred stock, and the warrant liability was reclassified to additional paid-in capital. As a result, effective upon the completion of our IPO, we no longer recognize changes in the fair value of the warrant liability as other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations.\nOverview\nTotal other income, net\n\u2022 hire and retain additional clinical, quality control, scientific and general and administration personnel;\nPrior to the adoption of ASC 2018-07 on April 1, 2019, for stock-based awards granted to consultants and non-employees, we recognize compensation expense over the period during which services are rendered by such non-employees and consultants until completed.

We have irrevocably elected to \"opt out\" of this provision and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards when they are required to be adopted by public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe initiated the Phase 1 clinical trial of RP2 in October 2019. The Phase 1 clinical trial of RP2 is being conducted as a collaboration with BMS, under which BMS has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to, and will supply at no cost, nivolumab, for use in combination with RP2. We expect to release initial data from this Phase 1 clinical trial in the second half of 2020. We intend to file an IND and/or foreign equivalents for RP3 and, assuming regulatory clearance, enter clinical development during 2020. IND and/or foreign equivalent enabling studies of RP3 are currently underway.\n\u2022 the acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, by patients, the medical community, and third-party payors;\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our service providers. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expenses.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $100.2 million, consisting of $57.5 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and $28.2 million in proceeds from issuance of pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock in connection with our follow-on public offering, $10.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, $4.4 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock through ATM sales and $0.6 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $0.4 million in payments of issuance costs and $0.1 million in principal payments of finance lease obligations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors. We discuss factors that we believe could cause or contribute to these differences below and elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under Item 1A. \"Risk factors\" and under \"Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\u2022 until our planned manufacturing facility is fully validated , continued manufacturing by third parties of larger quantities of our product candidates for clinical development.\n\u2022 seek marketing approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any;\n\u2022 conduct our current and future clinical trials of RP1;\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses.\nFunding requirements\nWe anticipate that our expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the preclinical activities and clinical trials of our product candidates. In addition, we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. We expect that our expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially if and as we:\nOncolytic immunotherapy, which we intend to establish as the second cornerstone of immune-based cancer treatment, is an emerging class of immuno-oncology therapy, alongside checkpoint blockade, that exploits the ability of certain viruses to selectively replicate in and directly kill tumors, as well as induce a potent, patient-specific, anti-tumor immune response. Such oncolytic, or \"cancer killing,\" viruses have the potential to generate an immune response targeted to an individual patient's particular set of tumor antigens, including neo-antigens that are uniquely present in tumors. Our product candidates incorporate multiple mechanisms of action into a practical \"off-the-shelf\" approach that is intended to maximize the immune response against a patient's cancer and to offer significant advantages over personalized vaccine approaches. We believe that the bundling of multiple approaches for the treatment of cancer into single therapies will simplify the development path of our product candidates, while also improving patient outcomes at a lower cost to the healthcare system than the use of multiple different drugs.\n\u2022 investigative sites or other service providers in connection with clinical trials;\n\u2022 seek to identify and develop additional product candidates;\nInvestment income\n\u2022 conduct our current and future clinical trials with RP1;\n\u2022 our ability to protect our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022 acquire or in-license other drugs and technologies; and\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nOn August 8, 2019 we and certain of our affiliates entered into the Hercules Loan Agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc., or Hercules, pursuant to which, Hercules agreed to make available to us a secured term loan facility in the amount of up to $30 million in the form of term loans, subject to certain terms and conditions. We borrowed $10.0 million at closing under the Hercules Loan Agreement. On June 1, 2020 we entered into an amendment to the Hercules Loan Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, we increased the aggregate principal amount under the Term Loan Facility from $30.0 million to $40.0 million. Pursuant to the Hercules Loan Agreement, as amended, we may borrow the unused $30.0 million available under the Term Loan Facility in three separate advances. The second advance of up to $10.0 million may be borrowed at our option between October 1, 2020 and December 15, 2020, the third advance of up to $10.0 million may be borrowed at our option between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 and the fourth advance of up to $10.0 million may be borrowed, at our option and subject to the achievement of certain borrowing milestones, between July 1, 2021 and December 15, 2021.\nReplimune Group, Inc. is the sole shareholder of Replimune Limited, Replimune, Inc. and Replimune Securities Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation that was incorporated in November 2017.\n\u2022 seek to identify and develop additional product candidates;\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nDiscussion and analysis of fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 specifically, as well as the year-over-year comparison of our financial performance for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 to March 31, 2019, are located in Part II, Item 7 - Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on June 28, 2019 as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto filed with the SEC on July 29, 2019, both of which are available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales as we do not have any approved products and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future. If our development efforts for RP1 or any other product candidates that we may develop in the future are successful and result in regulatory approval, or if we enter into collaboration or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from a combination of product sales or payments from those collaborations or license agreements.\nOn May 29, 2018, we entered into a Master Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Regeneron. Pursuant to the agreement we agreed to undertake one or more clinical trials with Regeneron for the administration of our product candidates in combination with cemiplimab, an anti-PD-1 therapy developed by Regeneron, across multiple solid tumor types, the first of which is our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial testing RP1 in combination with cemiplimab versus cemiplimab alone in patients with CSCC. Each clinical trial will be conducted pursuant to an agreed study plan which, among other things, will identify the name of the sponsor and which party will manage the particular study, and include the protocol, the budget and a schedule of clinical obligations. The first study plan related to the Phase 2 clinical trial in CSCC has been agreed.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue enrollment and initiate additional clinical trials of RP1, pursue initial stages of clinical development of RP2, complete preclinical development of RP3 and continue to discover and develop additional product candidates. The successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the following:\nItem 7. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\nSince our inception, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We have not yet commercialized any of our product candidates, which are in various phases of preclinical and clinical development, and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any products for the foreseeable future, if at all.\nInvestment income consists of income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.\nThe table below summarizes our research and development expenses by product candidate or development program for each of the periods presented:\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Our net losses were $52.6 million and $30.8 million for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of March 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $112.3 million. These losses have resulted primarily from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years.\n\u2022 progress the clinical development of RP2 and preclinical development of RP3;\nOn April 12, 2019, we entered into a separate agreement with BMS on terms similar to the terms set forth in the agreement described above, pursuant to which BMS will provide, at no cost to us, nivolumab for use in our Phase 1 clinical trial of RP2 in combination with nivolumab.\n\u2022 CROs in connection with performing research activities and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf;\n\u2022 our ability to obtain and maintain patents, trade secret protection, and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally;\nAccrued research and development expenses\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities was $60.6 million, primarily resulting from our net loss of $52.6 million and net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $15.4 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $7.5 million. Net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended March 31, 2020 consisted primarily of a $14.4 million net increase related to the adoption of ASC 842 (including changes in long-term prepaid rent operating lease liabilities, operating lease, right-of-use asset and financing lease, right-of-use-asset), a $3.8 million decrease in accounts payable and a $0.6 million increase in research and development incentives receivable, partially from the United Kingdom government due to the timing and amount of our qualifying expenditures and partially offset by a $0.9 decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a $2.5 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses were primarily due to the timing of vendor invoicing and payments. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to the recognition of prepaid amounts paid to vendors.\n\u2022 seek marketing approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any;\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in greater detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022 establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval;\nA description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act. The Tax Act includes a number of changes to existing tax law, including, among other things, a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, effective as of January 1, 2018, as well as limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of annual taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, in each case, for losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 (though any such net operating losses may be carried forward indefinitely). Under the Tax Act, our deferred tax assets and liabilities (before valuation allowance) were remeasured at the lower federal tax rate, resulting in an increase to our income tax provision with an equal and offsetting reduction in our valuation allowance. We completed our final determination of the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities for the year ended March 31, 2019 under SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 and we have not recorded any adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded at March 31, 2018.\nOur expenses since inception have consisted solely of research and development costs and general and administrative costs.\npreferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring debt adversely impact our ability to conduct our business, and may require the issuance of warrants, which could potentially dilute your ownership interest.\n\u2022 the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue;\nglobal economy, and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease.

In addition to the expression of GALV-GP R(-) and human GM-CSF, RP2 has been engineered to express an antibody-like molecule intended to block the activity of CTLA-4, a protein that inhibits the immune response to tumors. RP3 has also been engineered with the intent to further stimulate an anti-tumor response through activation of the immune co-stimulatory pathways through expression of the ligands for CD40 and 4-1BB.\n\u2022 significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2020, net cash used in investing activities was $5.2 million, consisting of $149.7 million in purchases of available for sale securities and $6.5 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by $151.0 million in proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments.\n\u2022 our ability to successfully develop our product candidates for use in combination with third-party products or product candidates;\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2020 and the effects that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\n\u2022 competition with other products; and\n\u2022 salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for personnel engaged in research and development functions;\nCritical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates\nPursuant to the terms of the agreement, each party granted the other party a non-exclusive license of their respective intellectual property and agreed to contribute the necessary resources needed to fulfill their respective obligations, in each case, under the terms of agreed study plans. Development costs of a particular clinical trial will be split equally. The agreement contains representations, warranties, undertakings and indemnities customary for a transaction of this nature. The agreement also contains certain covenants that restrict us from entering into a third-party arrangement with respect to the use of our product candidates in combination with an anti-PD-1 therapy and that restrict Regeneron from entering into a third-party arrangement with respect to the use of cemiplimab in combination with an HSV-1 virus, in each case, for the treatment of a tumor type that is the subject of a clinical trial to which the covenants apply. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in a future study plan, these covenants are only applicable to our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in CSCC, and expire upon the one-year anniversary of the commencement of the applicable study plan.\nBMS. Due in part to COVID-19 related disruptions, we expect that the non-melanoma skin cancer cohort to be fully accrued by the end of 2020.

We participate, through our subsidiary in the United Kingdom, in the research and development program provided by the United Kingdom tax relief program, such that a percentage of up to 14.5% of our qualifying research and development expenditures are reimbursed by the United Kingdom government, and such incentives are reflected as other income.\n\u2022 operate our own in-house manufacturing facility;\n(2)Amounts in the table reflect minimum payments due under (i) our two operating leases of laboratory and office space in Woburn, Massachusetts and Oxfordshire, United Kingdom, at a monthly commitment of $7 and $31, respectively, and (ii) our financing lease of approximately 63,000 square feet of office, manufacturing and laboratory space in Framingham, Massachusetts. Our lease in Oxfordshire expires in April 2026 and is terminable by us in April 2021. The lease in Woburn, Massachusetts was terminated by the Company in March 2020, prior to the expiration of the lease term. The lease term for our Framingham lease commenced in December 2018. The rent commencement commenced in August 2019. The initial lease term is ten years from the rent commencement date and includes two optional five-year extensions. Annual lease payments during the first year of the lease in Framingham are $2,373 with increases of 3.0% each year. In June 2019, we entered into an agreement to lease approximately 18,700 square feet of office space in Woburn, Massachusetts. Pursuant to the lease agreement, the lease term commenced in August 2019 and the rent commenced in September 2019. The initial lease term is ten years from the rent commencement date and includes an optional five-year extension. Annual lease payments during the first year are $488 with increases of approximately 1.6% each year.\nWe measure stock-based awards granted to employees and directors based on their fair value on the date of the grant and recognize compensation expense for those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We have to date only issued stock-based awards with service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight-line method. The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires inputs based on certain subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected term of the option, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of the option, and our expected dividend yield. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. The fair value of each stock-based award is estimated on the date of grant based on the fair value of our common stock on that same date.\nIncome taxes\nResearch and development incentives\nInvesting activities\nWe base our expenses related to preclinical studies and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CMOs and CROs that supply, conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf.

We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back, or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates.\nThe agreement may be terminated by either party if (i) there is no active study plan for which a final study report has not been completed, (ii) the parties have not entered into a study plan for an additional clinical trial within a period of time after the delivery of the most recent final study report or (iii) in the event of a material breach.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for each of the periods presented:\n\u2022 add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our research and development programs, any future commercialization efforts and operating as a public company.\nWe are currently conducting a number of clinical trials of RP1, both as a monotherapy and in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy, with a focus on immune-responsive tumors. We are conducting a randomized, controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of RP1 in approximately 240 patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC, RP1's lead indication. This registration directed clinical trial is evaluating RP1 in combination with cemiplimab, an anti-PD-1 therapy developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Regeneron, versus cemiplimab alone. Regeneron has granted to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to cemiplimab for use in this trial, is funding one-half of the clinical trial costs and supplying cemiplimab at no cost to us. We have also opened for enrollment a Phase 1b clinical trial of single agent RP1 in solid organ transplant recipients with CSCC, which we believe to be potentially registrational (in its own right or, subject to discussion with regulatory authorities, following enrollment of additional patients). We have entered into a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS, under which it has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to, and is supplying at no cost, its anti-PD-1 therapy, nivolumab, for use in combination with RP1 in a multi-cohort clinical trial. We are currently enrolling a 125-patient extension cohort of RP1 combined with nivolumab in anti-PD-1 refractory cutaneous melanoma. We initiated this cohort after completing enrollment in a prior Phase 2 cohort in the same clinical trial of approximately 30 patients with melanoma. The data generated in the melanoma cohort demonstrated that RP1 combined with nivolumab has the potential to treat anti-PD-1 refractory melanoma. We also believe this cohort to be potentially registrational (in its own right or, subject to discussion with regulatory authorities, following enrollment of additional patients). We continue to enroll patients in other Phase 2 cohorts of approximately 30 patients each, testing RP1 in combination with nivolumab in non-melanoma skin cancers and microsatellite instability high, or MSI-H/dMMR tumors under of our collaboration with\nLiquidity and capital resources\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2019, net cash used in operating activities was $25.4 million, primarily resulting from our net loss of $30.8 million and net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $1.3 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $6.7 million. Net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended March 31, 2019 consisted primarily of a $0.8 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $0.3 million increase in the research and development incentives receivable from the United Kingdom government due to the timing and amount of our qualifying expenditures and a $0.3 million decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by a $0.1 million increase in accounts payable. The increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to an increase in amounts paid to vendors. The changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses were primarily due to the timing of vendor invoicing and payments.\nComponents of our results of operations\nSee \"-Liquidity and capital resources\" and \"Risk factors-Risks related to our financial position and need for additional capital.\"\nResearch and development expenses for the year ended March 31, 2020 were $38.8 million, compared to $22.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. The increase of $16.6 million was due primarily to an increase of approximately $4.8 million in direct research costs associated with RP1 and an approximately $11.8 million increase in our unallocated research and development costs. The increase in RP1 costs was due primarily to an increase in clinical trial costs in the year ended March 31, 2020 associated with our ongoing clinical trials.\nIn addition, as a result of the recently altered competitive landscape, we recently announced our intention to replace a 30-patient bladder cancer cohort with a cohort of patients with anti-PD-1 refractory non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC. We intend to file a protocol amendment with the applicable regulatory authorities in the near term in order to reflect this change.\n\u2022 negative developments in the field of immuno-oncology;\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nIn connection with the issuance of the series seed preferred stock, we issued to the series seed preferred stockholders warrants to purchase shares of series seed preferred stock. Prior to the completion of our IPO, we classified the warrants as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. We remeasured the warrant liability to fair value at each reporting date and recognized changes in the fair value of the warrant liability as a component of other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations.\nOperating activities\n\u2022 facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.\nof these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or the amount of prepaid expenses accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.\n\nSince our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing our Immulytic platform and our lead product candidate, RP1, building our intellectual property portfolio, conducting research and development of our product candidates, business planning, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for our operations. To date, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of equity securities and to a lesser extent the proceeds from the issuance of debt securities. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. On July 24, 2018, we completed our initial public offering, or IPO, of our common stock and issued and sold 6,700,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $15.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $93.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting offering costs. On July 30, 2018, we issued and sold an additional 707,936 shares of our common stock at the IPO price of $15.00 per share pursuant to the underwriters' partial exercise of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock, resulting in additional net proceeds of approximately $9.9 million after deducting discounts and commissions but before deducting other offering expenses. On August 8, 2019, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc., or the Hercules Loan Agreement, pursuant to which we borrowed $10.0 million under a secured term loan facility in the amount of $30.0 million, or the Term Loan Facility. On June 1, 2020 we entered into an amendment to the Hercules Loan Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, we increased the aggregate principal amount under the Term Loan Facility from $30.0 million to $40.0 million. Also on August 8, 2019, we entered into a Sales Agreement with SVB Leerink LLC, or the Sales Agreement, pursuant to which we may sell, from time to time, at our option, up to an aggregate amount of $75.0 million of shares of our common stock, of which we have sold $4.5 million as of March 31, 2020. On November 18, 2019, we completed a follow-on public stock offering, or the November Offering, of (i) 3,678,031 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $13.61 per share and (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase 2,200,000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $13.6099 per pre-funded warrant, the public offering price per share of common stock less the $0.0001 per share exercise price of each pre-funded warrant. On December 13, 2019 we sold 838,530 shares of our common stock to the underwriters at the public offering price in connection with the underwriters' partial exercise of their option to purchase additional shares of our common stock. We received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $85.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses of approximately $5.8 million.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $101.4 million, consisting primarily of net cash proceeds of $103.3 million from our issuance of common stock in connection with our IPO and $0.2 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $2.2 million of payments of issuance costs.\n\u2022 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022 progress the preclinical and clinical development of RP2 and RP3;\nThese costs will be partially offset by our agreement with Regeneron related to our Phase 2 clinical trial of RP1 in approximately 240 patients with CSCC clinical trial.\nBorrowings under the Hercules Loan Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal the greater of either (i) the prime rate as reported in The Wall Street Journal plus 2.75%, or (ii) 8.75%. Under the Hercules Loan Agreement, we were required to make monthly interest-only payments through September 1, 2022, and are required to make equal monthly payments of principal, plus accrued interest, from October 1, 2022 through August 1, 2023. As of March 31, 2020, the outstanding principal amount under the Hercules Loan Agreement was $10.0 million. The term of the Hercules Loan Agreement is four years, ending August 1, 2023.\n\u2022 the commercialization of our product candidates, if and when approved;\nStock-based compensation\nOn February 26, 2018, we entered into a Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS. Pursuant to the agreement, BMS is providing to us, at no cost, nivolumab, its anti-PD-1 therapy, for use in combination with RP1 in our ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial. Under the agreement, we will sponsor, fund and conduct the clinical trial in accordance with an agreed-upon protocol. BMS granted us a non-exclusive, non-transferrable, royalty-free license (with a right to sublicense) under its intellectual property to use nivolumab in the clinical trial and has agreed to supply nivolumab, at no cost to us, for use in the clinical trial. Both parties will own the study data produced in the clinical trial, other than study data related solely to nivolumab, which will belong solely to BMS, or study data related solely to RP1, which will belong solely to us. In January 2020, this agreement was expanded to cover an additional cohort of 125 patients with anti-PD-1 refractory melanoma.\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements\n\u2022 our success in operating a manufacturing facility, or securing manufacturing supply through relationships with third parties;\n\n\u2022 CMOs in connection with the production of preclinical and clinical trial materials;\nWe classify stock-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations in the same manner in which the award recipient's payroll costs are classified or in which the award recipient's service payments are classified.\n\u2022 the receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\nInterest expense on finance lease liability consists of amortization of finance charges under our financing lease.\nSince our inception and through March 31, 2020, we have not recorded any income tax benefits for the net losses we incurred in each jurisdiction in which we operate, as we believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all of our net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized.\nChange in fair value of warrant liability\nWe began operations as Replimune Limited, an English limited company that was incorporated in 2015. On July 5, 2017, Replimune Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was incorporated and, on July 10, 2017, the shareholders of Replimune Limited effected a share-for-share exchange pursuant to which they exchanged their outstanding shares in Replimune Limited for shares in Replimune Group, Inc., on a one-for-one basis.\nThe foundation of our Immulytic platform consists of a proprietary, engineered strain of herpes simplex virus 1, or HSV-1, that has been \"armed\" with a fusogenic glycoprotein intended to substantially increase anti-tumor activity. Our Immulytic platform enables us to incorporate various genes into HSV-1 that are intended to further augment the inherent properties of HSV-1 in order to both directly destroy tumor cells and induce an anti-tumor immune response. We currently have three product candidates in our development pipeline, RP1, our lead product candidate, and additionally RP2 and RP3.\nRegeneron\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our general and administrative headcount to support our continued research and development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. We also expect to continue to incur increased expenses associated with being a public company, including costs of accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements; director and officer insurance costs; and investor and public relations costs.\nAs of March 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $168.6 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments along with our debt commitments will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through 2022.\nAfter the adoption of ASC 2018-07, for stock-based awards granted to consultants and non-employees, we measure stock-based these awards based on their fair value on the date of the grant and recognizes compensation expense for those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We have to date only issued stock-based awards with service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight-line method. The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires inputs based on certain subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected term of the option, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of the option, and our expected dividend yield.\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant trial delays due to patient enrollment or other reasons, we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technology, future revenue streams, research programs, or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce and/or terminate our product development programs or any future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advanced payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nIn addition, the holders of warrants to purchase shares of series seed preferred stock and stock options to acquire Replimune Limited capital stock canceled their warrants and stock options in Replimune Limited and were issued replacement warrants and stock options to acquire Replimune Group, Inc. capital stock on a one-for-one basis. We refer to these transactions collectively as the reorganization. Upon completion of the reorganization, the historical consolidated financial statements of Replimune Limited became the historical consolidated financial statements of Replimune Group, Inc. because the reorganization was accounted for similar to a reorganization of entities under common control due to the high degree of common ownership of Replimune Limited and Replimune Group, Inc. and lack of economic substance to the transaction. We concluded that the reorganization resulted in no change in the material rights and preferences of each respective class of equity interests and no change in the fair value of each respective class of equity interests before and after the reorganization. On December 8, 2017, Replimune Limited transferred all outstanding shares of its wholly owned subsidiary, Replimune, Inc., to Replimune Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation.\nAdequate additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. We do not currently have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of our equity or convertible debt securities, our shareholders' interest may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences and anti-dilution protections that could adversely affect the rights of our common stockholder. Additional debt or\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of RP1 and other product candidates and programs, and because the extent to which we may enter into collaborations with third parties for development of our product candidates is unknown, we are unable to estimate the timing and amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the research and development of our product candidates. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including those described in this section and above under \"-Operating expenses-Research and development expenses.\"\nOther income (expense), net\nOn July 24, 2018, we completed our IPO and issued and sold 6,700,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $15.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $93.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting offering costs. On July 30, 2018, we issued and sold an additional 707,936 shares of our common stock at the IPO price of $15.00 per share pursuant to the underwriters' partial exercise of their option to purchase additional shares of our common stock, resulting in additional net proceeds of $9.9 million after deducting discounts and commissions but before deducting other offering expenses. On August 8, 2019 and as amended on June 1, 2020, we entered into the Hercules Loan Agreement, pursuant to which we borrowed $10.0 million under the secured Term Loan Facility in the amount of $30.0 million. On August 8, 2019, we entered into the Sales Agreement with SVB Leerink LLC, pursuant to which we may sell, from time to time, at our option, up to an aggregate amount of $75.0 million of shares of our common stock, of which we sold $4.5 million as of March 31, 2020. On November 18, 2019, we closed the November Offering of (i) 3,678,031 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $13.61 per share and (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase 2,200,000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $13.6099 per pre-funded warrant, the public offering price per share of the common stock less the $0.0001 per share exercise price of each pre-funded warrant. On December 13, 2019, we sold 838,530 shares of our common stock at the public offering price in connection with the underwriters' partial exercise of option to purchase additional shares of our common stock. We received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $85.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses of approximately $5.8 million.\n\u2022 the successful completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability, and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority;\nCash flows\nFinancing Activities\n\u2022 the scope, rate of progress, expense and results of our ongoing clinical trials , as well future clinical trials or other product candidates and other research and development activities that we may conduct;\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $17.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2020, compared to $8.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. The increase of $8.7 million primarily reflected increases of $4.7 million in personnel related costs, increases of $2.8 million in facility and other variable costs and increases of $1.1 million in professional fees. The increase in personnel related costs was due to the hiring of additional personnel in our general and administrative functions as we expanded our operations in the United States. The increase in professional fees was due to costs associated with increased spending to build out our information technology capabilities as well a legal and accounting fees related to ongoing business operations. The increase in facility and other variable costs was due primarily to an increase in costs associated with our directors and officers insurance.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\n\u2022 vendors related to product manufacturing and development and distribution of preclinical and clinical supplies.\nInterest expense on debt obligations\nResearch and development expenses\nRevenue\nResults of operations\nWe will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for RP1 or our other product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates and do not enter into a commercialization partnership in any jurisdiction, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our internal commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing, and distribution.\nEmerging growth company status\n\u2022 vendors in connection with preclinical and clinical development activities; and\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of equity securities and, to a lesser extent, proceeds from the issuance of debt securities. Through March 31, 2020, we had received gross proceeds of approximately $304.0 million from our sales of common stock and preferred stock and $10.0 million from the issuance of debt. As of March 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $168.6 million.\nWe may voluntarily prepay all, but not less than all, of the outstanding principal at any time prior to the maturity date, subject to a prepayment fee, which ranges from 1% to 3% of the outstanding principal. A final payment of 4.95% of the aggregate amount of any advances made under the Hercules Loan Agreement.\nDeveloping novel biopharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval for any product candidates or generate revenue from the sale of any products for which we may obtain marketing approval. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of therapies that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if ever. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funds to achieve our business objectives.\nAs of March 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $168.6 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least 12 months from the issuance of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur plan of operation is to continue implementing our business strategy, continue research and development of RP1 and our other product candidates and continue to expand our research pipeline\nSources of liquidity\nInterest expense on debt obligations consists of the amortization of debt discount and cash paid for interest under the Term Loan Facility.\n\u2022 acquire or in-license other drugs and technologies; and\n\u2022 costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements in connection with the development of our product candidates; and\n\u2022 costs of outside consultants, including their fees, stock-based compensation and related travel expenses;\nThe Term Loan Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property, and subject to certain exceptions and exclusions. The Hercules Loan Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, incur debt, grant liens, make acquisitions, make loans, dissolving, and entering into leases and asset sales, but does not contain any financial covenants.\nUnless earlier terminated, the agreement will remain in effect until (i) the completion of the clinical trial, (ii) all related clinical trial data have been delivered to both parties and (iii) the completion of any statistical analyses and bioanalyses contemplated by the clinical trial protocol or any analysis otherwise agreed upon by the parties. The agreement may be terminated by either party (i) in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party, (ii) in the event the other party is insolvent or in bankruptcy proceedings or (iii) for safety reasons. Upon termination, the licenses granted to us to use nivolumab in the clinical trial will terminate. The agreement contains representations, warranties, undertakings and indemnities customary for a transaction of this nature.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, finance, corporate and business development and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include professional fees for legal, patent, accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services; travel expenses; and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.\n\u2022 establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval;\nRP1, RP2 and RP3 are administered by direct injection into solid tumors, guided either visually or by ultrasound or other imaging methods. We believe that direct injection maximizes virus-mediated tumor cell death, provides the most efficient delivery of virus-encoded immune activating proteins into the tumor with the goal of activating systemic immunity, and limits the systemic toxicities that could be associated with intravenous administration. Activation of systemic immunity through local administration is intended to lead to the induction of anti-tumor immune responses leading to clinical response of tumors that have not themselves been injected, which is known as an \"abscopal\" effect.\nInterest expense on finance lease liability\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, which causes the disease known as COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the U.S. and worldwide. We could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to an epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis, such as the recent outbreak of COVID-19. We are monitoring the global outbreak and spread of COVID-19 and have taken steps to identify and mitigate the adverse impacts on, and risks to, our business posed by its spread and actions taken by governmental and health authorities to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices, including implementing a global work from home policy for certain employees who are able to perform their duties remotely and restricting all nonessential travel, and we expect to continue to take actions as may be required or recommended by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, the patients we serve and other business partners in light of COVID-19. We currently expect the COVID-19 pandemic to delay the timing of patient enrollment and treatment in certain of our ongoing clinical studies. However, the extent of such delays, if any, is currently unknown and has and will likely continue to vary by clinical study site. In addition, we may incur unforeseen costs as a result of disruptions in clinical supply or preclinical study or clinical trial delays. The impact of COVID-19 on our business future results will largely depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions, the ultimate impact on financial markets and the\nOur direct external research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist of costs, such as fees paid to consultants, contractors, CMOs, and CROs in connection with our preclinical and clinical development activities. To date, we have not allocated expenses to our earlier-stage programs for RP2 and RP3. In addition, we do not allocate employee costs, costs associated with our discovery efforts, laboratory supplies, and facilities, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific product development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product development programs and, as such, are not separately classified.\n\u2022 expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including clinical research organizations, or CROs, that conduct research, preclinical activities and clinical trials on our behalf as well as contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, that manufacture our product candidates for use in our preclinical and clinical trials;\nOther income (expense) was $3.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2020, compared to $0.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. The increase of $3.5 million was primarily attributable to a $5.5 million charge related to the change in the fair value of the warrant liability in the 2019 fiscal year that did not recur in the 2020 fiscal year and a $0.6 million increase in research and development incentives due to the increase in qualifying research and development expenses. The increase in other income was partially offset by a $1.2 million increase in interest expense related to our finance lease liability as a result of the adoption of ASC 842 during the year ended March 31, 2020, a $0.7 million increase in interest expense on debt obligations related to our Term Loan Facility which was entered into during the year ended March 31, 2020, a $0.5 million decrease in other income due primarily to the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of Great British Pounds to United States Dollars and a $0.2 million decrease in investment income due to fluctuations in the rate of return on investments.\n\n\u2022 add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our research and development programs, any future commercialization efforts and operations as a public company.\nincreased primarily due to potential registrational studies associated with our RP1 development plan with multiple cohorts as well as costs associated with operations of our new manufacturing facility.\nThe increase in unallocated research and development expenses reflected an increase of $7.1 million in personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, and an increase of $4.7 million in other costs. The increase in personnel-related costs largely reflected the hiring of additional personnel in our research and development functions as we expanded the development plan for RP1 in multiple indications. Personnel related costs for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 included stock-based compensation expense of $3.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Other costs\nEffective upon the completion of our IPO, the warrants to purchase shares of series seed preferred stock became exercisable for shares of common stock instead of shares of preferred stock, and the warrant liability was reclassified to additional paid-in capital. As a result, effective upon the completion of our IPO, we no longer recognize changes in the fair value of the warrant liability as other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations.\nOverview\nTotal other income, net\n\u2022 hire and retain additional clinical, quality control, scientific and general and administration personnel;\nPrior to the adoption of ASC 2018-07 on April 1, 2019, for stock-based awards granted to consultants and non-employees, we recognize compensation expense over the period during which services are rendered by such non-employees and consultants until completed. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to completion of the service, the fair value of these awards is remeasured using the then-current fair value of our common stock and updated assumption inputs in the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\n(1)Amounts in the table reflect commitments for costs associated with our external CMO, which we engaged to manufacture clinical trial materials.\n\u2022 operate our own in-house manufacturing facility;\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019:\nAs an \"emerging growth company,\" the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 permits us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to \"opt out\" of this provision and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards when they are required to be adopted by public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe initiated the Phase 1 clinical trial of RP2 in October 2019. The Phase 1 clinical trial of RP2 is being conducted as a collaboration with BMS, under which BMS has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to, and will supply at no cost, nivolumab, for use in combination with RP2. We expect to release initial data from this Phase 1 clinical trial in the second half of 2020. We intend to file an IND and/or foreign equivalents for RP3 and, assuming regulatory clearance, enter clinical development during 2020. IND and/or foreign equivalent enabling studies of RP3 are currently underway.\n\u2022 the acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, by patients, the medical community, and third-party payors;\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred.

Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expenses.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $100.2 million, consisting of $57.5 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and $28.2 million in proceeds from issuance of pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock in connection with our follow-on public offering, $10.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, $4.4 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock through ATM sales and $0.6 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $0.4 million in payments of issuance costs and $0.1 million in principal payments of finance lease obligations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors.

Such oncolytic, or \"cancer killing,\" viruses have the potential to generate an immune response targeted to an individual patient's particular set of tumor antigens, including neo-antigens that are uniquely present in tumors. Our product candidates incorporate multiple mechanisms of action into a practical \"off-the-shelf\" approach that is intended to maximize the immune response against a patient's cancer and to offer significant advantages over personalized vaccine approaches. We believe that the bundling of multiple approaches for the treatment of cancer into single therapies will simplify the development path of our product candidates, while also improving patient outcomes at a lower cost to the healthcare system than the use of multiple different drugs.\n\u2022 investigative sites or other service providers in connection with clinical trials;\n\u2022 seek to identify and develop additional product candidates;\nInvestment income\n\u2022 conduct our current and future clinical trials with RP1;\n\u2022 our ability to protect our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022 acquire or in-license other drugs and technologies; and\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nOn August 8, 2019 we and certain of our affiliates entered into the Hercules Loan Agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc., or Hercules, pursuant to which, Hercules agreed to make available to us a secured term loan facility in the amount of up to $30 million in the form of term loans, subject to certain terms and conditions. We borrowed $10.0 million at closing under the Hercules Loan Agreement. On June 1, 2020 we entered into an amendment to the Hercules Loan Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, we increased the aggregate principal amount under the Term Loan Facility from $30.0 million to $40.0 million. Pursuant to the Hercules Loan Agreement, as amended, we may borrow the unused $30.0 million available under the Term Loan Facility in three separate advances. The second advance of up to $10.0 million may be borrowed at our option between October 1, 2020 and December 15, 2020, the third advance of up to $10.0 million may be borrowed at our option between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 and the fourth advance of up to $10.0 million may be borrowed, at our option and subject to the achievement of certain borrowing milestones, between July 1, 2021 and December 15, 2021.\nReplimune Group, Inc. is the sole shareholder of Replimune Limited, Replimune, Inc. and Replimune Securities Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation that was incorporated in November 2017.\n\u2022 seek to identify and develop additional product candidates;\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nDiscussion and analysis of fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 specifically, as well as the year-over-year comparison of our financial performance for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 to March 31, 2019, are located in Part II, Item 7 - Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on June 28, 2019 as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto filed with the SEC on July 29, 2019, both of which are available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales as we do not have any approved products and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future. If our development efforts for RP1 or any other product candidates that we may develop in the future are successful and result in regulatory approval, or if we enter into collaboration or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from a combination of product sales or payments from those collaborations or license agreements.\nOn May 29, 2018, we entered into a Master Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Regeneron. Pursuant to the agreement we agreed to undertake one or more clinical trials with Regeneron for the administration of our product candidates in combination with cemiplimab, an anti-PD-1 therapy developed by Regeneron, across multiple solid tumor types, the first of which is our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial testing RP1 in combination with cemiplimab versus cemiplimab alone in patients with CSCC. Each clinical trial will be conducted pursuant to an agreed study plan which, among other things, will identify the name of the sponsor and which party will manage the particular study, and include the protocol, the budget and a schedule of clinical obligations. The first study plan related to the Phase 2 clinical trial in CSCC has been agreed.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue enrollment and initiate additional clinical trials of RP1, pursue initial stages of clinical development of RP2, complete preclinical development of RP3 and continue to discover and develop additional product candidates. The successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the following:\nItem 7. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\nSince our inception, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We have not yet commercialized any of our product candidates, which are in various phases of preclinical and clinical development, and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any products for the foreseeable future, if at all.\nInvestment income consists of income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.\nThe table below summarizes our research and development expenses by product candidate or development program for each of the periods presented:\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Our net losses were $52.6 million and $30.8 million for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of March 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $112.3 million. These losses have resulted primarily from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years.\n\u2022 progress the clinical development of RP2 and preclinical development of RP3;\nOn April 12, 2019, we entered into a separate agreement with BMS on terms similar to the terms set forth in the agreement described above, pursuant to which BMS will provide, at no cost to us, nivolumab for use in our Phase 1 clinical trial of RP2 in combination with nivolumab.\n\u2022 CROs in connection with performing research activities and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf;\n\u2022 our ability to obtain and maintain patents, trade secret protection, and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally;\nAccrued research and development expenses\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities was $60.6 million, primarily resulting from our net loss of $52.6 million and net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $15.4 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $7.5 million. Net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended March 31, 2020 consisted primarily of a $14.4 million net increase related to the adoption of ASC 842 (including changes in long-term prepaid rent operating lease liabilities, operating lease, right-of-use asset and financing lease, right-of-use-asset), a $3.8 million decrease in accounts payable and a $0.6 million increase in research and development incentives receivable, partially from the United Kingdom government due to the timing and amount of our qualifying expenditures and partially offset by a $0.9 decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a $2.5 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses were primarily due to the timing of vendor invoicing and payments. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to the recognition of prepaid amounts paid to vendors.\n\u2022 seek marketing approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any;\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in greater detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022 establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval;\nA description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act. The Tax Act includes a number of changes to existing tax law, including, among other things, a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, effective as of January 1, 2018, as well as limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of annual taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, in each case, for losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 (though any such net operating losses may be carried forward indefinitely). Under the Tax Act, our deferred tax assets and liabilities (before valuation allowance) were remeasured at the lower federal tax rate, resulting in an increase to our income tax provision with an equal and offsetting reduction in our valuation allowance. We completed our final determination of the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities for the year ended March 31, 2019 under SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 and we have not recorded any adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded at March 31, 2018.\nOur expenses since inception have consisted solely of research and development costs and general and administrative costs.\npreferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring debt adversely impact our ability to conduct our business, and may require the issuance of warrants, which could potentially dilute your ownership interest.\n\u2022 the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue;\nglobal economy, and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease. See \"Risk Factors-Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the recent novel coronavirus disease-2019, or COVID-19, outbreak.\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\u2022 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022 uncertainties in clinical trial design and patient enrollment rates;\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our discovery efforts and the development of our product candidates, and include:\nContractual obligations and commitments\nWe enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs, CMOs and other third parties for clinical trials and preclinical research studies and testing. Manufacturing and research commitments in the preceding table include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table are limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee.\n\u2022 our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new ones;\nWe are also developing additional product candidates, RP2 and RP3, that have been further engineered to enhance anti-tumor immune responses and are intended to address additional tumor types. In addition to the expression of GALV-GP R(-) and human GM-CSF, RP2 has been engineered to express an antibody-like molecule intended to block the activity of CTLA-4, a protein that inhibits the immune response to tumors. RP3 has also been engineered with the intent to further stimulate an anti-tumor response through activation of the immune co-stimulatory pathways through expression of the ligands for CD40 and 4-1BB.\n\u2022 significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2020, net cash used in investing activities was $5.2 million, consisting of $149.7 million in purchases of available for sale securities and $6.5 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by $151.0 million in proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments.\n\u2022 our ability to successfully develop our product candidates for use in combination with third-party products or product candidates;\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2020 and the effects that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\n\u2022 competition with other products; and\n\u2022 salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for personnel engaged in research and development functions;\nCritical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates\nPursuant to the terms of the agreement, each party granted the other party a non-exclusive license of their respective intellectual property and agreed to contribute the necessary resources needed to fulfill their respective obligations, in each case, under the terms of agreed study plans. Development costs of a particular clinical trial will be split equally. The agreement contains representations, warranties, undertakings and indemnities customary for a transaction of this nature. The agreement also contains certain covenants that restrict us from entering into a third-party arrangement with respect to the use of our product candidates in combination with an anti-PD-1 therapy and that restrict Regeneron from entering into a third-party arrangement with respect to the use of cemiplimab in combination with an HSV-1 virus, in each case, for the treatment of a tumor type that is the subject of a clinical trial to which the covenants apply. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in a future study plan, these covenants are only applicable to our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in CSCC, and expire upon the one-year anniversary of the commencement of the applicable study plan.\nBMS. Due in part to COVID-19 related disruptions, we expect that the non-melanoma skin cancer cohort to be fully accrued by the end of 2020. Similarly, it is likely that accumulating sufficient data to inform a decision as to whether to pursue MSI-H/dMMR tumors into registration-directed development will be delayed into 2021.\nFinancial

biotech company developing oncolytic immunotherapy products to treat cancer. Its lead product candidate is RP1. It has not generated any revenue to date and has incurred significant operating losses, with a net loss of $52.6M in 2020 and an accumulated deficit of $112.3M as of March 31, 2020.\n\nResearch and Development Expenses\n- R&D expenses were $38.8M in 2020 compared to $22.2M in 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher costs for the RP1 clinical program and increased personnel and facility costs to support expansion of the development plan.\n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses \n- G&A expenses were $17.4M in 2020 compared to $8.8M in 2019. The increase reflected additional personnel costs, facility costs, and professional services fees to support expanded operations and public company compliance.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n- As of March 31, 2020, Replimune had $168.6M in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, which is expected to fund operations through 2022. Key financing activities included a public stock offering in November 2019 ($85.6M net proceeds) and debt financing ($10M).  \n\nExpected Increase in Expenses\n- Replimune expects operating expenses and capital expenditures to increase substantially in the future as it continues clinical development of RP1, pursues initial clinical trials for RP2, completes preclinical work for RP3, establishes in-house manufacturing capabilities, and expands its pipeline."}
