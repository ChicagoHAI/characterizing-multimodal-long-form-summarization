MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nKingsway is a Canadian holding company with operating subsidiaries located in the United States. The Company operates as a merchant bank primarily engaged, through its subsidiaries, in the property and casualty insurance business. Kingsway conducts its business through the following two reportable segments: Insurance Underwriting and Insurance Services.\nInsurance Underwriting includes the following subsidiaries of the Company: Mendota Insurance Company (\"Mendota\"), Mendakota Insurance Company (\"Mendakota\"), Mendakota Casualty Company (formerly Universal Casualty Company) (\"MCC\"), Kingsway Amigo Insurance Company (\"Amigo\") and Kingsway Reinsurance Corporation. Throughout this 2015 Annual Report, the term \"Insurance Underwriting\" is used to refer to this segment.\nInsurance Underwriting provides non-standard automobile insurance to individuals who do not meet the criteria for coverage by standard automobile insurers. Insurance Underwriting has policyholders in 12 states; however new business is accepted in only nine states. In 2015, production in the following states represented 84.8% of Insurance Underwriting's gross premiums written: Florida (24.0%), Texas (16.3%), Illinois (15.7%), California (10.3%), Nevada (9.9%) and Colorado (8.6%). For the year ended December 31, 2015, non-standard automobile insurance accounted for 100.0% of Insurance Underwriting's gross premiums written.\nThe Company previously placed Amigo and MCC into voluntary run-off in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Each of Amigo and MCC entered into a comprehensive run-off plan which was approved by its respective state of domicile. Kingsway continues to manage Amigo and MCC in a manner consistent with the run-off plans. During the first quarter of 2015, MCC sent a letter of intent to the Illinois Department of Insurance to resume writing private passenger automobile policies in the state of Illinois. MCC began writing these policies on April 1, 2015.\nInsurance Services includes the following subsidiaries of the Company: IWS Acquisition Corporation (\"IWS\") and Trinity Warranty Solutions LLC (\"Trinity\"). Throughout this 2015 Annual Report, the term \"Insurance Services\" is used to refer to this segment.\nIWS is a licensed motor vehicle service agreement company and is a provider of after-market vehicle protection services distributed by credit unions in 26 states to their members.\nTrinity is a provider of warranty products and maintenance support to consumers and businesses in the heating, ventilation, air conditioning (\"HVAC\"), standby generator, commercial LED lighting and refrigeration industries. Trinity distributes its warranty products through original equipment manufacturers, HVAC distributors and commercial and residential contractors. Trinity distributes its maintenance support direct through corporate owners of retail spaces throughout the United States.\nEffective April 1, 2015, the Company closed on the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary, Assigned Risk Solutions Ltd. (\"ARS\"). As a result, ARS has been classified as discontinued operations and the results of their operations are reported separately for all periods presented. Prior to the transaction, ARS was included in the Insurance Services segment. As a result of classifying ARS as a discontinued operation, all segmented information has been restated to exclude ARS from the Insurance Services segment.\nEffective March 31, 2014, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc. (\"PIH\"), formerly known as Maison Insurance Holdings, Inc., completed an initial public offering of its common stock. Upon completion of the transaction, the Company maintained a minority ownership interest in the common shares of PIH. The earnings of PIH are included in the consolidated statements of operations through the March 31, 2014 transaction date. Prior to the transaction, PIH was included in the Insurance Underwriting segment. As a result of the disposal of the Company's majority interest in PIH on March 31, 2014, all segmented information has been restated to exclude PIH from the Insurance Underwriting segment.\nNON U.S.-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThroughout this 2015 Annual Report, we present our operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful, useful and transparent to anyone using this financial information to evaluate our performance. In addition to the U.S. GAAP presentation of net income (loss), we show certain statutory reporting information and other non-U.S. GAAP financial measures that we believe are relevant in managing our business and drawing comparisons to our peers. These measures are segment operating (loss) income, gross premiums written, net premiums written and underwriting ratios.\nFollowing is a list of non-U.S. GAAP measures found throughout this report with their definitions, relationships to U.S. GAAP measures and explanations of their importance to our operations.\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSegment Operating (Loss) Income\nSegment operating (loss) income represents one measure of the pretax profitability of our segments and is derived by subtracting direct segment expenses from direct segment revenues. Revenues and expenses are presented in the consolidated statements of operations, but are not subtotaled by segment. However, this information is available in total and by segment in Note 22, \"Segmented Information,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, regarding reportable segment information. The nearest comparable U.S. GAAP measure is loss from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit) which, in addition to operating (loss) income, includes net investment income, net realized gains, other-than-temporary impairment loss, other income not allocated to segments, general and administrative expenses, amortization of intangible assets, contingent consideration benefit, impairment of asset held for sale, interest expense, foreign exchange losses, net, (gain) loss on change in fair value of debt, loss on disposal of subsidiary, loss on disposal of asset held for sale, loss on deconsolidation of subsidiary and equity in net loss of investee. A reconciliation of segment operating (loss) income to loss from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit) for the year ended December 31, 2015 is presented in Table 1 of the \"Results of Continuing Operations\" section of MD&A.\nGross Premiums Written\nWhile net premiums earned is the related U.S. GAAP measure used in the consolidated statements of operations, gross premiums written is the component of net premiums earned that measures insurance business produced before the impact of ceding reinsurance premiums, but without respect to when those premiums will be recognized as actual revenue. We use this measure as an overall gauge of gross business volume in Insurance Underwriting.\nNet Premiums Written\nWhile net premiums earned is the related U.S. GAAP measure used in the consolidated statements of operations, net premiums written is the component of net premiums earned that measures the difference between gross premiums written and the impact of ceding reinsurance premiums, but without respect to when those premiums will be recognized as actual revenue. We use this measure as an indication of retained or net business volume in Insurance Underwriting.\nUnderwriting Ratios\nKingsway, like many insurance companies, analyzes performance based on underwriting ratios such as loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, expense ratio and combined ratio. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is derived by dividing the amount of net loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred by net premiums earned. The expense ratio is derived by dividing the sum of commissions and premium taxes; general and administrative expenses and policy fee income by net premiums earned. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio and the expense ratio. A combined ratio below 100% demonstrates underwriting profit whereas a combined ratio over 100% demonstrates an underwriting loss.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates and their underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in estimates are recorded in the accounting period in which they are determined. The critical accounting estimates and assumptions in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses; valuation of fixed maturities and equity investments; valuation of deferred income taxes; impairment assessment of intangible assets; goodwill recoverability; deferred acquisition costs; fair value assumptions for performance shares; fair value assumptions for debt obligations; and contingent consideration.\nProvision for Unpaid Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nA significant degree of judgment is required to determine amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements for the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses. The process for establishing the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses reflects the uncertainties and significant judgmental factors inherent in predicting future results of both known and unknown loss events. As such, the process is inherently complex and imprecise and estimates are constantly refined. The process of establishing the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses relies on the judgment and opinions of a large number of individuals, including the opinions of the Company's actuaries. Further information regarding estimates used in determining our provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is discussed in the Unpaid Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses\u201d section of Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report and Note 12, \"Unpaid Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 32\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFactors affecting the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses include the continually evolving and changing regulatory and legal environment; actuarial studies; the professional experience and expertise of the Company's claims personnel and independent adjusters retained to handle individual claims; the quality of the data used for projection purposes; existing claims management practices including claims handling and settlement practices; the effect of inflationary trends on future loss settlement costs; court decisions; economic conditions; and public attitudes.\nThe Company utilizes external actuaries to evaluate the adequacy of our provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses under the terms of our insurance policies and vehicle service agreements. The provision is evaluated by the Company's actuaries with the results then shared with management, which is responsible for establishing the provision recorded in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIn the year-end actuarial review process, an analysis of the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is completed for each insurance subsidiary and IWS. Unpaid deferred cost containment expenses and unpaid adjusting and other expenses, which are components of the provision for loss adjustment expenses, and unpaid losses are each separately analyzed by line of business and by accident year utilizing a wide range of actuarial methods. These unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are further analyzed by looking separately at case reserves, which are specific reserves established for specific claims, and reserves for losses incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\").\nBecause the establishment of the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates, current provisions may need to be updated. Adjustments to the provision, both favorable and unfavorable, are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations for the periods in which such estimates are updated. The Company's actuaries develop a range of reasonable estimates and a point estimate of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses. The actuarial point estimate is intended to represent the actuaries' best estimate and will not necessarily be at the mid-point of the high and low estimates of the range.\nValuation of Fixed Maturities and Equity Investments\nOur equity investments, including warrants, are recorded at fair value using quoted market values based on latest bid prices, where active markets exist, or models based on significant market observable inputs, where no active markets exist. For fixed maturities, we use observable inputs such as quoted prices in inactive markets, quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments, benchmark interest rates, broker quotes and other relevant inputs. We do not have any investments in our portfolio which require us to use unobservable inputs. Any change in the estimated fair value of our investments could impact the amount of unrealized gain or loss we have recorded, which could change the amount we have recorded for our investments and other comprehensive income (loss) on our consolidated balance sheets.\nGains and losses realized on the disposition of investments are determined on the first-in first-out basis and credited or charged to the consolidated statements of operations. Premium and discount on investments are amortized and accredited using the interest method and charged or credited to net investment income.\nThe establishment of an other-than-temporary impairment on an investment requires a number of judgments and estimates. We perform a quarterly analysis of the individual investments to determine if declines in market value are other-than-temporary. The analysis includes some or all of the following procedures, as applicable:\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>identifying all unrealized loss positions that have existed for at least six months;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>identifying other circumstances which management believes may impact the recoverability of the unrealized loss positions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>obtaining a valuation analysis from third-party investment managers regarding the intrinsic value of these investments based on their knowledge and experience together with market-based valuation techniques;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>reviewing the trading range of certain investments over the preceding calendar period;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>assessing if declines in market value are other-than-temporary for debt instruments based on the investment grade credit ratings from third-party rating agencies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>assessing if declines in market value are other-than-temporary for any debt instrument with a non-investment grade credit rating based on the continuity of its debt service record;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>determining the necessary provision for declines in market value that are considered other-than-temporary based on the analyses performed; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>assessing the Company's ability and intent to hold these investments at least until the investment impairment is recovered.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The risks and uncertainties inherent in the assessment methodology used to determine declines in market value that are other-than-temporary include, but may not be limited to, the following:\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the opinions of professional investment managers could be incorrect;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 33\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the past trading patterns of individual investments may not reflect future valuation trends;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the credit ratings assigned by independent credit rating agencies may be incorrect due to unforeseen or unknown facts related to a company's financial situation; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the debt service pattern of non-investment grade instruments may not reflect future debt service capabilities and may not reflect a company's unknown underlying financial problems.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> As a result of the analysis performed by the Company to determine declines in market value that are other-than-temporary, the Company recorded a write down of $0.0 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to fixed maturities for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company did not recognize any impairment related to its investments that was considered other-than-temporary for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nValuation of Deferred Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes is calculated based on the expected tax treatment of transactions recorded in our consolidated financial statements. In determining our provision for income taxes, we interpret tax legislation in a variety of jurisdictions and make assumptions about the expected timing of the reversal of deferred income tax assets and liabilities and the valuation of deferred income taxes.\nThe ultimate realization of the deferred income tax asset balance is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the Company's temporary differences reverse and become deductible. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred income tax asset balance will not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is needed, management considers all available positive and negative evidence affecting specific deferred income tax asset balances, including the Company's past and anticipated future performance, the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, and the availability of tax planning strategies.\nObjective positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for all or a portion of a company's deferred income tax asset balances when significant negative evidence exists. Cumulative losses are the most compelling form of negative evidence considered by management in this determination. To the extent a valuation allowance is established in a period, an expense must be recorded within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2015, the Company maintains a valuation allowance of $283.6 million, $277.1 million of which relates to its U.S. deferred income taxes. The largest component of the U.S. deferred income tax asset balance relates to tax loss carryforwards that have arisen as a result of losses generated from the Company's U.S. operations. Uncertainty over the Company's ability to utilize these losses over the short-term has led the Company to record a valuation allowance.\nFuture events may result in the valuation allowance being adjusted, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. If sufficient positive evidence were to arise in the future indicating that all or a portion of the deferred income tax assets would meet the more likely than not standard, the valuation allowance would be reversed in the period that such a conclusion was reached.\nImpairment Assessment of Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Intangible assets with definite useful lives consist of vehicle service agreements in-force (\"VSA in-force\"), database and customer-related relationships. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If circumstances require that a definite-lived intangible asset be tested for possible impairment, we first compare the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that definite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the definite-lived intangible asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets consist of insurance licenses and trade name. Intangible assets with an indefinite life are assessed for impairment annually as of December 31, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the intangible asset is impaired, a fair value-based impairment test would be required. Management must make estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets that may affect any resulting impairment write-down. This includes assumptions regarding future cash flows and future revenues from the related intangible assets or their reporting units. Management then compares the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets to their respective carrying amounts. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds the fair value of that intangible asset, an impairment is recorded.\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 34\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdditional information regarding our intangible assets is included in Note 10, \"Intangible Assets,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill Recoverability\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment annually as of December 31, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the goodwill is impaired, a fair value-based impairment test would be required. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process that requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation. The first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on valuation techniques, including a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts, and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, which includes the allocated goodwill. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment, if any, by determining an implied fair value of goodwill. The determination of the implied fair value of goodwill of a reporting unit requires management to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. Any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill, which is compared to its corresponding carrying value. For reporting units with a negative book value, qualitative factors are evaluated to determine whether it is necessary to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test. Additional information regarding our goodwill is included in Note 9, \"Goodwill,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDeferred Acquisition Costs\nDeferred acquisition costs represent the deferral of expenses that we incur related to successful efforts to acquire new business or renew existing business. Acquisition costs, primarily commissions, premium taxes and underwriting and agency expenses related to issuing insurance policies and vehicle service agreements, are deferred and charged against income ratably over the terms of the related insurance policies and vehicle service agreements. Management regularly reviews the categories of acquisition costs that are deferred and assesses the recoverability of this asset. For Insurance Underwriting, a premium deficiency and a corresponding charge to income is recognized if the sum of the expected losses and loss adjustment expenses, unamortized acquisition costs and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums and anticipated net investment income.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nDerivative financial instruments include investments in warrants and performance shares issued to the Company under various performance share grant agreements. Refer to Note 24, \"Related Party Transactions,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further details regarding the performance shares. Warrants are classified as equity investments in the consolidated balance sheets.\nWe measure derivative financial instruments at fair value. Warrants are recorded at fair value using quoted market values based on latest bid prices, where active markets exist, or models based on significant market observable inputs, where no active markets exist. The performance shares, for which no active market exists, are required to be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Company. Such determination of fair value would require us to develop a model based upon relevant observable market inputs as well as significant unobservable inputs, including developing a sufficiently reliable estimate for an appropriate discount to reflect the illiquidity and unique structure of the security. The Company determined that its model for the performance shares was not sufficiently reliable. As a result, we have assigned a fair value of zero to the performance shares. The fair value of derivative financial instruments is required to be revalued each reporting period, with corresponding changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations, or, in the case of derivative financial instruments that are actively traded, in other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains or losses are recognized upon settlement of the contracts.\nFair Value Assumptions for Debt Obligations\nOur Linked Return of Capital (\"LROC\") preferred units due June 30, 2015 and subordinated debt are measured and reported at fair value. The fair value of the LROC preferred units was based on quoted market prices prior to redemption in June 2015, and the fair value of the subordinated debt is calculated by a third-party using a model based on significant market observable inputs. Any change in the estimated fair value of our debt is reflected in the gain or loss on change in fair value of debt we record in the consolidated statements of operations and in the carrying value for our debt on our consolidated balance sheets.\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 35\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContingent Consideration\nThe consideration for certain of the Company's acquisitions includes future payments to the former owners that are contingent upon the achievement of certain targets over future reporting periods. Liabilities for contingent consideration are measured and reported at fair value at the date of acquisition with subsequent changes reported in the consolidated statements of operations as contingent consideration benefit or expense. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is estimated using valuation models designed to estimate the probability of such contingent payments based on various assumptions. Estimated payments are discounted using present value techniques to arrive at the estimated fair value at the balance sheet date. We revalue these contingent consideration liabilities each reporting period. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or multiple inputs, including adjustments to the discount rates or changes in the assumed achievement or timing of any targets. These fair value measurements are based on significant inputs not observable in the market. Management must use judgment in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Changes in assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration benefit or expense reported in the consolidated statements of operations and an impact on the payout of contingent consideration liabilities. Additional information regarding our contingent consideration liabilities is included in Note 23, \"Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS\nA reconciliation of total segment operating (loss) income to net income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is presented in Table 1 below:\nTable 1 Segment Operating (Loss) Income\nFor the years ended December 31 (in thousands of dollars)\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating (loss) income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance Underwriting\n</td> <td>(1,147\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,437\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance Services\n</td> <td>(628\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(834\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment operating (loss) income\n</td> <td>(1,775\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,271\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>2,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gains\n</td> <td>1,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,844\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other-than-temporary impairment loss\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income and expenses not allocated to segments, net\n</td> <td>(3,753\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(4,887\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>(1,244\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1,620\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>376\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contingent consideration benefit\n</td> <td>1,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,084\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of asset held for sale\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,180\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(5,278\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(5,645\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>367\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange losses, net\n</td> <td>(1,215\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(419\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(796\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on change in fair value of debt\n</td> <td>1,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,953\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>12,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on disposal of subsidiary\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,244\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on disposal of asset held for sale\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(125\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>125\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on deconsolidation of subsidiary\n</td> <td>(4,420\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,420\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in net loss of investee\n</td> <td>(339\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(190\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(149\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>(11,322\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(15,887\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>4,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,221\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from continuing operations\n</td> <td>(11,415\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(14,666\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>3,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes\n</td> <td>1,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,025\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on disposal of discontinued operations, net of taxes\n</td> <td>11,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>1,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,224\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>12,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 36\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoss from Continuing Operations, Net Income (Loss) and Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred a loss from continuing operations of $11.4 million ($0.60 per diluted share) compared to $14.7 million ($0.95 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2014. The loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily attributable to operating loss in Insurance Underwriting and Insurance Services, income and expenses not allocated to segments, interest expense, and loss on deconsolidation of subsidiary, partially offset by net investment income and gain on change in fair value of debt. The loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 is attributable to income and expenses not allocated to segments, impairment of asset held for sale, interest expense, loss on change in fair value of debt and loss on disposal of subsidiary, partially offset by net realized gains, contingent consideration benefit and operating income in Insurance Services and Insurance Underwriting.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we reported net income of $1.3 million ($0.04 per diluted share) compared to net loss of $11.2 million ($0.75 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nInsurance Underwriting\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, Insurance Underwriting gross premiums written were $116.4 million compared to $114.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, representing a 2.1% increase. Net premiums written decreased 1.5% to $116.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with $118.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net premiums earned increased 3.4% to $117.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with $113.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in gross premiums written and net premiums earned results primarily from increased premium volumes written in Florida during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to prior year.\nThe Insurance Underwriting operating loss increased to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to operating income of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in operating loss is primarily attributed to an increase in loss and loss adjustment expenses, partially offset by an increase in net premiums earned and a decrease in general expenses in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nThe Insurance Underwriting loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for 2015 was 74.1% compared to 69.7% in 2014. The increase in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is primarily attributable to lower favorable development related to property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses at Amigo and MCC in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the continuing voluntary run-offs of Amigo and MCC.\nThe Insurance Underwriting expense ratio was 27.4% in 2015 compared with 29.5% in 2014. The decrease in the expense ratio is primarily due to an overall reduction in general expenses. The Insurance Underwriting expense ratio includes policy fee income of $8.3 million and $8.1 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nThe Insurance Underwriting combined ratio was 101.5% in 2015 compared with 99.2% in 2014, reflecting the dynamics which affected the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio and expense ratio.\nInsurance Services\nThe Insurance Services service fee and commission income decreased 6.9% to $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was due to decreased service fee and commission income at IWS. The Insurance Services operating loss was $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with operating income of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in operating loss is primarily related to decreased service fee and commission income at IWS and increased general and administrative expenses at Trinity for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income increased to $2.9 million in 2015 compared to $1.6 million in 2014. The increase in 2015 is due to an increase in income from limited liability investments. Income from limited liability investments is recognized based on the Company's share of the earnings of the limited liability entities.\nNet Realized Gains\nThe Company incurred net realized gains of $1.2 million in 2015 compared to $5.0 million in 2014. The net realized gains in 2015 resulted primarily from the liquidation of limited liability investments in Insurance Underwriting. The net realized gains in 2014 resulted primarily from the liquidation of equity investments in Insurance Underwriting.\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 37\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Income and Expenses not Allocated to Segments, Net\nOther income and expenses not allocated to segments was a net expense of $3.8 million in 2015 compared to $4.9 million in 2014. The decrease in net expense is primarily the result of a $6.0 million gain recorded during the first quarter of 2015 related to the termination of the Company's Management Services Agreement with PIH, as further discussed in Note 24, \"Related Party Transactions,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, partially offset by less general expense for salaries, employee benefits and professional fees in 2014 as compared to 2015, and $2.3 million of income reported during the first quarter of 2014 related to PIH. As further discussed in Note 4, \"Disposition, Deconsolidation and Discontinued Operations,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective March 31, 2014, PIH completed an initial public offering of its common stock. The earnings of PIH are included in the consolidated statements of operations through the March 31, 2014 transaction date. Prior to the transaction, PIH was included in the Insurance Underwriting segment. As a result of the disposal of the Company's majority interest in PIH on March 31, 2014, all segmented information has been restated to exclude PIH from the Insurance Underwriting segment and to include its earnings in other income and expenses not allocated to segments, net.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nThe Company's intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Amortization of intangible assets was $1.2 million in 2015 compared to $1.6 million in 2014. The decrease is primarily attributed to less amortization expense related to the IWS VSA in-force intangible asset in 2015 compared to 2014. The VSA in-force asset is amortized over a seven-year term as the corresponding deferred service fees acquired are earned as revenue.\nContingent Consideration Benefit\nContingent consideration benefit was $1.1 million in 2015 compared to $2.2 million in 2014. Contingent consideration liabilities resulting from the acquisitions of IWS and Trinity were estimated at their respective acquisition dates using valuation models designed to estimate the probability of such contingent payments based on various assumptions. The valuation models assume certain achievement of targets, discount rates related to riskiness of the projections used and the time value of money to calculate the net present value of future consideration payments. Each reporting period, the Company reevaluates its contingent consideration liabilities and, if significant, makes adjustments to the recorded liabilities. As a result of the analyses performed in 2015 and 2014, the Company decreased contingent consideration liabilities by $1.5 million and $3.0 million, respectively, during the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2014, resulting in a total liability of $2.0 million and $3.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015 and 2014, which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 23, \"Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further details.\nImpairment of Asset Held for Sale\nPrior to the fourth quarter of 2014, property consisting of building and land located in Miami, Florida with a carrying value of $5.2 million was classified as held for sale. As a result of declines in the fair value of the property, the Company recorded an impairment write-down of $1.2 million related to the asset held for sale during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for 2015 was $5.3 million compared to $5.6 million in 2014. The decrease is attributable to the repayment during June 2015 of the outstanding principal balance on the LROC preferred units due June 30, 2015.\nForeign Exchange Losses, Net\nDuring 2015, the Company incurred foreign exchange losses, net of $1.2 million compared to $0.4 million in 2014. Foreign exchange losses, net for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were incurred primarily related to conversion of the net Canadian dollar assets of Kingsway Linked Return of Capital Trust (\"KLROC Trust\").\nGain (Loss) on Change in Fair Value of Debt\nThe gain on change in fair value of debt amounted to $1.5 million in 2015 compared to a loss of $11.0 million in 2014. The 2015 gain is primarily due to a decrease in the fair values of the subordinated debt and LROC preferred units, whereas the 2014 loss is due to an increase in the fair value of the Company's subordinated debt, partially offset by a decrease in the fair value of the LROC preferred units. For information regarding the Company's approach to determining fair value of debt, see Note 23, \"Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 38\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoss on Disposal of Subsidiary\nEffective March 31, 2014, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, PIH, completed an initial public offering of its common stock. Upon completion of the transaction, the Company maintained a minority ownership interest in the common shares of PIH. As a result of the disposal, the Company recognized a loss of $1.2 million in 2014. See Note 4, \"Disposition, Deconsolidation and Discontinued Operations,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further details.\nLoss on Disposal of Asset Held for Sale\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company completed a sale and leaseback transaction involving building and land located in Miami, Florida, which was previously recorded as asset held for sale. Net proceeds were $4.3 million after deducting direct costs of the transaction. The Company recognized a loss of $0.1 million equal to the difference between the fair market value and the carrying value of the property at the date of the transaction. See Note 11, \"Property and Equipment,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further details.\nLoss on Deconsolidation of Subsidiary\nPrior to the second quarter of 2015, the Company beneficially owned and controlled 74.8% of KLROC Trust. As a result, the Company had been consolidating the financial statements of KLROC Trust. During the second quarter of 2015, the Company's controlling interest in KLROC Trust was reduced to zero upon the Company's repayment of its C$15.8 million outstanding on its LROC preferred units due June 30, 2015. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash loss on deconsolidation of subsidiary of $4.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. This reported loss results from removing the net assets and accumulated other comprehensive loss of KLROC Trust from the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The deconsolidation reduced consolidated shareholders' equity by $2.8 million at June 30, 2015. Refer to Note 4, \"Disposition, Deconsolidation and Discontinued Operations,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion.\nEquity in Net Loss of Investee\nEquity in net loss of investee of $0.3 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, represents the loss related to the Company's investment in 1347 Capital Corp. See Note 6, \"Investment in Investee,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nIncome tax expense for 2015 was $0.1 million compared to a tax benefit of $1.2 million in 2014. See Note 15, \"Income Taxes,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional detail of the income tax expense (benefit) recorded for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 39\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nINVESTMENTS\nPortfolio Composition\nAll of our investments in fixed maturities and equity investments are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value. At December 31, 2015, we held cash and cash equivalents and investments with a carrying value of $159.4 million. As of December 31, 2015, we held an investments portfolio comprised primarily of fixed maturities issued by the U.S. Government, government agencies and high quality corporate issuers. Investments held by our insurance subsidiaries must comply with applicable domiciliary state regulations that prescribe the type, quality and concentration of investments. Our U.S. operations typically invest in U.S. dollar-denominated instruments to mitigate their exposure to currency rate fluctuations.\nTable 2 below summarizes the carrying value of investments,

</tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2015, 82.9% of fixed maturities, including treasury bills, government bonds and corporate bonds, had contractual maturities of five years or less. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain issuers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. The Company holds cash and high-grade short-term assets which, along with fixed maturities, management believes are sufficient in amount for the payment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses and other operating subsidiary obligations on a timely basis. In the event that additional cash is required to meet obligations to our policyholders and customers, we believe that the high-quality, liquid investments in the portfolios provide us with sufficient liquidity.\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in interest or currency exchange rates and equity prices. Given our U.S. operations typically invest in U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturity instruments, our primary market risk exposures in the investments portfolio are to changes in interest rates.\nBecause the investments portfolio is comprised of primarily fixed maturity instruments that are usually held to maturity, periodic changes in interest rate levels generally impact our financial results to the extent that the investments are recorded at market value and reinvestment yields are different than the original yields on maturing instruments. During periods of rising interest rates, the market values of the existing fixed maturities will generally decrease. The reverse is true during periods of declining interest rates.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is defined as the risk of financial loss due to failure of the other party to a financial instrument to discharge an obligation. Credit risk arises from our positions in short-term investments, corporate debt instruments and government bonds.\nThe Investment and Capital Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for the oversight of key investment policies and limits. These policies and limits are subject to annual review and approval by the Investment and Capital Committee. The Investment and Capital Committee is also responsible for ensuring that these policies are implemented and that procedures are in place to manage and control credit risk.\nTable 4 below summarizes the composition of the fair values of fixed maturities, excluding cash and cash equivalents, at December 31, 2015 and 2014, by rating as assigned by Standard and Poor's (\"S&P\") or Moody's Investors Service (\"Moody's\"). Fixed maturities consist of predominantly high-quality instruments in corporate and government bonds with approximately 90.8% of those investments rated 'A' or better at December 31, 2015. During the first quarter of 2015, the Company received $3.0 million of 8% preferred stock of PIH, redeemable in five years, related to the termination of the Company's Management Services Agreement with PIH, as further discussed in Note 24, \"Related Party Transactions,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preferred stock is not rated.\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 41\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTABLE 4 Credit ratings of fixed maturities\nAs of December 31\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rating (S&P/Moody's)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AAA/Aaa\n</td> <td>61.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>65.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AA/Aa\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A/A\n</td> <td>18.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage rated A/A2 or better\n</td> <td>90.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>95.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BBB/Baa\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Not rated\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment\nThe Company performs a quarterly analysis of its investment portfolio to determine if declines in market value are other-than-temporary. Further information regarding our detailed analysis and factors considered in establishing an other-than-temporary impairment on an investment is discussed within the \"Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions\" section of MD&A.\nAs a result of the analysis performed by the Company to determine declines in market value that are other-than-temporary, the Company recorded a write down of $0.0 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to fixed maturities for the year ended December 31, 2015. There were no write-downs for other-than-temporary impairments related to investments for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe length of time a fixed maturity investment may be held in an unrealized loss position may vary based on the opinion of the investment manager and their respective analyses related to valuation and to the various credit risks that may prevent us from recapturing the principal investment. In the case of a fixed maturity investment where the investment manager determines that there is little or no risk of default prior to the maturity of a holding, we would elect to hold the investment in an unrealized loss position until the price recovers or the investment matures. In situations where facts emerge that might increase the risk associated with recapture of principal, the Company may elect to sell a fixed maturity investment at a loss.\nDue to the inherent volatility of equity markets, we believe an equity investment may trade from time to time below its intrinsic value based on historical valuation measures. In these situations, an equity investment may be maintained in an unrealized loss position for different periods of time based on the underlying economic assumptions driving the investment manager's valuation of the holding.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, the gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities and equity investments amounted to $2.6 million and $0.7 million, respectively, and there were no unrealized losses attributable to non-investment grade fixed maturities. At each of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, all unrealized losses on individual investments were considered temporary.\nLimited Liability Investments\nThe Company owns investments in various limited liability companies (\"LLCs\") and limited partnerships (\"LPs\") that primarily invest in income-producing real estate or real estate related investments. The Company's investments in the LLCs and LPs are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and reported as limited liability investments in the consolidated balance sheets. The real estate investments are held on a triple net lease basis whereby the lessee agrees to pay all real estate taxes, building insurance and maintenance. The real estate investments typically yield between 7.5% - 8% minimum preferred return on invested capital. Table 5 below presents additional information pertaining to the limited liability investments at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 42\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTABLE 5 Limited liability investments\nAs of December 31 (in thousands of dollars)\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Unfunded Commitment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Carrying Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Limited liability investments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate held through LP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments held through LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment in Investee\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company owns 61.0% of the outstanding units of 1347 Investors LLC (\"1347 Investors\"). Because the Company owns more than 50% of the outstanding units, 1347 Investors is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2015. 1347 Investors has an investment in the common stock and private units of 1347 Capital Corp. which is reflected as investment in investee in the consolidated balance sheets. 1347 Capital Corp. was formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities.\nOn July 21, 2014, 1347 Capital Corp. completed an initial public offering of 4.0 million units at a price to the public of $10.00 per unit for total gross proceeds of $40.0 million. Each unit issued in the initial public offering consists of one share of common stock, one right to receive one-tenth of a share of common stock automatically on the consummation of an initial business combination, and one warrant to acquire one-half of one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per full share of common stock. On July 23, 2014, the option to purchase an additional 0.6 million units that 1347 Capital Corp. had granted to the underwriters for additional gross proceeds of $6.0 million was completed. As a result, 1347 Capital Corp. issued a total of 4.6 million units in its initial public offering, generating total gross proceeds of $46.0 million.\n1347 Capital Corp. has 24 months from July 21, 2014, the date of the initial public offering, to complete a successful business combination. Had a successful business combination been consummated during 2015, and assuming the December 31, 2015 closing stock price for 1347 Capital Corp. common shares, the Company estimates the increase in its shareholders' equity would have been approximately $5.8 million at December 31, 2015. There can be no assurance that 1347 Capital Corp. will complete a successful business combination. In the event 1347 Capital Corp. does not complete a successful business combination, the Company estimates its shareholders' equity would decrease by approximately $1.8 million.\nPROPERTY AND CASUALTY UNPAID LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES\nProperty and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses represent the estimated liabilities for reported loss events, IBNR loss events and the related estimated loss adjustment expenses.\nTables 6 and 7 present distributions, by line of business, of the provision for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses gross and net of external reinsurance, respectively.\nTABLE 6 Provision for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses - gross\nAs of December 31 (in thousands of dollars)\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Line of Business\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-standard automobile\n</td> <td>53,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial automobile\n</td> <td>1,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>1,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>55,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 43\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTABLE 7 Provision for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses - net of reinsurance recoverable\nAs of December 31 (in thousands of dollars)\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Line of Business\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-standard automobile\n</td> <td>51,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial automobile\n</td> <td>1,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>1,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>54,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-Standard Automobile\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, the gross provisions for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses for our non-standard automobile business were $53.1 million and $58.5 million, respectively. The decrease is primarily due to the continuing voluntary run-offs of Amigo and MCC.\nCommercial Automobile\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, the gross provisions for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses for our commercial automobile business were $1.4 million and $4.2 million, respectively.

The favorable development in 2014 was primarily related to the decrease in property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses at Amigo and MCC. Original estimates are increased or decreased as additional information becomes known regarding individual claims.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe purpose of liquidity management is to ensure that there is sufficient cash to meet all financial commitments and obligations as they fall due. The liquidity requirements of the Company and its subsidiaries have been met primarily by funds generated from operations, disposal of discontinued operations, investment maturities and income and other returns received on investments. Cash provided from these sources is used primarily for loss and loss adjustment expense payments, debt servicing and other operating expenses. The timing and amount of payments for loss and loss adjustment expenses may differ materially from our provisions for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses, which may create increased liquidity requirements.\nCash Flows\nDuring 2015, the net cash used in operating activities as reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows was $32.8 million. This use of cash can be explained primarily by the loss from continuing operations of $11.4 million, the decrease in the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses of $8.4 million and decrease in other, net of $20.0 million; offset by the loss on deconsolidation of subsidiary of $4.4 million and the decrease in reinsurance recoverable of $2.2 million. The decrease in other, net of $20.0 million primarily relates to the Company's payment to its Trust Preferred trustees of accrued interest which the Company had been deferring since the first quarter of 2011.\nDuring 2015, the net cash provided by investing activities as reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows was $26.2 million. This source of cash was driven primarily by the net proceeds from the sale of ARS of $44.9 million, as further discussed in Note 4, \"Disposition, Deconsolidation and Discontinued Operations,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, partially offset by purchases of fixed maturities, equity investments and limited liability investments in excess of proceeds from sales and maturities of fixed maturities and equity investments.\nDuring 2015, the net cash used in financing activities as reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows was $12.9 million. This use of cash is due to the redemption of C$15.8 million outstanding of LROC preferred units due June 30, 2015, as further discussed in Note 4, \"Disposition, Deconsolidation and Discontinued Operations,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn summary, as reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company's net decrease in cash and cash equivalents during 2015 was $19.5 million.\nThe Company's Insurance Underwriting subsidiaries fund their obligations primarily through premium and investment income and maturities in the investments portfolios. The Company's Insurance Services subsidiaries fund their obligations primarily through service fee and commission income. As a holding company, Kingsway funds its obligations, which primarily consist of interest payments on debt as well as holding company operating expenses, primarily through the sale of subsidiaries and other assets; issuance of debt and equity securities; and receipt of dividends from its non-insurance subsidiaries. On the other hand, the insurance subsidiaries require regulatory approval for the return of capital and, in certain circumstances, prior to the payment of dividends. At December 31, 2015, the U.S. insurance subsidiaries of the Company were restricted from making any dividend payments to the holding company without regulatory approval pursuant to the domiciliary state insurance regulations.\nOn February 3, 2014, the Company closed on its previously announced private placement totaling $6.6 million, as further discussed in Note 19, \"Class A Preferred Stock,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At closing, the Company received gross proceeds of $6.6 million, resulting from the sale and issuance of 262,876 units for a purchase price of $25.00 per unit. Net proceeds to the Company were $6.3 million after deducting expenses.\nOn August 18, 2014, the Company announced its intention to redeem its outstanding series A warrants, which were issued pursuant to the September 2013 rights offering. Holders of series A warrants could exercise their outstanding series A warrants at $4.50 per common share. Any series A warrants that remained unexercised after September 19, 2014 were automatically redeemed by the Company at the redemption price of $0.25 per series A warrant. During 2014, series A warrants to purchase 3,279,945 shares of common stock were exercised, resulting in cash proceeds of $14.8 million. The 845 series A warrants that remained unexercised were redeemed by the Company at the redemption price of $0.25.\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 45\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRegulatory Capital\nIn the United States, a risk-based capital (\"RBC\") formula is used by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\"NAIC\") to identify property and casualty insurance companies that may not be adequately capitalized. In general, insurers reporting surplus as regards policyholders below 200% of the authorized control level, as defined by the NAIC, at December 31 are subject to varying levels of regulatory action, including discontinuation of operations. As of December 31, 2015, surplus as regards policyholders reported by each of our insurance subsidiaries exceeded the 200% threshold.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company began taking steps to place all of Amigo into voluntary run-off. As of December 31, 2012, Amigo's RBC was 157%. In April 2013, Kingsway filed a comprehensive run-off plan with the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, which outlines plans for Amigo's run-off. Amigo remains in compliance with that plan. As of December 31, 2015, Amigo's RBC was 873%.\nKingsway previously placed MCC into voluntary run-off in early 2011. At the time it was placed into voluntary run-off, MCC's RBC was 160%. MCC entered into a comprehensive run-off plan approved by the Illinois Department of Insurance in June 2011. MCC remains in compliance with that plan. As of December 31, 2015, MCC's RBC was 1,111%.\nOur reinsurance subsidiary, which is domiciled in Barbados, is required by the regulator in Barbados to maintain minimum capital levels. As of December 31, 2015, the capital maintained by Kingsway Reinsurance Corporation was in excess of the regulatory capital requirements in Barbados.\nDEBT\nU.S. Senior Note Offering\nOn January 29, 2004, the Company's subsidiary, Kingsway America Inc. (\"KAI\") completed the sale of $100.0 million 7.5% senior notes due 2014. In March 2004, an additional $25.0 million of these senior notes were issued. Interest payments were made on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The notes were fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. The notes were redeemable at KAI's option in whole at any time or in part from time to time on or after February 1, 2009 subject to the conditions stated in the trust indenture.\nKAI subsequently repurchased and retired most of the originally issued par value. In February 2014, KAI repaid the $14.4 million remaining amount outstanding on its senior unsecured debentures due February 1, 2014.\nLROC Preferred Units\nOn July 14, 2005, KLROC Trust completed its public offering of C$78.0 million through the issuance of 3,120,000 LROC 5% preferred units due June 30, 2015, of which the Company was a promoter. KLROC Trust's net proceeds of the public offering was C$74.1 million.\nBeginning in 2009, KFS Capital LLC (\"KFS Capital\"), an affiliate of the Company, began purchasing LROC preferred units. During 2009, KFS Capital acquired 833,715 LROC preferred units. On June 9, 2010, KFS Capital commenced the take-over bid (\"the KLROC Offer\") to acquire up to 750,000 LROC preferred units at a price per unit of C$17.50 in cash. On July 9, 2010, KFS Capital increased the size and price of its previously announced KLROC Offer to 1,500,000 units at a price per unit of C$20.00 in cash. The KLROC Offer expired on July 23, 2010, and 1,525,150 units were tendered, of which 1,500,000 were purchased on a pro-rata basis. The tender was paid for using available cash.\nAs a result of these acquisitions, the Company beneficially owned and controlled 2,333,715 units, representing 74.8% of the issued and outstanding LROC preferred units and began consolidating the financial statements of KLROC Trust effective July 23, 2010. In the consolidated financial statements, the par value of the units owned was netted against the liability related to the LROC preferred units due June 30, 2015. At December 31, 2014, the Company's outstanding net obligation was C$15.8 million.\nDuring the second quarter of 2015, the Company's controlling interest in KLROC Trust was reduced to zero upon the Company's repayment of its C$15.8 million outstanding on its LROC preferred units due June 30, 2015. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash loss on deconsolidation of KLROC Trust of $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This reported loss results from removing the net assets and accumulated other comprehensive loss of KLROC Trust from the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The deconsolidation reduced consolidated shareholders' equity by $2.8 million at June 30, 2015.\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 46\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubordinated Debt\nBetween December 4, 2002 and December 16, 2003, six subsidiary trusts of the Company issued $90.5 million of 30-year capital securities to third-parties in separate private transactions. In each instance, a corresponding floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debenture was then issued by KAI to the trust in exchange for the proceeds from the private sale. The floating rate debentures bear interest at the rate of the London interbank offered interest rate for three-month U.S. dollar deposits (\"LIBOR\"), plus spreads ranging from 3.85% to 4.20%, but until dates ranging from December 4, 2007 to January 8, 2009, the interest rates will not exceed 12.45% to 12.75%. The Company has the right to call each of these securities at par value any time after five years from their issuance until their maturity. During the first quarter of 2011, the Company gave notice to its Trust Preferred trustees of its intention to exercise its voluntary right to defer interest payments for up to 20 quarters, pursuant to the contractual terms of its outstanding indentures, which permit interest deferral. This action does not constitute a default under the Company's Trust Preferred indentures or any of its other debt indentures. On November 6, 2015, the Company paid $22.1 million to its Trust Preferred trustees to be used by the trustees to pay the interest which the Company had been deferring since the first quarter of 2011. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, deferred interest payable of zero and $17.4 million, respectively, is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nTable 9 summarizes cash disbursements related to the Company's contractual obligations projected by period, including debt maturities, interest payments on outstanding debt, the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses and future minimum payments under operating leases. Interest payments in Table 9 related to the subordinated debt assume LIBOR remains constant throughout the projection period.\nOur provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses does not have contractual payment dates. In Table 9 below, we have included a projection of when we expect our unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses to be paid, based on historical payment patterns. The exact timing of the payment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses cannot be predicted with certainty. We maintain an investments portfolio with varying maturities and a substantial amount in short-term investments to provide adequate cash flows for the projected payments in Table 9. The unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses in Table 9 have not been reduced by amounts recoverable from reinsurers.\nTABLE 9 Cash payments related to contractual obligations projected by period\nAs of December 31, 2015 (in thousands of dollars)\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated debt\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on outstanding debt\n</td> <td>4,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses\n</td> <td>37,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Future minimum lease payments\n</td> <td>1,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>43,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>224,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nThe Company has an off-balance sheet arrangement related to a guarantee, which is further described in Note 25, \"Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.", "item_7_truncated": "\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nAll of our investments in fixed maturities and equity investments are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, non-standard automobile insurance accounted for 100.0% of Insurance Underwriting's gross premiums written.\nNet Realized Gains\nImpairment Assessment of Intangible Assets\n\nOur provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses does not have contractual payment dates. In Table 9 below, we have included a projection of when we expect our unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses to be paid, based on historical payment patterns. The exact timing of the payment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses cannot be predicted with certainty. We maintain an investments portfolio with varying maturities and a substantial amount in short-term investments to provide adequate cash flows for the projected payments in Table 9. The unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses in Table 9 have not been reduced by amounts recoverable from reinsurers.\nThe Company's intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Amortization of intangible assets was $1.2 million in 2015 compared to $1.6 million in 2014. The decrease is primarily attributed to less amortization expense related to the IWS VSA in-force intangible asset in 2015 compared to 2014. The VSA in-force asset is amortized over a seven-year term as the corresponding deferred service fees acquired are earned as revenue.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we reported net income of $1.3 million ($0.04 per diluted share) compared to net loss of $11.2 million ($0.75 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 (in thousands of dollars)\nEffective March 31, 2014, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc. (\"PIH\"), formerly known as Maison Insurance Holdings, Inc., completed an initial public offering of its common stock. Upon completion of the transaction, the Company maintained a minority ownership interest in the common shares of PIH. The earnings of PIH are included in the consolidated statements of operations through the March 31, 2014 transaction date. Prior to the transaction, PIH was included in the Insurance Underwriting segment. As a result of the disposal of the Company's majority interest in PIH on March 31, 2014, all segmented information has been restated to exclude PIH from the Insurance Underwriting segment.\nInsurance Underwriting includes the following subsidiaries of the Company: Mendota Insurance Company (\"Mendota\"), Mendakota Insurance Company (\"Mendakota\"), Mendakota Casualty Company (formerly Universal Casualty Company) (\"MCC\"), Kingsway Amigo Insurance Company (\"Amigo\") and Kingsway Reinsurance Corporation. Throughout this 2015 Annual Report, the term \"Insurance Underwriting\" is used to refer to this segment.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, the gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities and equity investments amounted to $2.6 million and $0.7 million, respectively, and there were no unrealized losses attributable to non-investment grade fixed maturities. At each of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, all unrealized losses on individual investments were considered temporary.\nCommercial Automobile\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014 (in thousands of dollars)\nContingent Consideration Benefit\n 32 \nAs of December 31 (in thousands of dollars)\nOn February 3, 2014, the Company closed on its previously announced private placement totaling $6.6 million, as further discussed in Note 19, \"Class A Preferred Stock,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At closing, the Company received gross proceeds of $6.6 million, resulting from the sale and issuance of 262,876 units for a purchase price of $25.00 per unit. Net proceeds to the Company were $6.3 million after deducting expenses.\nThe consideration for certain of the Company's acquisitions includes future payments to the former owners that are contingent upon the achievement of certain targets over future reporting periods. Liabilities for contingent consideration are measured and reported at fair value at the date of acquisition with subsequent changes reported in the consolidated statements of operations as contingent consideration benefit or expense. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is estimated using valuation models designed to estimate the probability of such contingent payments based on various assumptions. Estimated payments are discounted using present value techniques to arrive at the estimated fair value at the balance sheet date. We revalue these contingent consideration liabilities each reporting period. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or multiple inputs, including adjustments to the discount rates or changes in the assumed achievement or timing of any targets. These fair value measurements are based on significant inputs not observable in the market. Management must use judgment in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Changes in assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration benefit or expense reported in the consolidated statements of operations and an impact on the payout of contingent consideration liabilities. Additional information regarding our contingent consideration liabilities is included in Note 23, \"Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn the United States, a risk-based capital (\"RBC\") formula is used by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\"NAIC\") to identify property and casualty insurance companies that may not be adequately capitalized. In general, insurers reporting surplus as regards policyholders below 200% of the authorized control level, as defined by the NAIC, at December 31 are subject to varying levels of regulatory action, including discontinuation of operations. As of December 31, 2015, surplus as regards policyholders reported by each of our insurance subsidiaries exceeded the 200% threshold.\nAs of December 31 (in thousands of dollars, except for percentages)\nThe Insurance Underwriting combined ratio was 101.5% in 2015 compared with 99.2% in 2014, reflecting the dynamics which affected the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio and expense ratio.\nBeginning in 2009, KFS Capital LLC (\"KFS Capital\"), an affiliate of the Company, began purchasing LROC preferred units. During 2009, KFS Capital acquired 833,715 LROC preferred units. On June 9, 2010, KFS Capital commenced the take-over bid (\"the KLROC Offer\") to acquire up to 750,000 LROC preferred units at a price per unit of C$17.50 in cash. On July 9, 2010, KFS Capital increased the size and price of its previously announced KLROC Offer to 1,500,000 units at a price per unit of C$20.00 in cash. The KLROC Offer expired on July 23, 2010, and 1,525,150 units were tendered, of which 1,500,000 were purchased on a pro-rata basis. The tender was paid for using available cash.\n \u2022 assessing the Company's ability and intent to hold these investments at least until the investment impairment is recovered.  The risks and uncertainties inherent in the assessment methodology used to determine declines in market value that are other-than-temporary include, but may not be limited to, the following:\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\n 41 \nGross Premiums Written\nLiquidity and Cash Flow Risk\nThe unfavorable development in 2015 was primarily related to the increase in property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses at Mendota, offset by a decrease in property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses due to the continuing voluntary run-offs of Amigo and MCC. The favorable development in 2014 was primarily related to the decrease in property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses at Amigo and MCC. Original estimates are increased or decreased as additional information becomes known regarding individual claims.\nDuring the second quarter of 2015, the Company's controlling interest in KLROC Trust was reduced to zero upon the Company's repayment of its C$15.8 million outstanding on its LROC preferred units due June 30, 2015. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash loss on deconsolidation of KLROC Trust of $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This reported loss results from removing the net assets and accumulated other comprehensive loss of KLROC Trust from the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The deconsolidation reduced consolidated shareholders' equity by $2.8 million at June 30, 2015.\nBetween December 4, 2002 and December 16, 2003, six subsidiary trusts of the Company issued $90.5 million of 30-year capital securities to third-parties in separate private transactions. In each instance, a corresponding floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debenture was then issued by KAI to the trust in exchange for the proceeds from the private sale. The floating rate debentures bear interest at the rate of the London interbank offered interest rate for three-month U.S. dollar deposits (\"LIBOR\"), plus spreads ranging from 3.85% to 4.20%, but until dates ranging from December 4, 2007 to January 8, 2009, the interest rates will not exceed 12.45% to 12.75%. The Company has the right to call each of these securities at par value any time after five years from their issuance until their maturity. During the first quarter of 2011, the Company gave notice to its Trust Preferred trustees of its intention to exercise its voluntary right to defer interest payments for up to 20 quarters, pursuant to the contractual terms of its outstanding indentures, which permit interest deferral. This action does not constitute a default under the Company's Trust Preferred indentures or any of its other debt indentures. On November 6, 2015, the Company paid $22.1 million to its Trust Preferred trustees to be used by the trustees to pay the interest which the Company had been deferring since the first quarter of 2011. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, deferred interest payable of zero and $17.4 million, respectively, is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nWhile net premiums earned is the related U.S. GAAP measure used in the consolidated statements of operations, gross premiums written is the component of net premiums earned that measures insurance business produced before the impact of ceding reinsurance premiums, but without respect to when those premiums will be recognized as actual revenue. We use this measure as an overall gauge of gross business volume in Insurance Underwriting.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets consist of insurance licenses and trade name. Intangible assets with an indefinite life are assessed for impairment annually as of December 31, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the intangible asset is impaired, a fair value-based impairment test would be required. Management must make estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets that may affect any resulting impairment write-down. This includes assumptions regarding future cash flows and future revenues from the related intangible assets or their reporting units. Management then compares the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets to their respective carrying amounts. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds the fair value of that intangible asset, an impairment is recorded.\nTABLE 5 Limited liability investments\nCredit Risk\nA reconciliation of total segment operating (loss) income to net income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is presented in Table 1 below:\nThe Company owns investments in various limited liability companies (\"LLCs\") and limited partnerships (\"LPs\") that primarily invest in income-producing real estate or real estate related investments. The Company's investments in the LLCs and LPs are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and reported as limited liability investments in the consolidated balance sheets. The real estate investments are held on a triple net lease basis whereby the lessee agrees to pay all real estate taxes, building insurance and maintenance. The real estate investments typically yield between 7.5% - 8% minimum preferred return on invested capital. Table 5 below presents additional information pertaining to the limited liability investments at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n \u2022 the opinions of professional investment managers could be incorrect; \nCash Flows\nNet Investment Income\nOther income and expenses not allocated to segments was a net expense of $3.8 million in 2015 compared to $4.9 million in 2014. The decrease in net expense is primarily the result of a $6.0 million gain recorded during the first quarter of 2015 related to the termination of the Company's Management Services Agreement with PIH, as further discussed in Note 24, \"Related Party Transactions,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, partially offset by less general expense for salaries, employee benefits and professional fees in 2014 as compared to 2015, and $2.3 million of income reported during the first quarter of 2014 related to PIH. As further discussed in Note 4, \"Disposition, Deconsolidation and Discontinued Operations,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective March 31, 2014, PIH completed an initial public offering of its common stock. The earnings of PIH are included in the consolidated statements of operations through the March 31, 2014 transaction date. Prior to the transaction, PIH was included in the Insurance Underwriting segment. As a result of the disposal of the Company's majority interest in PIH on March 31, 2014, all segmented information has been restated to exclude PIH from the Insurance Underwriting segment and to include its earnings in other income and expenses not allocated to segments, net.\n\nTable 4 below summarizes the composition of the fair values of fixed maturities, excluding cash and cash equivalents, at December 31, 2015 and 2014, by rating as assigned by Standard and Poor's (\"S&P\") or Moody's Investors Service (\"Moody's\"). Fixed maturities consist of predominantly high-quality instruments in corporate and government bonds with approximately 90.8% of those investments rated 'A' or better at December 31, 2015. During the first quarter of 2015, the Company received $3.0 million of 8% preferred stock of PIH, redeemable in five years, related to the termination of the Company's Management Services Agreement with PIH, as further discussed in Note 24, \"Related Party Transactions,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preferred stock is not rated.\nLimited Liability Investments\n\nKingsway is a Canadian holding company with operating subsidiaries located in the United States. The Company operates as a merchant bank primarily engaged, through its subsidiaries, in the property and casualty insurance business. Kingsway conducts its business through the following two reportable segments: Insurance Underwriting and Insurance Services.\n\nNet investment income increased to $2.9 million in 2015 compared to $1.6 million in 2014. The increase in 2015 is due to an increase in income from limited liability investments. Income from limited liability investments is recognized based on the Company's share of the earnings of the limited liability entities.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, the gross provisions for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses for our non-standard automobile business were $53.1 million and $58.5 million, respectively. The decrease is primarily due to the continuing voluntary run-offs of Amigo and MCC.\nTrinity is a provider of warranty products and maintenance support to consumers and businesses in the heating, ventilation, air conditioning (\"HVAC\"), standby generator, commercial LED lighting and refrigeration industries. Trinity distributes its warranty products through original equipment manufacturers, HVAC distributors and commercial and residential contractors. Trinity distributes its maintenance support direct through corporate owners of retail spaces throughout the United States.\n 39 \nTable 1 Segment Operating (Loss) Income\n \u2022 obtaining a valuation analysis from third-party investment managers regarding the intrinsic value of these investments based on their knowledge and experience together with market-based valuation techniques; \nKingsway, like many insurance companies, analyzes performance based on underwriting ratios such as loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, expense ratio and combined ratio. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is derived by dividing the amount of net loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred by net premiums earned. The expense ratio is derived by dividing the sum of commissions and premium taxes; general and administrative expenses and policy fee income by net premiums earned. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio and the expense ratio. A combined ratio below 100% demonstrates underwriting profit whereas a combined ratio over 100% demonstrates an underwriting loss.\nAt December 31, 2015, 82.9% of fixed maturities, including treasury bills, government bonds and corporate bonds, had contractual maturities of five years or less. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain issuers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. The Company holds cash and high-grade short-term assets which, along with fixed maturities, management believes are sufficient in amount for the payment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses and other operating subsidiary obligations on a timely basis. In the event that additional cash is required to meet obligations to our policyholders and customers, we believe that the high-quality, liquid investments in the portfolios provide us with sufficient liquidity.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nSegment operating (loss) income represents one measure of the pretax profitability of our segments and is derived by subtracting direct segment expenses from direct segment revenues. Revenues and expenses are presented in the consolidated statements of operations, but are not subtotaled by segment. However, this information is available in total and by segment in Note 22, \"Segmented Information,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, regarding reportable segment information. The nearest comparable U.S. GAAP measure is loss from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit) which, in addition to operating (loss) income, includes net investment income, net realized gains, other-than-temporary impairment loss, other income not allocated to segments, general and administrative expenses, amortization of intangible assets, contingent consideration benefit, impairment of asset held for sale, interest expense, foreign exchange losses, net, (gain) loss on change in fair value of debt, loss on disposal of subsidiary, loss on disposal of asset held for sale, loss on deconsolidation of subsidiary and equity in net loss of investee. A reconciliation of segment operating (loss) income to loss from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit) for the year ended December 31, 2015 is presented in Table 1 of the \"Results of Continuing Operations\" section of MD&A.\nIn summary, as reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company's net decrease in cash and cash equivalents during 2015 was $19.5 million.\nThe purpose of liquidity management is to ensure that there is sufficient cash to meet all financial commitments and obligations as they fall due. The liquidity requirements of the Company and its subsidiaries have been met primarily by funds generated from operations, disposal of discontinued operations, investment maturities and income and other returns received on investments. Cash provided from these sources is used primarily for loss and loss adjustment expense payments, debt servicing and other operating expenses. The timing and amount of payments for loss and loss adjustment expenses may differ materially from our provisions for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses, which may create increased liquidity requirements.\nThe length of time a fixed maturity investment may be held in an unrealized loss position may vary based on the opinion of the investment manager and their respective analyses related to valuation and to the various credit risks that may prevent us from recapturing the principal investment. In the case of a fixed maturity investment where the investment manager determines that there is little or no risk of default prior to the maturity of a holding, we would elect to hold the investment in an unrealized loss position until the price recovers or the investment matures. In situations where facts emerge that might increase the risk associated with recapture of principal, the Company may elect to sell a fixed maturity investment at a loss.\nInterest Expense\nEquity in Net Loss of Investee\nInterest expense for 2015 was $5.3 million compared to $5.6 million in 2014. The decrease is attributable to the repayment during June 2015 of the outstanding principal balance on the LROC preferred units due June 30, 2015.\nGain (Loss) on Change in Fair Value of Debt\nInsurance Services\n\nOur equity investments, including warrants, are recorded at fair value using quoted market values based on latest bid prices, where active markets exist, or models based on significant market observable inputs, where no active markets exist. For fixed maturities, we use observable inputs such as quoted prices in inactive markets, quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments, benchmark interest rates, broker quotes and other relevant inputs. We do not have any investments in our portfolio which require us to use unobservable inputs. Any change in the estimated fair value of our investments could impact the amount of unrealized gain or loss we have recorded, which could change the amount we have recorded for our investments and other comprehensive income (loss) on our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe ultimate realization of the deferred income tax asset balance is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the Company's temporary differences reverse and become deductible. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred income tax asset balance will not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is needed, management considers all available positive and negative evidence affecting specific deferred income tax asset balances, including the Company's past and anticipated future performance, the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, and the availability of tax planning strategies.\n\nOn July 21, 2014, 1347 Capital Corp. completed an initial public offering of 4.0 million units at a price to the public of $10.00 per unit for total gross proceeds of $40.0 million. Each unit issued in the initial public offering consists of one share of common stock, one right to receive one-tenth of a share of common stock automatically on the consummation of an initial business combination, and one warrant to acquire one-half of one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per full share of common stock. On July 23, 2014, the option to purchase an additional 0.6 million units that 1347 Capital Corp. had granted to the underwriters for additional gross proceeds of $6.0 million was completed. As a result, 1347 Capital Corp. issued a total of 4.6 million units in its initial public offering, generating total gross proceeds of $46.0 million.\nIn the year-end actuarial review process, an analysis of the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is completed for each insurance subsidiary and IWS. Unpaid deferred cost containment expenses and unpaid adjusting and other expenses, which are components of the provision for loss adjustment expenses, and unpaid losses are each separately analyzed by line of business and by accident year utilizing a wide range of actuarial methods. These unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are further analyzed by looking separately at case reserves, which are specific reserves established for specific claims, and reserves for losses incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\").\nLoss on Deconsolidation of Subsidiary\nContingent Consideration\nThe establishment of an other-than-temporary impairment on an investment requires a number of judgments and estimates. We perform a quarterly analysis of the individual investments to determine if declines in market value are other-than-temporary. The analysis includes some or all of the following procedures, as applicable:\nThe Insurance Underwriting expense ratio was 27.4% in 2015 compared with 29.5% in 2014. The decrease in the expense ratio is primarily due to an overall reduction in general expenses. The Insurance Underwriting expense ratio includes policy fee income of $8.3 million and $8.1 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\n\nFair Value Assumptions for Debt Obligations\nAs a result of these acquisitions, the Company beneficially owned and controlled 2,333,715 units, representing 74.8% of the issued and outstanding LROC preferred units and began consolidating the financial statements of KLROC Trust effective July 23, 2010. In the consolidated financial statements, the par value of the units owned was netted against the liability related to the LROC preferred units due June 30, 2015. At December 31, 2014, the Company's outstanding net obligation was C$15.8 million.\nLoss on Disposal of Subsidiary\n 36 \n \u2022 the debt service pattern of non-investment grade instruments may not reflect future debt service capabilities and may not reflect a company's unknown underlying financial problems.  As a result of the analysis performed by the Company to determine declines in market value that are other-than-temporary, the Company recorded a write down of $0.0 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to fixed maturities for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company did not recognize any impairment related to its investments that was considered other-than-temporary for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nBecause the investments portfolio is comprised of primarily fixed maturity instruments that are usually held to maturity, periodic changes in interest rate levels generally impact our financial results to the extent that the investments are recorded at market value and reinvestment yields are different than the original yields on maturing instruments. During periods of rising interest rates, the market values of the existing fixed maturities will generally decrease. The reverse is true during periods of declining interest rates.\n 35 \nKAI subsequently repurchased and retired most of the originally issued par value. In February 2014, KAI repaid the $14.4 million remaining amount outstanding on its senior unsecured debentures due February 1, 2014.\n\n \u2022 the credit ratings assigned by independent credit rating agencies may be incorrect due to unforeseen or unknown facts related to a company's financial situation; and \nObjective positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for all or a portion of a company's deferred income tax asset balances when significant negative evidence exists. Cumulative losses are the most compelling form of negative evidence considered by management in this determination. To the extent a valuation allowance is established in a period, an expense must be recorded within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2015, the Company maintains a valuation allowance of $283.6 million, $277.1 million of which relates to its U.S. deferred income taxes. The largest component of the U.S. deferred income tax asset balance relates to tax loss carryforwards that have arisen as a result of losses generated from the Company's U.S. operations. Uncertainty over the Company's ability to utilize these losses over the short-term has led the Company to record a valuation allowance.\n\n \u2022 identifying other circumstances which management believes may impact the recoverability of the unrealized loss positions; \n \u2022 determining the necessary provision for declines in market value that are considered other-than-temporary based on the analyses performed; and \nThe Company has an off-balance sheet arrangement related to a guarantee, which is further described in Note 25, \"Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuring 2015, the Company incurred foreign exchange losses, net of $1.2 million compared to $0.4 million in 2014. Foreign exchange losses, net for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were incurred primarily related to conversion of the net Canadian dollar assets of Kingsway Linked Return of Capital Trust (\"KLROC Trust\").\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, the gross provisions for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses for our commercial automobile business were $1.4 million and $4.2 million, respectively. This decrease is due to the continuing voluntary run-offs of Amigo and MCC.\nThe Insurance Services service fee and commission income decreased 6.9% to $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was due to decreased service fee and commission income at IWS. The Insurance Services operating loss was $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with operating income of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in operating loss is primarily related to decreased service fee and commission income at IWS and increased general and administrative expenses at Trinity for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.\nFuture events may result in the valuation allowance being adjusted, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. If sufficient positive evidence were to arise in the future indicating that all or a portion of the deferred income tax assets would meet the more likely than not standard, the valuation allowance would be reversed in the period that such a conclusion was reached.\nFollowing is a list of non-U.S. GAAP measures found throughout this report with their definitions, relationships to U.S. GAAP measures and explanations of their importance to our operations.\nSegment Operating (Loss) Income\n\nIWS is a licensed motor vehicle service agreement company and is a provider of after-market vehicle protection services distributed by credit unions in 26 states to their members.\n1347 Capital Corp. has 24 months from July 21, 2014, the date of the initial public offering, to complete a successful business combination. Had a successful business combination been consummated during 2015, and assuming the December 31, 2015 closing stock price for 1347 Capital Corp. common shares, the Company estimates the increase in its shareholders' equity would have been approximately $5.8 million at December 31, 2015. There can be no assurance that 1347 Capital Corp. will complete a successful business combination. In the event 1347 Capital Corp. does not complete a successful business combination, the Company estimates its shareholders' equity would decrease by approximately $1.8 million.\nWhile net premiums earned is the related U.S. GAAP measure used in the consolidated statements of operations, net premiums written is the component of net premiums earned that measures the difference between gross premiums written and the impact of ceding reinsurance premiums, but without respect to when those premiums will be recognized as actual revenue. We use this measure as an indication of retained or net business volume in Insurance Underwriting.\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment annually as of December 31, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the goodwill is impaired, a fair value-based impairment test would be required. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process that requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation. The first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on valuation techniques, including a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts, and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, which includes the allocated goodwill. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment, if any, by determining an implied fair value of goodwill. The determination of the implied fair value of goodwill of a reporting unit requires management to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. Any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill, which is compared to its corresponding carrying value. For reporting units with a negative book value, qualitative factors are evaluated to determine whether it is necessary to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test. Additional information regarding our goodwill is included in Note 9, \"Goodwill,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInvestment in Investee\nThe Company performs a quarterly analysis of its investment portfolio to determine if declines in market value are other-than-temporary. Further information regarding our detailed analysis and factors considered in establishing an other-than-temporary impairment on an investment is discussed within the \"Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions\" section of MD&A.\nValuation of Fixed Maturities and Equity Investments\nDue to the inherent volatility of equity markets, we believe an equity investment may trade from time to time below its intrinsic value based on historical valuation measures. In these situations, an equity investment may be maintained in an unrealized loss position for different periods of time based on the underlying economic assumptions driving the investment manager's valuation of the holding.\nWe measure derivative financial instruments at fair value. Warrants are recorded at fair value using quoted market values based on latest bid prices, where active markets exist, or models based on significant market observable inputs, where no active markets exist. The performance shares, for which no active market exists, are required to be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Company. Such determination of fair value would require us to develop a model based upon relevant observable market inputs as well as significant unobservable inputs, including developing a sufficiently reliable estimate for an appropriate discount to reflect the illiquidity and unique structure of the security. The Company determined that its model for the performance shares was not sufficiently reliable. As a result, we have assigned a fair value of zero to the performance shares. The fair value of derivative financial instruments is required to be revalued each reporting period, with corresponding changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations, or, in the case of derivative financial instruments that are actively traded, in other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains or losses are recognized upon settlement of the contracts.\nA significant degree of judgment is required to determine amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements for the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses. The process for establishing the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses reflects the uncertainties and significant judgmental factors inherent in predicting future results of both known and unknown loss events. As such, the process is inherently complex and imprecise and estimates are constantly refined. The process of establishing the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses relies on the judgment and opinions of a large number of individuals, including the opinions of the Company's actuaries. Further information regarding estimates used in determining our provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is discussed in the Unpaid Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses\u201d section of Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report and Note 12, \"Unpaid Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTables 6 and 7 present distributions, by line of business, of the provision for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses gross and net of external reinsurance, respectively.\n\nTABLE 9 Cash payments related to contractual obligations projected by period\nSubordinated Debt\nThe gain on change in fair value of debt amounted to $1.5 million in 2015 compared to a loss of $11.0 million in 2014. The 2015 gain is primarily due to a decrease in the fair values of the subordinated debt and LROC preferred units, whereas the 2014 loss is due to an increase in the fair value of the Company's subordinated debt, partially offset by a decrease in the fair value of the LROC preferred units. For information regarding the Company's approach to determining fair value of debt, see Note 23, \"Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAdditional information regarding our intangible assets is included in Note 10, \"Intangible Assets,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n 40 \nDeferred Acquisition Costs\nOn July 14, 2005, KLROC Trust completed its public offering of C$78.0 million through the issuance of 3,120,000 LROC 5% preferred units due June 30, 2015, of which the Company was a promoter. KLROC Trust's net proceeds of the public offering was C$74.1 million.\nThroughout this 2015 Annual Report, we present our operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful, useful and transparent to anyone using this financial information to evaluate our performance. In addition to the U.S. GAAP presentation of net income (loss), we show certain statutory reporting information and other non-U.S. GAAP financial measures that we believe are relevant in managing our business and drawing comparisons to our peers. These measures are segment operating (loss) income, gross premiums written, net premiums written and underwriting ratios.\nEffective March 31, 2014, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, PIH, completed an initial public offering of its common stock. Upon completion of the transaction, the Company maintained a minority ownership interest in the common shares of PIH. As a result of the disposal, the Company recognized a loss of $1.2 million in 2014. See Note 4, \"Disposition, Deconsolidation and Discontinued Operations,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further details.\nAs of December 31 (in thousands of dollars)\n\nThe Company's Insurance Underwriting subsidiaries fund their obligations primarily through premium and investment income and maturities in the investments portfolios. The Company's Insurance Services subsidiaries fund their obligations primarily through service fee and commission income. As a holding company, Kingsway funds its obligations, which primarily consist of interest payments on debt as well as holding company operating expenses, primarily through the sale of subsidiaries and other assets; issuance of debt and equity securities; and receipt of dividends from its non-insurance subsidiaries. On the other hand, the insurance subsidiaries require regulatory approval for the return of capital and, in certain circumstances, prior to the payment of dividends. At December 31, 2015, the U.S. insurance subsidiaries of the Company were restricted from making any dividend payments to the holding company without regulatory approval pursuant to the domiciliary state insurance regulations.\nInformation with respect to development of our provision for prior years' property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is presented in Table 8.\n 42 \n \u2022 identifying all unrealized loss positions that have existed for at least six months; \nInsurance Underwriting\nIntangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Intangible assets with definite useful lives consist of vehicle service agreements in-force (\"VSA in-force\"), database and customer-related relationships. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If circumstances require that a definite-lived intangible asset be tested for possible impairment, we first compare the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that definite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the definite-lived intangible asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.\nGoodwill Recoverability\nTABLE 6 Provision for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses - gross\nItem 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNon-Standard Automobile\nThe Company incurred net realized gains of $1.2 million in 2015 compared to $5.0 million in 2014. The net realized gains in 2015 resulted primarily from the liquidation of limited liability investments in Insurance Underwriting. The net realized gains in 2014 resulted primarily from the liquidation of equity investments in Insurance Underwriting.\nPROPERTY AND CASUALTY UNPAID LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES\nDEBT\nDeferred acquisition costs represent the deferral of expenses that we incur related to successful efforts to acquire new business or renew existing business. Acquisition costs, primarily commissions, premium taxes and underwriting and agency expenses related to issuing insurance policies and vehicle service agreements, are deferred and charged against income ratably over the terms of the related insurance policies and vehicle service agreements. Management regularly reviews the categories of acquisition costs that are deferred and assesses the recoverability of this asset. For Insurance Underwriting, a premium deficiency and a corresponding charge to income is recognized if the sum of the expected losses and loss adjustment expenses, unamortized acquisition costs and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums and anticipated net investment income.\nMarket Risk\nRESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS\nFactors affecting the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses include the continually evolving and changing regulatory and legal environment; actuarial studies; the professional experience and expertise of the Company's claims personnel and independent adjusters retained to handle individual claims; the quality of the data used for projection purposes; existing claims management practices including claims handling and settlement practices; the effect of inflationary trends on future loss settlement costs; court decisions; economic conditions; and public attitudes.\nThe Insurance Underwriting operating loss increased to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to operating income of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in operating loss is primarily attributed to an increase in loss and loss adjustment expenses, partially offset by an increase in net premiums earned and a decrease in general expenses in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nTable 3 below summarizes the fair value by contractual maturities of the fixed maturities portfolio, excluding cash and cash equivalents, at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nThe Company previously placed Amigo and MCC into voluntary run-off in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Each of Amigo and MCC entered into a comprehensive run-off plan which was approved by its respective state of domicile. Kingsway continues to manage Amigo and MCC in a manner consistent with the run-off plans. During the first quarter of 2015, MCC sent a letter of intent to the Illinois Department of Insurance to resume writing private passenger automobile policies in the state of Illinois. MCC began writing these policies on April 1, 2015.\nAs of December 31\n\nINVESTMENTS\n 44 \nDuring 2015, the net cash used in operating activities as reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows was $32.8 million. This use of cash can be explained primarily by the loss from continuing operations of $11.4 million, the decrease in the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses of $8.4 million and decrease in other, net of $20.0 million; offset by the loss on deconsolidation of subsidiary of $4.4 million and the decrease in reinsurance recoverable of $2.2 million. The decrease in other, net of $20.0 million primarily relates to the Company's payment to its Trust Preferred trustees of accrued interest which the Company had been deferring since the first quarter of 2011.\n\nForeign Exchange Losses, Net\nOur Linked Return of Capital (\"LROC\") preferred units due June 30, 2015 and subordinated debt are measured and reported at fair value. The fair value of the LROC preferred units was based on quoted market prices prior to redemption in June 2015, and the fair value of the subordinated debt is calculated by a third-party using a model based on significant market observable inputs. Any change in the estimated fair value of our debt is reflected in the gain or loss on change in fair value of debt we record in the consolidated statements of operations and in the carrying value for our debt on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nAs of December 31 (in thousands of dollars, except for percentages)\nOther Income and Expenses not Allocated to Segments, Net\nTABLE 4 Credit ratings of fixed maturities\n\n 33 \n \u2022 assessing if declines in market value are other-than-temporary for any debt instrument with a non-investment grade credit rating based on the continuity of its debt service record; \nTABLE 8 Increase (decrease) in prior years' provision for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses by line of business and accident year\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company owns 61.0% of the outstanding units of 1347 Investors LLC (\"1347 Investors\"). Because the Company owns more than 50% of the outstanding units, 1347 Investors is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2015. 1347 Investors has an investment in the common stock and private units of 1347 Capital Corp. which is reflected as investment in investee in the consolidated balance sheets. 1347 Capital Corp. was formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities.\nContingent consideration benefit was $1.1 million in 2015 compared to $2.2 million in 2014. Contingent consideration liabilities resulting from the acquisitions of IWS and Trinity were estimated at their respective acquisition dates using valuation models designed to estimate the probability of such contingent payments based on various assumptions. The valuation models assume certain achievement of targets, discount rates related to riskiness of the projections used and the time value of money to calculate the net present value of future consideration payments. Each reporting period, the Company reevaluates its contingent consideration liabilities and, if significant, makes adjustments to the recorded liabilities. As a result of the analyses performed in 2015 and 2014, the Company decreased contingent consideration liabilities by $1.5 million and $3.0 million, respectively, during the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2014, resulting in a total liability of $2.0 million and $3.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015 and 2014, which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 23, \"Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further details.\nThe provision for income taxes is calculated based on the expected tax treatment of transactions recorded in our consolidated financial statements. In determining our provision for income taxes, we interpret tax legislation in a variety of jurisdictions and make assumptions about the expected timing of the reversal of deferred income tax assets and liabilities and the valuation of deferred income taxes.\nNet Premiums Written\nFor the years ended December 31 (in thousands of dollars)\nThe net movements in prior years' provisions for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance, was an increase of $0.6 million and a decrease of $5.1 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Table 8 identifies the relative contribution of the increases (decreases) in the provisions for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses attributable to the respective lines of business and accident years.\n\nOur reinsurance subsidiary, which is domiciled in Barbados, is required by the regulator in Barbados to maintain minimum capital levels. As of December 31, 2015, the capital maintained by Kingsway Reinsurance Corporation was in excess of the regulatory capital requirements in Barbados.\nTable 2 below summarizes the carrying value of investments, including cash and cash equivalents, at the dates indicated.\n\nThe Insurance Underwriting loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for 2015 was 74.1% compared to 69.7% in 2014. The increase in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is primarily attributable to lower favorable development related to property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses at Amigo and MCC in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the continuing voluntary run-offs of Amigo and MCC.\nAs of December 31, 2015 (in thousands of dollars)\nMarket risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in interest or currency exchange rates and equity prices. Given our U.S. operations typically invest in U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturity instruments, our primary market risk exposures in the investments portfolio are to changes in interest rates.\n\nEffective April 1, 2015, the Company closed on the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary, Assigned Risk Solutions Ltd. (\"ARS\"). As a result, ARS has been classified as discontinued operations and the results of their operations are reported separately for all periods presented. Prior to the transaction, ARS was included in the Insurance Services segment. As a result of classifying ARS as a discontinued operation, all segmented information has been restated to exclude ARS from the Insurance Services segment.\nDerivative financial instruments include investments in warrants and performance shares issued to the Company under various performance share grant agreements. Refer to Note 24, \"Related Party Transactions,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further details regarding the performance shares. Warrants are classified as equity investments in the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates and their underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in estimates are recorded in the accounting period in which they are determined. The critical accounting estimates and assumptions in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses; valuation of fixed maturities and equity investments; valuation of deferred income taxes; impairment assessment of intangible assets; goodwill recoverability; deferred acquisition costs; fair value assumptions for performance shares; fair value assumptions for debt obligations; and contingent consideration.\n 34 \nOn August 18, 2014, the Company announced its intention to redeem its outstanding series A warrants, which were issued pursuant to the September 2013 rights offering. Holders of series A warrants could exercise their outstanding series A warrants at $4.50 per common share. Any series A warrants that remained unexercised after September 19, 2014 were automatically redeemed by the Company at the redemption price of $0.25 per series A warrant. During 2014, series A warrants to purchase 3,279,945 shares of common stock were exercised, resulting in cash proceeds of $14.8 million. The 845 series A warrants that remained unexercised were redeemed by the Company at the redemption price of $0.25.\nNON U.S.-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred a loss from continuing operations of $11.4 million ($0.60 per diluted share) compared to $14.7 million ($0.95 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2014. The loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily attributable to operating loss in Insurance Underwriting and Insurance Services, income and expenses not allocated to segments, interest expense, and loss on deconsolidation of subsidiary, partially offset by net investment income and gain on change in fair value of debt. The loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 is attributable to income and expenses not allocated to segments, impairment of asset held for sale, interest expense, loss on change in fair value of debt and loss on disposal of subsidiary, partially offset by net realized gains, contingent consideration benefit and operating income in Insurance Services and Insurance Underwriting.", "item_7_text": "\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nAll of our investments in fixed maturities and equity investments are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value. At December 31, 2015, we held cash and cash equivalents and investments with a carrying value of $159.4 million. As of December 31, 2015, we held an investments portfolio comprised primarily of fixed maturities issued by the U.S. Government, government agencies and high quality corporate issuers. Investments held by our insurance subsidiaries must comply with applicable domiciliary state regulations that prescribe the type, quality and concentration of investments. Our U.S. operations typically invest in U.S. dollar-denominated instruments to mitigate their exposure to currency rate fluctuations.\nTable 9 summarizes cash disbursements related to the Company's contractual obligations projected by period, including debt maturities, interest payments on outstanding debt, the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses and future minimum payments under operating leases. Interest payments in Table 9 related to the subordinated debt assume LIBOR remains constant throughout the projection period.\n 38 \n 31 \nCredit risk is defined as the risk of financial loss due to failure of the other party to a financial instrument to discharge an obligation. Credit risk arises from our positions in short-term investments, corporate debt instruments and government bonds.\nThe Company utilizes external actuaries to evaluate the adequacy of our provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses under the terms of our insurance policies and vehicle service agreements. The provision is evaluated by the Company's actuaries with the results then shared with management, which is responsible for establishing the provision recorded in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nGains and losses realized on the disposition of investments are determined on the first-in first-out basis and credited or charged to the consolidated statements of operations. Premium and discount on investments are amortized and accredited using the interest method and charged or credited to net investment income.\nAs a result of the analysis performed by the Company to determine declines in market value that are other-than-temporary, the Company recorded a write down of $0.0 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to fixed maturities for the year ended December 31, 2015. There were no write-downs for other-than-temporary impairments related to investments for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nKingsway previously placed MCC into voluntary run-off in early 2011. At the time it was placed into voluntary run-off, MCC's RBC was 160%. MCC entered into a comprehensive run-off plan approved by the Illinois Department of Insurance in June 2011. MCC remains in compliance with that plan. As of December 31, 2015, MCC's RBC was 1,111%.\nPrior to the second quarter of 2015, the Company beneficially owned and controlled 74.8% of KLROC Trust. As a result, the Company had been consolidating the financial statements of KLROC Trust. During the second quarter of 2015, the Company's controlling interest in KLROC Trust was reduced to zero upon the Company's repayment of its C$15.8 million outstanding on its LROC preferred units due June 30, 2015. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash loss on deconsolidation of subsidiary of $4.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. This reported loss results from removing the net assets and accumulated other comprehensive loss of KLROC Trust from the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The deconsolidation reduced consolidated shareholders' equity by $2.8 million at June 30, 2015. Refer to Note 4, \"Disposition, Deconsolidation and Discontinued Operations,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion.\n \u2022 the past trading patterns of individual investments may not reflect future valuation trends; \nDuring 2015, the net cash used in financing activities as reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows was $12.9 million. This use of cash is due to the redemption of C$15.8 million outstanding of LROC preferred units due June 30, 2015, as further discussed in Note 4, \"Disposition, Deconsolidation and Discontinued Operations,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, Insurance Underwriting gross premiums written were $116.4 million compared to $114.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, representing a 2.1% increase. Net premiums written decreased 1.5% to $116.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with $118.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net premiums earned increased 3.4% to $117.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with $113.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in gross premiums written and net premiums earned results primarily from increased premium volumes written in Florida during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to prior year.\n 46 \nBecause the establishment of the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates, current provisions may need to be updated. Adjustments to the provision, both favorable and unfavorable, are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations for the periods in which such estimates are updated. The Company's actuaries develop a range of reasonable estimates and a point estimate of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses. The actuarial point estimate is intended to represent the actuaries' best estimate and will not necessarily be at the mid-point of the high and low estimates of the range.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company began taking steps to place all of Amigo into voluntary run-off. As of December 31, 2012, Amigo's RBC was 157%. In April 2013, Kingsway filed a comprehensive run-off plan with the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, which outlines plans for Amigo's run-off. Amigo remains in compliance with that plan. As of December 31, 2015, Amigo's RBC was 873%.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment\n\nTABLE 3 Fair value of fixed maturities by contractual maturity date\nImpairment of Asset Held for Sale\nDuring 2015, the net cash provided by investing activities as reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows was $26.2 million. This source of cash was driven primarily by the net proceeds from the sale of ARS of $44.9 million, as further discussed in Note 4, \"Disposition, Deconsolidation and Discontinued Operations,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, partially offset by purchases of fixed maturities, equity investments and limited liability investments in excess of proceeds from sales and maturities of fixed maturities and equity investments.\n\nPrior to the fourth quarter of 2014, property consisting of building and land located in Miami, Florida with a carrying value of $5.2 million was classified as held for sale. As a result of declines in the fair value of the property, the Company recorded an impairment write-down of $1.2 million related to the asset held for sale during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAs of December 31 (in thousands of dollars)\nUnderwriting Ratios\nOVERVIEW\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company completed a sale and leaseback transaction involving building and land located in Miami, Florida, which was previously recorded as asset held for sale. Net proceeds were $4.3 million after deducting direct costs of the transaction. The Company recognized a loss of $0.1 million equal to the difference between the fair market value and the carrying value of the property at the date of the transaction.

(\"KAI\") completed the sale of $100.0 million 7.5% senior notes due 2014. In March 2004, an additional $25.0 million of these senior notes were issued. Interest payments were made on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The notes were fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. The notes were redeemable at KAI's option in whole at any time or in part from time to time on or after February 1, 2009 subject to the conditions stated in the trust indenture.\n 45 \nLROC Preferred Units\nEquity in net loss of investee of $0.3 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, represents the loss related to the Company's investment in 1347 Capital Corp.

Insurance Underwriting has policyholders in 12 states; however new business is accepted in only nine states. In 2015, production in the following states represented 84.8% of Insurance Underwriting's gross premiums written: Florida (24.0%), Texas (16.3%), Illinois (15.7%), California (10.3%), Nevada (9.9%) and Colorado (8.6%). For the year ended December 31, 2015, non-standard automobile insurance accounted for 100.0% of Insurance Underwriting's gross premiums written.\nNet Realized Gains\nImpairment Assessment of Intangible Assets\n\nOur provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses does not have contractual payment dates. In Table 9 below, we have included a projection of when we expect our unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses to be paid, based on historical payment patterns. The exact timing of the payment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses cannot be predicted with certainty. We maintain an investments portfolio with varying maturities and a substantial amount in short-term investments to provide adequate cash flows for the projected payments in Table 9. The unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses in Table 9 have not been reduced by amounts recoverable from reinsurers.\nThe Company's intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Amortization of intangible assets was $1.2 million in 2015 compared to $1.6 million in 2014. The decrease is primarily attributed to less amortization expense related to the IWS VSA in-force intangible asset in 2015 compared to 2014. The VSA in-force asset is amortized over a seven-year term as the corresponding deferred service fees acquired are earned as revenue.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we reported net income of $1.3 million ($0.04 per diluted share) compared to net loss of $11.2 million ($0.75 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 (in thousands of dollars)\nEffective March 31, 2014, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc. (\"PIH\"), formerly known as Maison Insurance Holdings, Inc., completed an initial public offering of its common stock. Upon completion of the transaction, the Company maintained a minority ownership interest in the common shares of PIH. The earnings of PIH are included in the consolidated statements of operations through the March 31, 2014 transaction date. Prior to the transaction, PIH was included in the Insurance Underwriting segment. As a result of the disposal of the Company's majority interest in PIH on March 31, 2014, all segmented information has been restated to exclude PIH from the Insurance Underwriting segment.\nInsurance Underwriting includes the following subsidiaries of the Company: Mendota Insurance Company (\"Mendota\"), Mendakota Insurance Company (\"Mendakota\"), Mendakota Casualty Company (formerly Universal Casualty Company) (\"MCC\"), Kingsway Amigo Insurance Company (\"Amigo\") and Kingsway Reinsurance Corporation. Throughout this 2015 Annual Report, the term \"Insurance Underwriting\" is used to refer to this segment.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, the gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities and equity investments amounted to $2.6 million and $0.7 million, respectively, and there were no unrealized losses attributable to non-investment grade fixed maturities. At each of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, all unrealized losses on individual investments were considered temporary.\nCommercial Automobile\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014 (in thousands of dollars)\nContingent Consideration Benefit\n 32 \nAs of December 31 (in thousands of dollars)\nOn February 3, 2014, the Company closed on its previously announced private placement totaling $6.6 million, as further discussed in Note 19, \"Class A Preferred Stock,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At closing, the Company received gross proceeds of $6.6 million, resulting from the sale and issuance of 262,876 units for a purchase price of $25.00 per unit. Net proceeds to the Company were $6.3 million after deducting expenses.\nThe consideration for certain of the Company's acquisitions includes future payments to the former owners that are contingent upon the achievement of certain targets over future reporting periods. Liabilities for contingent consideration are measured and reported at fair value at the date of acquisition with subsequent changes reported in the consolidated statements of operations as contingent consideration benefit or expense. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is estimated using valuation models designed to estimate the probability of such contingent payments based on various assumptions. Estimated payments are discounted using present value techniques to arrive at the estimated fair value at the balance sheet date. We revalue these contingent consideration liabilities each reporting period. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or multiple inputs, including adjustments to the discount rates or changes in the assumed achievement or timing of any targets. These fair value measurements are based on significant inputs not observable in the market. Management must use judgment in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Changes in assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration benefit or expense reported in the consolidated statements of operations and an impact on the payout of contingent consideration liabilities. Additional information regarding our contingent consideration liabilities is included in Note 23, \"Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn the United States, a risk-based capital (\"RBC\") formula is used by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\"NAIC\") to identify property and casualty insurance companies that may not be adequately capitalized. In general, insurers reporting surplus as regards policyholders below 200% of the authorized control level, as defined by the NAIC, at December 31 are subject to varying levels of regulatory action, including discontinuation of operations. As of December 31, 2015, surplus as regards policyholders reported by each of our insurance subsidiaries exceeded the 200% threshold.\nAs of December 31 (in thousands of dollars, except for percentages)\nThe Insurance Underwriting combined ratio was 101.5% in 2015 compared with 99.2% in 2014, reflecting the dynamics which affected the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio and expense ratio.\nBeginning in 2009, KFS Capital LLC (\"KFS Capital\"), an affiliate of the Company, began purchasing LROC preferred units. During 2009, KFS Capital acquired 833,715 LROC preferred units. On June 9, 2010, KFS Capital commenced the take-over bid (\"the KLROC Offer\") to acquire up to 750,000 LROC preferred units at a price per unit of C$17.50 in cash. On July 9, 2010, KFS Capital increased the size and price of its previously announced KLROC Offer to 1,500,000 units at a price per unit of C$20.00 in cash. The KLROC Offer expired on July 23, 2010, and 1,525,150 units were tendered, of which 1,500,000 were purchased on a pro-rata basis. The tender was paid for using available cash.\n \u2022 assessing the Company's ability and intent to hold these investments at least until the investment impairment is recovered.  The risks and uncertainties inherent in the assessment methodology used to determine declines in market value that are other-than-temporary include, but may not be limited to, the following:\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\n 41 \nGross Premiums Written\nLiquidity and Cash Flow Risk\nThe unfavorable development in 2015 was primarily related to the increase in property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses at Mendota, offset by a decrease in property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses due to the continuing voluntary run-offs of Amigo and MCC. The favorable development in 2014 was primarily related to the decrease in property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses at Amigo and MCC. Original estimates are increased or decreased as additional information becomes known regarding individual claims.\nDuring the second quarter of 2015, the Company's controlling interest in KLROC Trust was reduced to zero upon the Company's repayment of its C$15.8 million outstanding on its LROC preferred units due June 30, 2015. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash loss on deconsolidation of KLROC Trust of $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This reported loss results from removing the net assets and accumulated other comprehensive loss of KLROC Trust from the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The deconsolidation reduced consolidated shareholders' equity by $2.8 million at June 30, 2015.\nBetween December 4, 2002 and December 16, 2003, six subsidiary trusts of the Company issued $90.5 million of 30-year capital securities to third-parties in separate private transactions. In each instance, a corresponding floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debenture was then issued by KAI to the trust in exchange for the proceeds from the private sale. The floating rate debentures bear interest at the rate of the London interbank offered interest rate for three-month U.S. dollar deposits (\"LIBOR\"), plus spreads ranging from 3.85% to 4.20%, but until dates ranging from December 4, 2007 to January 8, 2009, the interest rates will not exceed 12.45% to 12.75%. The Company has the right to call each of these securities at par value any time after five years from their issuance until their maturity. During the first quarter of 2011, the Company gave notice to its Trust Preferred trustees of its intention to exercise its voluntary right to defer interest payments for up to 20 quarters, pursuant to the contractual terms of its outstanding indentures, which permit interest deferral. This action does not constitute a default under the Company's Trust Preferred indentures or any of its other debt indentures. On November 6, 2015, the Company paid $22.1 million to its Trust Preferred trustees to be used by the trustees to pay the interest which the Company had been deferring since the first quarter of 2011. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, deferred interest payable of zero and $17.4 million, respectively, is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nWhile net premiums earned is the related U.S. GAAP measure used in the consolidated statements of operations, gross premiums written is the component of net premiums earned that measures insurance business produced before the impact of ceding reinsurance premiums, but without respect to when those premiums will be recognized as actual revenue. We use this measure as an overall gauge of gross business volume in Insurance Underwriting.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets consist of insurance licenses and trade name. Intangible assets with an indefinite life are assessed for impairment annually as of December 31, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the intangible asset is impaired, a fair value-based impairment test would be required. Management must make estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets that may affect any resulting impairment write-down. This includes assumptions regarding future cash flows and future revenues from the related intangible assets or their reporting units. Management then compares the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets to their respective carrying amounts. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds the fair value of that intangible asset, an impairment is recorded.\nTABLE 5 Limited liability investments\nCredit Risk\nA reconciliation of total segment operating (loss) income to net income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is presented in Table 1 below:\nThe Company owns investments in various limited liability companies (\"LLCs\") and limited partnerships (\"LPs\") that primarily invest in income-producing real estate or real estate related investments. The Company's investments in the LLCs and LPs are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and reported as limited liability investments in the consolidated balance sheets. The real estate investments are held on a triple net lease basis whereby the lessee agrees to pay all real estate taxes, building insurance and maintenance. The real estate investments typically yield between 7.5% - 8% minimum preferred return on invested capital. Table 5 below presents additional information pertaining to the limited liability investments at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n \u2022 the opinions of professional investment managers could be incorrect; \nCash Flows\nNet Investment Income\nOther income and expenses not allocated to segments was a net expense of $3.8 million in 2015 compared to $4.9 million in 2014. The decrease in net expense is primarily the result of a $6.0 million gain recorded during the first quarter of 2015 related to the termination of the Company's Management Services Agreement with PIH, as further discussed in Note 24, \"Related Party Transactions,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, partially offset by less general expense for salaries, employee benefits and professional fees in 2014 as compared to 2015, and $2.3 million of income reported during the first quarter of 2014 related to PIH. As further discussed in Note 4, \"Disposition, Deconsolidation and Discontinued Operations,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective March 31, 2014, PIH completed an initial public offering of its common stock. The earnings of PIH are included in the consolidated statements of operations through the March 31, 2014 transaction date. Prior to the transaction, PIH was included in the Insurance Underwriting segment. As a result of the disposal of the Company's majority interest in PIH on March 31, 2014, all segmented information has been restated to exclude PIH from the Insurance Underwriting segment and to include its earnings in other income and expenses not allocated to segments, net.\n\nTable 4 below summarizes the composition of the fair values of fixed maturities, excluding cash and cash equivalents, at December 31, 2015 and 2014, by rating as assigned by Standard and Poor's (\"S&P\") or Moody's Investors Service (\"Moody's\"). Fixed maturities consist of predominantly high-quality instruments in corporate and government bonds with approximately 90.8% of those investments rated 'A' or better at December 31, 2015. During the first quarter of 2015, the Company received $3.0 million of 8% preferred stock of PIH, redeemable in five years, related to the termination of the Company's Management Services Agreement with PIH, as further discussed in Note 24, \"Related Party Transactions,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preferred stock is not rated.\nLimited Liability Investments\n\nKingsway is a Canadian holding company with operating subsidiaries located in the United States. The Company operates as a merchant bank primarily engaged, through its subsidiaries, in the property and casualty insurance business. Kingsway conducts its business through the following two reportable segments: Insurance Underwriting and Insurance Services.\n\nNet investment income increased to $2.9 million in 2015 compared to $1.6 million in 2014. The increase in 2015 is due to an increase in income from limited liability investments. Income from limited liability investments is recognized based on the Company's share of the earnings of the limited liability entities.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, the gross provisions for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses for our non-standard automobile business were $53.1 million and $58.5 million, respectively. The decrease is primarily due to the continuing voluntary run-offs of Amigo and MCC.\nTrinity is a provider of warranty products and maintenance support to consumers and businesses in the heating, ventilation, air conditioning (\"HVAC\"), standby generator, commercial LED lighting and refrigeration industries. Trinity distributes its warranty products through original equipment manufacturers, HVAC distributors and commercial and residential contractors. Trinity distributes its maintenance support direct through corporate owners of retail spaces throughout the United States.\n 39 \nTable 1 Segment Operating (Loss) Income\n \u2022 obtaining a valuation analysis from third-party investment managers regarding the intrinsic value of these investments based on their knowledge and experience together with market-based valuation techniques; \nKingsway, like many insurance companies, analyzes performance based on underwriting ratios such as loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, expense ratio and combined ratio. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is derived by dividing the amount of net loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred by net premiums earned. The expense ratio is derived by dividing the sum of commissions and premium taxes; general and administrative expenses and policy fee income by net premiums earned. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio and the expense ratio. A combined ratio below 100% demonstrates underwriting profit whereas a combined ratio over 100% demonstrates an underwriting loss.\nAt December 31, 2015, 82.9% of fixed maturities, including treasury bills, government bonds and corporate bonds, had contractual maturities of five years or less. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain issuers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. The Company holds cash and high-grade short-term assets which, along with fixed maturities, management believes are sufficient in amount for the payment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses and other operating subsidiary obligations on a timely basis. In the event that additional cash is required to meet obligations to our policyholders and customers, we believe that the high-quality, liquid investments in the portfolios provide us with sufficient liquidity.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nSegment operating (loss) income represents one measure of the pretax profitability of our segments and is derived by subtracting direct segment expenses from direct segment revenues. Revenues and expenses are presented in the consolidated statements of operations, but are not subtotaled by segment. However, this information is available in total and by segment in Note 22, \"Segmented Information,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, regarding reportable segment information. The nearest comparable U.S. GAAP measure is loss from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit) which, in addition to operating (loss) income, includes net investment income, net realized gains, other-than-temporary impairment loss, other income not allocated to segments, general and administrative expenses, amortization of intangible assets, contingent consideration benefit, impairment of asset held for sale, interest expense, foreign exchange losses, net, (gain) loss on change in fair value of debt, loss on disposal of subsidiary, loss on disposal of asset held for sale, loss on deconsolidation of subsidiary and equity in net loss of investee. A reconciliation of segment operating (loss) income to loss from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit) for the year ended December 31, 2015 is presented in Table 1 of the \"Results of Continuing Operations\" section of MD&A.\nIn summary, as reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company's net decrease in cash and cash equivalents during 2015 was $19.5 million.\nThe purpose of liquidity management is to ensure that there is sufficient cash to meet all financial commitments and obligations as they fall due. The liquidity requirements of the Company and its subsidiaries have been met primarily by funds generated from operations, disposal of discontinued operations, investment maturities and income and other returns received on investments. Cash provided from these sources is used primarily for loss and loss adjustment expense payments, debt servicing and other operating expenses. The timing and amount of payments for loss and loss adjustment expenses may differ materially from our provisions for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses, which may create increased liquidity requirements.\nThe length of time a fixed maturity investment may be held in an unrealized loss position may vary based on the opinion of the investment manager and their respective analyses related to valuation and to the various credit risks that may prevent us from recapturing the principal investment. In the case of a fixed maturity investment where the investment manager determines that there is little or no risk of default prior to the maturity of a holding, we would elect to hold the investment in an unrealized loss position until the price recovers or the investment matures. In situations where facts emerge that might increase the risk associated with recapture of principal, the Company may elect to sell a fixed maturity investment at a loss.\nInterest Expense\nEquity in Net Loss of Investee\nInterest expense for 2015 was $5.3 million compared to $5.6 million in 2014. The decrease is attributable to the repayment during June 2015 of the outstanding principal balance on the LROC preferred units due June 30, 2015.\nGain (Loss) on Change in Fair Value of Debt\nInsurance Services\n\nOur equity investments, including warrants, are recorded at fair value using quoted market values based on latest bid prices, where active markets exist, or models based on significant market observable inputs, where no active markets exist. For fixed maturities, we use observable inputs such as quoted prices in inactive markets, quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments, benchmark interest rates, broker quotes and other relevant inputs. We do not have any investments in our portfolio which require us to use unobservable inputs. Any change in the estimated fair value of our investments could impact the amount of unrealized gain or loss we have recorded, which could change the amount we have recorded for our investments and other comprehensive income (loss) on our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe ultimate realization of the deferred income tax asset balance is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the Company's temporary differences reverse and become deductible. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred income tax asset balance will not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is needed, management considers all available positive and negative evidence affecting specific deferred income tax asset balances, including the Company's past and anticipated future performance, the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, and the availability of tax planning strategies.\n\nOn July 21, 2014, 1347 Capital Corp. completed an initial public offering of 4.0 million units at a price to the public of $10.00 per unit for total gross proceeds of $40.0 million. Each unit issued in the initial public offering consists of one share of common stock, one right to receive one-tenth of a share of common stock automatically on the consummation of an initial business combination, and one warrant to acquire one-half of one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per full share of common stock. On July 23, 2014, the option to purchase an additional 0.6 million units that 1347 Capital Corp. had granted to the underwriters for additional gross proceeds of $6.0 million was completed. As a result, 1347 Capital Corp. issued a total of 4.6 million units in its initial public offering, generating total gross proceeds of $46.0 million.\nIn the year-end actuarial review process, an analysis of the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is completed for each insurance subsidiary and IWS. Unpaid deferred cost containment expenses and unpaid adjusting and other expenses, which are components of the provision for loss adjustment expenses, and unpaid losses are each separately analyzed by line of business and by accident year utilizing a wide range of actuarial methods. These unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are further analyzed by looking separately at case reserves, which are specific reserves established for specific claims, and reserves for losses incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\").\nLoss on Deconsolidation of Subsidiary\nContingent Consideration\nThe establishment of an other-than-temporary impairment on an investment requires a number of judgments and estimates. We perform a quarterly analysis of the individual investments to determine if declines in market value are other-than-temporary. The analysis includes some or all of the following procedures, as applicable:\nThe Insurance Underwriting expense ratio was 27.4% in 2015 compared with 29.5% in 2014. The decrease in the expense ratio is primarily due to an overall reduction in general expenses. The Insurance Underwriting expense ratio includes policy fee income of $8.3 million and $8.1 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\n\nFair Value Assumptions for Debt Obligations\nAs a result of these acquisitions, the Company beneficially owned and controlled 2,333,715 units, representing 74.8% of the issued and outstanding LROC preferred units and began consolidating the financial statements of KLROC Trust effective July 23, 2010. In the consolidated financial statements, the par value of the units owned was netted against the liability related to the LROC preferred units due June 30, 2015. At December 31, 2014, the Company's outstanding net obligation was C$15.8 million.\nLoss on Disposal of Subsidiary\n 36 \n \u2022 the debt service pattern of non-investment grade instruments may not reflect future debt service capabilities and may not reflect a company's unknown underlying financial problems.  As a result of the analysis performed by the Company to determine declines in market value that are other-than-temporary, the Company recorded a write down of $0.0 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to fixed maturities for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company did not recognize any impairment related to its investments that was considered other-than-temporary for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nBecause the investments portfolio is comprised of primarily fixed maturity instruments that are usually held to maturity, periodic changes in interest rate levels generally impact our financial results to the extent that the investments are recorded at market value and reinvestment yields are different than the original yields on maturing instruments. During periods of rising interest rates, the market values of the existing fixed maturities will generally decrease. The reverse is true during periods of declining interest rates.\n 35 \nKAI subsequently repurchased and retired most of the originally issued par value. In February 2014, KAI repaid the $14.4 million remaining amount outstanding on its senior unsecured debentures due February 1, 2014.\n\n \u2022 the credit ratings assigned by independent credit rating agencies may be incorrect due to unforeseen or unknown facts related to a company's financial situation; and \nObjective positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for all or a portion of a company's deferred income tax asset balances when significant negative evidence exists. Cumulative losses are the most compelling form of negative evidence considered by management in this determination. To the extent a valuation allowance is established in a period, an expense must be recorded within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2015, the Company maintains a valuation allowance of $283.6 million, $277.1 million of which relates to its U.S. deferred income taxes. The largest component of the U.S. deferred income tax asset balance relates to tax loss carryforwards that have arisen as a result of losses generated from the Company's U.S. operations. Uncertainty over the Company's ability to utilize these losses over the short-term has led the Company to record a valuation allowance.\n\n \u2022 identifying other circumstances which management believes may impact the recoverability of the unrealized loss positions; \n \u2022 determining the necessary provision for declines in market value that are considered other-than-temporary based on the analyses performed; and \nThe Company has an off-balance sheet arrangement related to a guarantee, which is further described in Note 25, \"Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuring 2015, the Company incurred foreign exchange losses, net of $1.2 million compared to $0.4 million in 2014. Foreign exchange losses, net for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were incurred primarily related to conversion of the net Canadian dollar assets of Kingsway Linked Return of Capital Trust (\"KLROC Trust\").\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, the gross provisions for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses for our commercial automobile business were $1.4 million and $4.2 million, respectively. This decrease is due to the continuing voluntary run-offs of Amigo and MCC.\nThe Insurance Services service fee and commission income decreased 6.9% to $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was due to decreased service fee and commission income at IWS. The Insurance Services operating loss was $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with operating income of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in operating loss is primarily related to decreased service fee and commission income at IWS and increased general and administrative expenses at Trinity for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.\nFuture events may result in the valuation allowance being adjusted, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. If sufficient positive evidence were to arise in the future indicating that all or a portion of the deferred income tax assets would meet the more likely than not standard, the valuation allowance would be reversed in the period that such a conclusion was reached.\nFollowing is a list of non-U.S. GAAP measures found throughout this report with their definitions, relationships to U.S. GAAP measures and explanations of their importance to our operations.\nSegment Operating (Loss) Income\n\nIWS is a licensed motor vehicle service agreement company and is a provider of after-market vehicle protection services distributed by credit unions in 26 states to their members.\n1347 Capital Corp. has 24 months from July 21, 2014, the date of the initial public offering, to complete a successful business combination. Had a successful business combination been consummated during 2015, and assuming the December 31, 2015 closing stock price for 1347 Capital Corp. common shares, the Company estimates the increase in its shareholders' equity would have been approximately $5.8 million at December 31, 2015. There can be no assurance that 1347 Capital Corp. will complete a successful business combination. In the event 1347 Capital Corp. does not complete a successful business combination, the Company estimates its shareholders' equity would decrease by approximately $1.8 million.\nWhile net premiums earned is the related U.S. GAAP measure used in the consolidated statements of operations, net premiums written is the component of net premiums earned that measures the difference between gross premiums written and the impact of ceding reinsurance premiums, but without respect to when those premiums will be recognized as actual revenue. We use this measure as an indication of retained or net business volume in Insurance Underwriting.\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment annually as of December 31, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the goodwill is impaired, a fair value-based impairment test would be required. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process that requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation. The first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on valuation techniques, including a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts, and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, which includes the allocated goodwill. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment, if any, by determining an implied fair value of goodwill. The determination of the implied fair value of goodwill of a reporting unit requires management to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. Any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill, which is compared to its corresponding carrying value. For reporting units with a negative book value, qualitative factors are evaluated to determine whether it is necessary to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test. Additional information regarding our goodwill is included in Note 9, \"Goodwill,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInvestment in Investee\nThe Company performs a quarterly analysis of its investment portfolio to determine if declines in market value are other-than-temporary. Further information regarding our detailed analysis and factors considered in establishing an other-than-temporary impairment on an investment is discussed within the \"Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions\" section of MD&A.\nValuation of Fixed Maturities and Equity Investments\nDue to the inherent volatility of equity markets, we believe an equity investment may trade from time to time below its intrinsic value based on historical valuation measures. In these situations, an equity investment may be maintained in an unrealized loss position for different periods of time based on the underlying economic assumptions driving the investment manager's valuation of the holding.\nWe measure derivative financial instruments at fair value. Warrants are recorded at fair value using quoted market values based on latest bid prices, where active markets exist, or models based on significant market observable inputs, where no active markets exist. The performance shares, for which no active market exists, are required to be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Company. Such determination of fair value would require us to develop a model based upon relevant observable market inputs as well as significant unobservable inputs, including developing a sufficiently reliable estimate for an appropriate discount to reflect the illiquidity and unique structure of the security. The Company determined that its model for the performance shares was not sufficiently reliable. As a result, we have assigned a fair value of zero to the performance shares. The fair value of derivative financial instruments is required to be revalued each reporting period, with corresponding changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations, or, in the case of derivative financial instruments that are actively traded, in other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains or losses are recognized upon settlement of the contracts.\nA significant degree of judgment is required to determine amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements for the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses. The process for establishing the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses reflects the uncertainties and significant judgmental factors inherent in predicting future results of both known and unknown loss events. As such, the process is inherently complex and imprecise and estimates are constantly refined. The process of establishing the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses relies on the judgment and opinions of a large number of individuals, including the opinions of the Company's actuaries. Further information regarding estimates used in determining our provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is discussed in the Unpaid Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses\u201d section of Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report and Note 12, \"Unpaid Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTables 6 and 7 present distributions, by line of business, of the provision for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses gross and net of external reinsurance, respectively.\n\nTABLE 9 Cash payments related to contractual obligations projected by period\nSubordinated Debt\nThe gain on change in fair value of debt amounted to $1.5 million in 2015 compared to a loss of $11.0 million in 2014. The 2015 gain is primarily due to a decrease in the fair values of the subordinated debt and LROC preferred units, whereas the 2014 loss is due to an increase in the fair value of the Company's subordinated debt, partially offset by a decrease in the fair value of the LROC preferred units. For information regarding the Company's approach to determining fair value of debt, see Note 23, \"Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAdditional information regarding our intangible assets is included in Note 10, \"Intangible Assets,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n 40 \nDeferred Acquisition Costs\nOn July 14, 2005, KLROC Trust completed its public offering of C$78.0 million through the issuance of 3,120,000 LROC 5% preferred units due June 30, 2015, of which the Company was a promoter. KLROC Trust's net proceeds of the public offering was C$74.1 million.\nThroughout this 2015 Annual Report, we present our operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful, useful and transparent to anyone using this financial information to evaluate our performance. In addition to the U.S. GAAP presentation of net income (loss), we show certain statutory reporting information and other non-U.S. GAAP financial measures that we believe are relevant in managing our business and drawing comparisons to our peers. These measures are segment operating (loss) income, gross premiums written, net premiums written and underwriting ratios.\nEffective March 31, 2014, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, PIH, completed an initial public offering of its common stock. Upon completion of the transaction, the Company maintained a minority ownership interest in the common shares of PIH. As a result of the disposal, the Company recognized a loss of $1.2 million in 2014. See Note 4, \"Disposition, Deconsolidation and Discontinued Operations,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further details.\nAs of December 31 (in thousands of dollars)\n\nThe Company's Insurance Underwriting subsidiaries fund their obligations primarily through premium and investment income and maturities in the investments portfolios. The Company's Insurance Services subsidiaries fund their obligations primarily through service fee and commission income. As a holding company, Kingsway funds its obligations, which primarily consist of interest payments on debt as well as holding company operating expenses, primarily through the sale of subsidiaries and other assets; issuance of debt and equity securities; and receipt of dividends from its non-insurance subsidiaries. On the other hand, the insurance subsidiaries require regulatory approval for the return of capital and, in certain circumstances, prior to the payment of dividends. At December 31, 2015, the U.S. insurance subsidiaries of the Company were restricted from making any dividend payments to the holding company without regulatory approval pursuant to the domiciliary state insurance regulations.\nInformation with respect to development of our provision for prior years' property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is presented in Table 8.\n 42 \n \u2022 identifying all unrealized loss positions that have existed for at least six months; \nInsurance Underwriting\nIntangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Intangible assets with definite useful lives consist of vehicle service agreements in-force (\"VSA in-force\"), database and customer-related relationships. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If circumstances require that a definite-lived intangible asset be tested for possible impairment, we first compare the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that definite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the definite-lived intangible asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.\nGoodwill Recoverability\nTABLE 6 Provision for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses - gross\nItem 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNon-Standard Automobile\nThe Company incurred net realized gains of $1.2 million in 2015 compared to $5.0 million in 2014. The net realized gains in 2015 resulted primarily from the liquidation of limited liability investments in Insurance Underwriting. The net realized gains in 2014 resulted primarily from the liquidation of equity investments in Insurance Underwriting.\nPROPERTY AND CASUALTY UNPAID LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES\nDEBT\nDeferred acquisition costs represent the deferral of expenses that we incur related to successful efforts to acquire new business or renew existing business. Acquisition costs, primarily commissions, premium taxes and underwriting and agency expenses related to issuing insurance policies and vehicle service agreements, are deferred and charged against income ratably over the terms of the related insurance policies and vehicle service agreements. Management regularly reviews the categories of acquisition costs that are deferred and assesses the recoverability of this asset. For Insurance Underwriting, a premium deficiency and a corresponding charge to income is recognized if the sum of the expected losses and loss adjustment expenses, unamortized acquisition costs and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums and anticipated net investment income.\nMarket Risk\nRESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS\nFactors affecting the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses include the continually evolving and changing regulatory and legal environment; actuarial studies; the professional experience and expertise of the Company's claims personnel and independent adjusters retained to handle individual claims; the quality of the data used for projection purposes; existing claims management practices including claims handling and settlement practices; the effect of inflationary trends on future loss settlement costs; court decisions; economic conditions; and public attitudes.\nThe Insurance Underwriting operating loss increased to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to operating income of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in operating loss is primarily attributed to an increase in loss and loss adjustment expenses, partially offset by an increase in net premiums earned and a decrease in general expenses in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nTable 3 below summarizes the fair value by contractual maturities of the fixed maturities portfolio, excluding cash and cash equivalents, at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nThe Company previously placed Amigo and MCC into voluntary run-off in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Each of Amigo and MCC entered into a comprehensive run-off plan which was approved by its respective state of domicile. Kingsway continues to manage Amigo and MCC in a manner consistent with the run-off plans. During the first quarter of 2015, MCC sent a letter of intent to the Illinois Department of Insurance to resume writing private passenger automobile policies in the state of Illinois. MCC began writing these policies on April 1, 2015.\nAs of December 31\n\nINVESTMENTS\n 44 \nDuring 2015, the net cash used in operating activities as reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows was $32.8 million. This use of cash can be explained primarily by the loss from continuing operations of $11.4 million, the decrease in the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses of $8.4 million and decrease in other, net of $20.0 million; offset by the loss on deconsolidation of subsidiary of $4.4 million and the decrease in reinsurance recoverable of $2.2 million. The decrease in other, net of $20.0 million primarily relates to the Company's payment to its Trust Preferred trustees of accrued interest which the Company had been deferring since the first quarter of 2011.\n\nForeign Exchange Losses, Net\nOur Linked Return of Capital (\"LROC\") preferred units due June 30, 2015 and subordinated debt are measured and reported at fair value. The fair value of the LROC preferred units was based on quoted market prices prior to redemption in June 2015, and the fair value of the subordinated debt is calculated by a third-party using a model based on significant market observable inputs. Any change in the estimated fair value of our debt is reflected in the gain or loss on change in fair value of debt we record in the consolidated statements of operations and in the carrying value for our debt on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nAs of December 31 (in thousands of dollars, except for percentages)\nOther Income and Expenses not Allocated to Segments, Net\nTABLE 4 Credit ratings of fixed maturities\n\n 33 \n \u2022 assessing if declines in market value are other-than-temporary for any debt instrument with a non-investment grade credit rating based on the continuity of its debt service record; \nTABLE 8 Increase (decrease) in prior years' provision for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses by line of business and accident year\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company owns 61.0% of the outstanding units of 1347 Investors LLC (\"1347 Investors\"). Because the Company owns more than 50% of the outstanding units, 1347 Investors is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2015. 1347 Investors has an investment in the common stock and private units of 1347 Capital Corp. which is reflected as investment in investee in the consolidated balance sheets. 1347 Capital Corp. was formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities.\nContingent consideration benefit was $1.1 million in 2015 compared to $2.2 million in 2014. Contingent consideration liabilities resulting from the acquisitions of IWS and Trinity were estimated at their respective acquisition dates using valuation models designed to estimate the probability of such contingent payments based on various assumptions. The valuation models assume certain achievement of targets, discount rates related to riskiness of the projections used and the time value of money to calculate the net present value of future consideration payments. Each reporting period, the Company reevaluates its contingent consideration liabilities and, if significant, makes adjustments to the recorded liabilities. As a result of the analyses performed in 2015 and 2014, the Company decreased contingent consideration liabilities by $1.5 million and $3.0 million, respectively, during the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2014, resulting in a total liability of $2.0 million and $3.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015 and 2014, which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 23, \"Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further details.\nThe provision for income taxes is calculated based on the expected tax treatment of transactions recorded in our consolidated financial statements. In determining our provision for income taxes, we interpret tax legislation in a variety of jurisdictions and make assumptions about the expected timing of the reversal of deferred income tax assets and liabilities and the valuation of deferred income taxes.\nNet Premiums Written\nFor the years ended December 31 (in thousands of dollars)\nThe net movements in prior years' provisions for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance, was an increase of $0.6 million and a decrease of $5.1 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Table 8 identifies the relative contribution of the increases (decreases) in the provisions for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses attributable to the respective lines of business and accident years.\n\nOur reinsurance subsidiary, which is domiciled in Barbados, is required by the regulator in Barbados to maintain minimum capital levels. As of December 31, 2015, the capital maintained by Kingsway Reinsurance Corporation was in excess of the regulatory capital requirements in Barbados.\nTable 2 below summarizes the carrying value of investments, including cash and cash equivalents, at the dates indicated.\n\nThe Insurance Underwriting loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for 2015 was 74.1% compared to 69.7% in 2014. The increase in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is primarily attributable to lower favorable development related to property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses at Amigo and MCC in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the continuing voluntary run-offs of Amigo and MCC.\nAs of December 31, 2015 (in thousands of dollars)\nMarket risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in interest or currency exchange rates and equity prices. Given our U.S. operations typically invest in U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturity instruments, our primary market risk exposures in the investments portfolio are to changes in interest rates.\n\nEffective April 1, 2015, the Company closed on the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary, Assigned Risk Solutions Ltd. (\"ARS\"). As a result, ARS has been classified as discontinued operations and the results of their operations are reported separately for all periods presented. Prior to the transaction, ARS was included in the Insurance Services segment. As a result of classifying ARS as a discontinued operation, all segmented information has been restated to exclude ARS from the Insurance Services segment.\nDerivative financial instruments include investments in warrants and performance shares issued to the Company under various performance share grant agreements. Refer to Note 24, \"Related Party Transactions,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further details regarding the performance shares. Warrants are classified as equity investments in the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates and their underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in estimates are recorded in the accounting period in which they are determined. The critical accounting estimates and assumptions in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses; valuation of fixed maturities and equity investments; valuation of deferred income taxes; impairment assessment of intangible assets; goodwill recoverability; deferred acquisition costs; fair value assumptions for performance shares; fair value assumptions for debt obligations; and contingent consideration.\n 34 \nOn August 18, 2014, the Company announced its intention to redeem its outstanding series A warrants, which were issued pursuant to the September 2013 rights offering. Holders of series A warrants could exercise their outstanding series A warrants at $4.50 per common share. Any series A warrants that remained unexercised after September 19, 2014 were automatically redeemed by the Company at the redemption price of $0.25 per series A warrant. During 2014, series A warrants to purchase 3,279,945 shares of common stock were exercised, resulting in cash proceeds of $14.8 million. The 845 series A warrants that remained unexercised were redeemed by the Company at the redemption price of $0.25.\nNON U.S.-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred a loss from continuing operations of $11.4 million ($0.60 per diluted share) compared to $14.7 million ($0.95 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2014. The loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily attributable to operating loss in Insurance Underwriting and Insurance Services, income and expenses not allocated to segments, interest expense, and loss on deconsolidation of subsidiary, partially offset by net investment income and gain on change in fair value of debt. The loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 is attributable to income and expenses not allocated to segments, impairment of asset held for sale, interest expense, loss on change in fair value of debt and loss on disposal of subsidiary, partially offset by net realized gains, contingent consideration benefit and operating income in Insurance Services and Insurance

holding company that operates in the property and casualty insurance business through two segments: Insurance Underwriting and Insurance Services.\n\nResults of Continuing Operations\n- Loss from continuing operations was $11.4 million in 2015 compared to $14.7 million in 2014. The loss in 2015 was driven by operating losses in the business segments, interest expense, and a loss on deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This was partially offset by investment income and a gain on change in fair value of debt.\n\n- Insurance Underwriting had an operating loss of $1.1 million in 2015 compared to income of $1.3 million in 2014. The increase in operating loss was primarily due to higher loss and loss adjustment expenses.\n\n- Insurance Services had an operating loss of $0.6 million in 2015 compared to income of $0.2 million in 2014. The increase in operating loss was driven by lower service fee income and higher expenses.\n\nInvestments\n- Total investments, including cash, were $159.4 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $158.3 million at December 31, 2014.  \n\n- Net investment income was $2.9 million in 2015 compared to $1.6 million in 2014, primarily due to higher income from limited liability investments.\n\nUnpaid Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses \n- Critical accounting estimate involving judgments and estimates. Key judgments relate to claims projections, effects of external factors, and actuarial assumptions.\n\n- Decreased by $8.4 million during 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the run-off status of certain subsidiaries.\n\nDebt\n- Total debt obligations were $55.6 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $56.2 million at December 31, 2014.\n\nLiquididity and Capital Resources\n- Holding company obligations funded through subsidiary dividends, debt and equity issuances. Insurance subsidiaries fund obligations through premiums and investment income.\n\n- Cash and investments are sufficient to cover expected payments for losses and expenses in the near term."}
