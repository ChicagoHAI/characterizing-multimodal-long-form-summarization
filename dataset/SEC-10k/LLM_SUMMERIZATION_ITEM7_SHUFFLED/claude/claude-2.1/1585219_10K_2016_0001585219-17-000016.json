MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data\u201d above and our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report. Also see Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\u201d preceding Part I.\nOverview\nWe were formed on August 22, 2013, as a Maryland corporation that has elected to qualify as a REIT. We invest in and manage a diverse portfolio of multifamily properties located in targeted markets throughout the United States. In addition to our focus on multifamily properties, we may also make selective strategic acquisitions of other types of commercial properties. We may also acquire or originate mortgage, mezzanine, bridge and other real estate loans and equity securities of other real estate companies.\nOn December 30, 2013, we commenced our initial public offering of up to 66,666,667 shares of common stock at an initial price of $15.00 per share and up to 7,017,544 shares of common stock pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan at an initial price of $14.25 per share. On March 24, 2016, we terminated our initial public offering. As of March 24, 2016, we had sold 48,625,651 shares of common stock for gross offering proceeds of $724,849,631, including 1,011,561 shares of common stock issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan for gross offering proceeds of $14,414,752. Following the termination of our initial public offering, we have continued to offer shares of our common stock pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. As of December 31, 2016, we had sold 49,835,344 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $742,287,907, including 2,221,317 shares of common stock issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan for gross offering proceeds of $31,853,028.\nOn March 24, 2016, our board of directors determined an estimated value per share of our common stock of $14.46 as of December 31, 2015. On February 14, 2017, our board of directors determined an estimated value per share of our common stock of $14.85 as of December 31, 2016. For more information on the determination of the estimated value per share of our common stock, see Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Purchases of Equity Securities - Estimated Value Per Share.\u201d In connection with the determination of our estimated value per share, on March 24, 2016 and on February 14, 2017, our board of directors increased the purchase price of shares offered pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan to $14.85 and $14.46, effective March 1, 2017 and May 1, 2016, respectively. In the future, our board of directors may, in its sole discretion and from time to time, change the price at which we offer shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan to reflect changes in our estimated value per share and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.\nSubject to certain restrictions and limitations, our advisor manages our day-to-day operations and our portfolio of properties and real estate-related assets. Our advisor sources and presents investment opportunities to our board of directors. Our advisor also provides investment management, marketing, investor relations and other administrative services on our behalf.\nSubstantially all of our business is conducted through our operating partnership. We are the sole general partner of our operating partnership and one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is the only limited partner of our operating partnership. As we accepted subscriptions for shares of common stock, we transferred substantially all of the net proceeds of the initial public offering to our operating partnership as a capital contribution. The limited partnership agreement of our operating partnership provides that our operating partnership will be operated in a manner that will enable us to (1) satisfy the requirements for being classified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, (2) avoid any federal income or excise tax liability and (3) ensure that our operating partnership will not be classified as a publicly traded partnership\u201d for purposes of Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code, which classification could result in our operating partnership being taxed as a corporation, rather than as a disregarded entity. In addition to the administrative and operating costs and expenses incurred by our operating partnership in acquiring and operating our investments, our operating partnership will pay all of our administrative costs and expenses, and such expenses will be treated as expenses of our operating partnership.\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent that we distribute qualifying dividends to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year in which qualification is lost, unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Failing to qualify as a REIT could materially and adversely affect our net income and results of operations.\nMarket Outlook\nDuring times of economic downturn, market conditions could negatively impact the multifamily real estate sector, resulting in lower occupancy, lower rental rates and declining values. The economy in the United States has improved; however, there is no assurance that economic conditions will continue to improve or will not worsen in the future. We believe we currently have unique investment opportunities, particularly in the multifamily sector. Home ownership rates are the lowest they have been since 1967. Demographic and economic factors favor the flexibility of rental housing and discourage the potential financial burden associated with home ownership. Additionally, Millennials and Baby Boomers, the two largest demographic groups comprising roughly half of the total population in the United States, are increasingly choosing rental housing over home ownership. Our plan is to provide rental housing for these generational groups as they age. Millennials are getting married and having children later and are choosing to live in apartment communities until their mid-30s. Today, 30% of Millennials are still living with their parents or are still in school. When they get a job, Millennials will likely rent moderate income apartments based upon an average income of $35,000 to $55,000. We believe these factors will continue to contribute to the demand for multifamily housing.\nOur Real Estate Portfolio\nAs of December 31, 2016, we owned the 34 multifamily apartment communities

our policies described in this annual report, including policies regarding our investments, leverage and conflicts of interest, and determined that the policies are in the best interests of our stockholders.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe use secured borrowings, and intend to use in the future secured and unsecured borrowings. At December 31, 2016, our debt was approximately 58% of the value of our properties, as determined by an independent third-party appraiser. Going forward, we expect that our borrowings will be approximately 55% to 60% of the value of our properties (after debt amortization) and other real estate-related assets. For valuation purposes, the value of a property will equal the value determined by an independent qualified valuation expert. Under our charter, we are prohibited from borrowing in excess of 300% of the value of our net assets, which generally approximates to 75% of the aggregate cost of our assets, though we may exceed this limit only under certain circumstances.\nIn addition to making investments in accordance with our investment objectives, we use our capital resources to make certain payments to our advisor and its affiliates. During our organization and offering stage, we made payments to the dealer manager for sales commissions and the dealer manager fees and payments to our advisor for reimbursement of certain organization and offering expenses. Currently, during our operating stage, we make payments to our advisor in connection with the acquisition of investments, the management of our assets and costs incurred by our advisor in providing services to us.\nOur principal demand for funds will be to fund value-enhancement and other capital improvement projects, to pay operating expenses and interest on our outstanding indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. Over time, we intend to generally fund our cash needs, other than asset acquisitions, from operations. Otherwise, we expect that our principal sources of working capital will include:\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>current unrestricted cash balance, which was $26,768,318 as of December 31, 2016;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>various forms of secured and unsecured financing;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>borrowings under master repurchase agreements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>equity capital from joint venture partners; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>proceeds from our distribution reinvestment plan.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Over the short term, we believe that our sources of capital, specifically our cash balances, cash flow from operations, our ability to raise equity capital from joint venture partners and our ability to obtain various forms of secured and unsecured financing, including financing pursuant to our credit facility and line of credit each described below, will be adequate to meet our liquidity requirements and capital commitments.\nOver the longer term, in addition to the same sources of capital we will rely on to meet our short-term liquidity requirements, we may also conduct additional public or private offerings of our securities. We expect these resources will be adequate to fund our operating activities, debt service and distributions, and will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operating activities as well as providing capital for investment in future development and other joint ventures along with potential forward purchase commitments.\nOn August 26, 2015, we entered into a revolving credit facility, or the credit facility, with PNC Bank, National Association or PNC Bank, in an amount not to exceed $200,000,000, which provides for advances to purchase properties or refinance existing properties from time to time (subject to certain debt service and loan to value requirements). The credit facility has a maturity date of September 1, 2020, subject to extension. The maximum amount that may be drawn under the credit facility may be increased up to $350,000,000 at any time during the period from January 1, 2016 to 12 months prior to the maturity date. Advances made under the credit facility will be secured by the property for which such advances are used. As of December 31, 2016, $186,300,000 was outstanding on our credit facility. Interest on the outstanding principal balances of advances accrue at the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus (1) the servicing spread of 0.05% and (2) the net spread, based on the debt service coverage ratio, of between 1.80% and 2.10%, as further described in the applicable notes. Monthly interest payments are due and payable on the first day of each month until the maturity date. The entire outstanding principal balance and any accrued and unpaid interest on all advances are due and payable in full on the maturity date. For additional information on our credit facility, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report.\nOn May 18, 2016, we entered into a secured revolving line of credit facility, or the line of credit, with PNC Bank in an amount not to exceed $65,000,000. The line of credit provides for advances solely for the purpose of financing the costs in connection with acquisitions and development of real estate projects and for general corporate purposes (subject to certain debt\nservice and loan to value requirements). The line of credit has a maturity date of May 17, 2019, subject to extension, as further described in the loan agreement entered into by certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries with PNC Bank in connection with the acquisition of the Landings of Brentwood property. As of December 31, 2016, $35,000,000 was outstanding on our line of credit. We have the option to select the interest rate in respect of the outstanding unpaid principal amount of the line of credit loans from the following options (1) the sum of the Base Rate (as defined in the loan agreement) plus 0.60% or (2) a rate per annum fixed for the applicable LIBOR Interest Period (as defined in the loan agreement) equal to the sum of LIBOR plus 1.60%. Monthly interest payments are due and payable in arrears on the first day of each month until the line of credit maturity date. The entire outstanding principal balance and any accrued and unpaid interest on the line of credit loans are due and payable in full on the line of credit maturity date. For additional information on our Line of Credit, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report. We continue to evaluate possible other sources of capital, including, without limitation, entering into additional credit facilities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such financing on favorable terms, if at all.\nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nWe commenced real estate operations with the acquisition of our first multifamily property on May 22, 2014. As of December 31, 2016, we owned 34 multifamily properties. During the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $38,939,853 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $3,258,965 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The change in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to increases in depreciation and amortization and restricted cash partially offset by a decrease in net loss, amounts due to affiliates and accounts payable and accrued liabilities associated with 34 multifamily properties owned as of December 31, 2016, compared to the 30 multifamily properties owned as of December 31, 2015. We expect to continue to generate cash flows from operations as we stabilize the operations of our property portfolio and complete our value-enhancement program.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $269,344,362 compared to $910,962,748 during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of our acquisition of four multifamily properties during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 23 acquisitions of multifamily properties during the year ended December 31, 2015. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of the following:\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$210,030,200 of cash used related to the acquisition of four multifamily properties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$53,334,756 of cash used for improvements to real estate investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$7,092,300 of cash used for deposits for potential real estate investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$570,108 of cash provided by restricted cash accounts related to replacement reserves;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$116,100 of cash used to purchase interest rate cap agreements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$658,886 of cash provided by proceeds from insurance claims.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Cash Flows from Financing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $225,786,450 compared to $917,012,264 during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities is due primarily to the decrease in proceeds from issuance of mortgage notes payable, borrowings from credit facilities and issuance of common stock from $404,655,500, $186,300,000 and $382,566,638, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2015 to $41,850,000, $35,000,000 and $193,953,605, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2016.

We believe that the careful use of borrowings will help us achieve our diversification goals and potentially enhance the returns on our investments. At December 31, 2016, our debt was approximately 58% of the value of our properties, as determined by an independent third-party appraiser. Going forward, we expect that our borrowings will be approximately 55% to 60% of the value of our properties (after debt amortization) and other real estate-related assets. For valuation purposes, the value of a property will equal the value determined by an independent third-party appraiser or qualified independent valuation expert. Under our charter, we are prohibited from borrowing in excess of 300% of our net assets, which generally approximates to 75% of the aggregate cost of our assets unless such excess is approved by a majority of the independent directors and disclosed to stockholders, along with a justification for such excess, in our next quarterly report. In such event, we will monitor our debt levels and take action to reduce any such excess as practicable. Our aggregate borrowings are reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly. As of December 31, 2016, our aggregate borrowings were not in excess of 300% of the value of our net assets.\nIn addition to using our capital resources for investing purposes and meeting our debt obligations, we expect to use our capital resources to make certain payments to our advisor. We expect to make payments to our advisor in connection with the management of our asset portfolio and costs incurred by our advisor in providing services to us.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had indebtedness totaling an aggregate principal amount of $971,761,151, including the net discount on a note payable of $2,630,822 and the net deferred financing costs of $5,534,913.

The ability to compare one period to another is significantly affected by acquisitions completed during those periods in addition to the implementation of our value-enhancement strategy. As of December 31, 2016, we owned 34 multifamily properties compared to 30 multifamily properties at December 31, 2015. The increase in our property portfolio is the primary cause of the increases in operating income and expenses, as further discussed below.\nOur results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are not indicative of those expected in future periods. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had not yet invested all of the proceeds from our initial public offering and therefore increased our borrowings and made acquisitions during the period, which had a significant impact on our future results of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had deployed the remaining offering proceeds and continued to perform value-enhancements projects, which had a significant impact on our results of operations. In general, we expect that our revenues and expenses related to our portfolio will increase in future periods as a result of organic rent increases and anticipated value-enhancement projects.\nTo provide additional insight into our operating results, we are also providing a detailed analysis of same-store versus non-same-store NOI. For more information on NOI and a reconciliation of NOI (a non-GAAP financial measure) to net loss, see -Net Operating Income.\u201d\nConsolidated Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nThe following table summarizes the consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144,010,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,449,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,560,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating, maintenance and management\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35,644,845\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,480,708\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17,164,137\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate taxes and insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20,836,003\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,337,432\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,498,571\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fees to affiliates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24,629,873\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26,301,919\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,672,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(67,991,543\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42,438,760\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25,552,783\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26,060,155\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,275,604\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,784,551\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,848,801\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,739,688\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,109,113\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,681,768\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,569,766\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,887,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(74\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(37,682,474\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(50,694,124\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,011,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NOI(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,592,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,110,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,482,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,309,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,255,364\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,564,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>467\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MFFO(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,566,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,530,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,036,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure used by investors and our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties and to determine trends in earnings.

In an effort to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate assets the Board of Governors of NAREIT established the measurement tool of FFO.

Additionally, we use MFFO, as defined by the Investment Program Association, as a supplemental measure to evaluate our operating performance. MFFO is\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nbased on FFO but includes certain adjustments we believe are necessary due to changes in accounting and reporting under GAAP since the establishment of FFO. Neither FFO nor MFFO should be considered as alternatives to net loss or other measurements under GAAP as indicators of our operating performance, nor should they be considered as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities or other measurements under GAAP as indicators of liquidity. For additional information on how we calculate FFO and MFFO and a reconciliation of FFO and MFFO to net loss, see -Funds From Operations and Modified Funds From Operations.\u201d\nNet loss\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we had a net loss of $37,682,474 compared to $50,694,124 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net loss of $13,011,650 over the comparable prior year period was primarily due to the increase in total revenues of $75,560,761, the decrease in acquisition costs of $4,887,998 and the decrease in fees to affiliates of $1,672,046, partially offset by the increase in operating, maintenance and management expenses of $17,164,137, the increase in real estate taxes and insurance of $11,498,571, the increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $25,552,783, the increase in interest expense of $12,784,551 and the increase in general and administrative expenses of $2,109,113. The increase in these expenses was primarily due to the increase in our property portfolio from 30 multifamily properties as of December 31, 2015 to 34 multifamily properties as of December 31, 2016.\nTotal revenues\nTotal revenues were $144,010,514 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $68,449,753 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $75,560,761 was primarily due to operating 34 multifamily properties at December 31, 2016 compared to 30 multifamily properties at December 31, 2015. Additionally, our total units increased by 1,743 from 9,858 at December 31, 2015 to 11,601 at December 31, 2016. Average monthly rents per unit increased from $1,037 as of December 31, 2015 to $1,102 as of December 31, 2016. We expect rental income and tenant reimbursements to increase in future periods as a result of ordinary monthly rent increases, improved occupancy and the implementation of our value-enhancement strategy.\nOperating, maintenance and management expenses\nOperating, maintenance and management expenses were $35,644,845 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $18,480,708 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $17,164,137 was primarily due to operating 34 multifamily properties as of December 31, 2016 compared to 30 multifamily properties as of December 31, 2015. We expect that these amounts will decrease as a percentage of total revenues as we implement operational efficiencies at our multifamily properties.\nReal estate taxes and insurance\nReal estate taxes and insurance expenses were $20,836,003 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $9,337,432 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $11,498,571 was due to the acquisition of four multifamily properties since December 31, 2015 and the continuing operation of the properties owned as of December 31, 2015. We expect these amounts may increase in future periods as a result of municipal property tax rate increases as well as increases in the assessed value of our property portfolio.\nFees to affiliates\nFees to affiliates were $24,629,873 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $26,301,919 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease of $1,672,046 was primarily due to the decrease in acquisition fees and loan coordination fees as a result of the acquisition of four multifamily properties during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the acquisition of 23 multifamily properties during the year ended December 31, 2015, partially offset by an increase in investment management and property management fees as a result of the growth of our portfolio. We expect fees to affiliates related to the on-going management of our real estate portfolio to increase in future periods as a result of increased property management fees from anticipated increases in future rental income. We expect fees to affiliates related to initial acquisition and financing activities to decrease in future periods as a result of the termination of the initial public offering and the decrease in anticipated future acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related investments.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses were $67,991,543 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $42,438,760 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $25,552,783 was primarily due to the net increase in depreciable and amortizable assets of $263,656,918 since December 31, 2015. We expect these amounts to increase slightly in future periods as a result of anticipated future enhancements to our real estate portfolio.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $26,060,155 compared to $13,275,604 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $12,784,551 was primarily due to the increase in the notes payable, net balance of $120,995,126 since December 31, 2015 due to financing incurred in connection with the acquisition of four multifamily properties since December 31, 2015. Included in interest expense is the amortization of deferred financing costs of $937,075 and $419,743, net, unrealized loss on derivative instruments of $270,222 and $2,554,041, amortization of loan discount of $90,718 and $0 and credit facility commitment fees of $65,302 and $30,254 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our interest expense in future periods will vary based on our level of future borrowings, which will depend on the availability and cost of debt financing and the opportunity to acquire real estate and real estate-related investments meeting our investment objectives.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $4,848,801 compared to $2,739,688 for the year ended December 31, 2015. These general and administrative costs consisted primarily of legal fees, insurance premiums, audit fees, other professional fees and independent director compensation. The increase of $2,109,113 was primarily due to the acquisition of four multifamily properties since December 31, 2015 and the continuing operation of the properties owned as of December 31, 2015. We expect general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of total revenues.\nAcquisition costs\nAcquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $1,681,768 compared to $6,569,766 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease of $4,887,998 was primarily due to the acquisition of four multifamily properties with an aggregate contract purchase price of $264,222,500 during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the acquisition of 23 multifamily properties with an aggregate contract purchase price of $960,595,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015. We do not expect to incur significant acquisition costs in future periods as we have invested all of the proceeds from our initial public offering.\nConsolidated Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nThe following table summarizes the consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,449,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,255,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61,194,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>843\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating, maintenance and management\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,480,708\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,793,769\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,686,939\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>930\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate taxes and insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,337,432\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,011,078\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,326,354\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>824\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fees to affiliates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26,301,919\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,678,614\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20,623,305\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>363\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42,438,760\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,316,510\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(37,122,250\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>698\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,275,604\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,589,848\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,685,756\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>735\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,739,688\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,670,171\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,069,517\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,569,766\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,035,731\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,534,035\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>223\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(50,694,124\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,840,455\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(38,853,669\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>328\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NOI(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,110,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,169,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,940,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>814\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,255,364\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,523,945\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,731,419\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MFFO(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,530,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,013,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,516,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,630\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>For information on how we calculate NOI and a reconciliation of NOI to net loss, see -Net Operating Income.\u201d\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>For information on how we calculate FFO and MFFO and a reconciliation of FFO and MFFO to net loss, see -Funds From Operations and Modified Funds From Operations.\u201d\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet loss\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we had a net loss of $50,694,124 compared to $11,840,455 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in net loss of $38,853,669 over the comparable prior year period was primarily due to the increase in operating, maintenance and management expenses of $16,686,939, the increase in real estate taxes and insurance of $8,326,354, the increase in fees to affiliates of $20,623,305, the increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $37,122,250, the increase in interest expense of $11,685,756, the increase in general and administrative expenses of $1,069,517 and the increase in acquisition costs of $4,534,035, partially offset by the increase in total revenues of $61,194,487.

The increase of $4,534,035 was due primarily to the acquisition of 23 multifamily properties with an aggregate contract purchase price of $960,595,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the acquisition of seven multifamily properties with an aggregate contract purchase price of $274,564,250 during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nProperty Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nFor purposes of evaluating comparative operating performance for the year, we categorize our properties as same-store\u201d or non-same-store.\u201d A same-store\u201d property is a property that was owned at January 1, 2015. A non-same-store\u201d property is a property that was acquired, placed into service or disposed of after January 1, 2015. As of December 31, 2016, seven properties were categorized as same-store properties.\nThe following table presents the same-store and non-same-store results from operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same-store properties:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,300,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,375,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,924,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,360,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,735,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>624,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,939,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,640,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,299,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-same-store properties:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63,652,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,470,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,182,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net operating income(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,592,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,110,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,482,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>See -Net Operating Income\u201d below for a reconciliation of NOI to net loss.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Net Operating Income\nSame-store net operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $17,939,724 compared to $16,640,171 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The 7.8% increase in same-store net operating income was a result of a 6.6% increase in same-store rental revenues offset by a 4.9% increase in same-store operating expenses.\nRevenues\nSame-store revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $31,300,101 compared to $29,375,557 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The 6.6% increase in same-store revenues was primarily due to average rent increases at the same-store properties from $997 as of December 31, 2015 to $1,055 as of December 31, 2016, as a result of ordinary monthly rent increases and the completion of value-enhancement projects.\nOperating Expenses\nSame-store operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $13,360,377 compared to $12,735,386 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in same-store operating expenses was primarily attributable to a net increase in property taxes across the same-store properties.\nNet Operating Income\nNOI is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. NOI is used by investors and our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties, to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of our properties as it is not affected by (1) the cost of funds, (2) acquisition costs, (3) non-operating fees to affiliates, (4) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP or (5) general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses that are specific to us. The cost of funds is eliminated from net income (loss) because it is specific to our particular financing capabilities and constraints. The cost of funds is also eliminated because it is dependent on historical interest rates and other costs of capital as well as past decisions made by us regarding the appropriate mix of capital which may have changed or may change in the future. Acquisition costs and non-operating fees to affiliates are eliminated because they do not reflect continuing operating costs of the property owner.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets are eliminated because they may not accurately represent the actual change in value in our multifamily properties that result from use of the properties or changes in market conditions. While certain aspects of real property do decline in value over time in a manner that is reasonably captured by depreciation and amortization, the value of the properties as a whole have historically increased or decreased as a result of changes in overall economic conditions instead of from actual use of the property or the passage of time. Gains and losses from the sale of real property vary from property to property and are affected by market conditions at the time of sale which will usually change from period to period. These gains and losses can create distortions when comparing one period to another or when comparing our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies that have not made similarly timed purchases or sales. We believe that eliminating these costs from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating our properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.\nHowever, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes general and administrative costs, interest expense, interest income and other expense, acquisition costs, certain fees to affiliates, depreciation and amortization expense and gains or losses from the sale of properties, and other gains and losses as stipulated by GAAP, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which are significant economic costs. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of net income which further limits its usefulness.\nNOI is a measure of the operating performance of our properties but does not measure our performance as a whole. NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income (loss) as computed in accordance with GAAP. This measure should be analyzed in conjunction with net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP and discussions elsewhere in -Results of Operations\u201d regarding the components of net income (loss) that are eliminated in the calculation of NOI. Other companies may use different methods for calculating NOI or similarly entitled measures and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies that do not define the measure exactly as we do.\nThe following is a reconciliation of our NOI to net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 computed in accordance with GAAP:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Three Months Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,579,364\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17,510,929\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(37,682,474\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(50,694,124\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,840,455\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fees to affiliates(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,179,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,936,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,401,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,730,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,396,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,075,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,875,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,991,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,438,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,316,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,776,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,337,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,060,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,275,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,589,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,309,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>721,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,848,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,739,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,670,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,907,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,681,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,569,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,035,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other gains and losses(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(56,516\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,512\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(709,116\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,714,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,253,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,592,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,110,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,169,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Fees to affiliates for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016 exclude property management fees of $1,139,958 and $4,140,513 and other fees of $228,061 and $1,087,408, respectively, that are included in NOI.

The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. FFO is not equivalent to our net income (loss) as determined under GAAP.\nWe define FFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004, or the White Paper. The White Paper defines FFO as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property and non-cash impairment charges of real estate related investments, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. In particular, we believe it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges, as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations and assessments regarding general market conditions which can change over time. An asset will only be evaluated for impairment if certain impairment indications exist and if the carrying, or book value, exceeds the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows (including net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP) from such asset. Investors should note, however, that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows, are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and the relatively limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT's policy described above.\nThe historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, especially if such assets are not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances and/or as requested or required by lessees for operational purposes in order to maintain the value disclosed. We believe that since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation may be less informative. Historical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate related depreciation and amortization, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income. However, FFO, and MFFO as described below, should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP FFO and MFFO measures and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO.\nChanges in the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP (for acquisition fees and expenses from a capitalization/depreciation model to an expensed-as-incurred model) that were put into effect in 2009 and other changes to GAAP accounting for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition fees and expenses for all industries as items that are expensed under GAAP, that are typically accounted for as operating expenses. Management believes these fees and expenses do not affect our overall long-term operating performance. Publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation. While other start-up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, we believe that public, non-listed REITs, like us, are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after acquisition activity ceases. Our board of directors will determine to pursue a liquidity event when it believes that the then-current market conditions are favorable. However, our board of directors does not anticipate evaluating a liquidity event (i.e., listing of our common stock on a national exchange, a merger or sale of our company or another similar transaction) until five years after the completion of our offering stage. Thus, as a limited life REIT, we will not continuously purchase assets and will have a limited life.\nDue to the above factors and other unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the Investment Program Association, or IPA, an industry trade group, has standardized a measure known as MFFO, which the IPA has recommended as\na supplemental measure for publicly registered non-listed REITs and which we believe to be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a public, non-listed REIT having the characteristics described above. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate with a limited life and targeted exit strategy, as currently intended. We believe that, because MFFO excludes costs that we consider more reflective of investing activities and other non-operating items included in FFO and also excludes acquisition fees and expenses that affect our operations only in periods in which properties are acquired, MFFO can provide, on a going forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of our operating performance after the period in which we are acquiring our properties and once our portfolio is in place. By providing MFFO, we believe we are presenting useful information that assists investors and analysts to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our offering has been completed and our properties have been acquired. We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the non-listed REIT industry. Further, we believe MFFO is useful in comparing the sustainability of our operating performance after our offering and acquisitions are completed with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies that are not as involved in acquisition activities. Investors are cautioned that MFFO should only be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our offering has been completed and properties have been acquired, as it excludes acquisition costs that have a negative effect on our operating performance during the periods in which properties are acquired.\nWe define MFFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, consistent with the IPA's Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations, or the Practice Guideline, issued by the IPA in November 2010. The Practice Guideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for the following items, as applicable, included in the determination of GAAP net income: acquisition fees and expenses; amounts relating to deferred rent receivables and amortization of above and below market leases and liabilities (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to a cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments); accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income; nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. The accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments, nonrecurring unrealized gains and losses on hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings, unrealized gains and losses resulting from consolidations, as well as other listed cash flow adjustments are adjustments made to net income in calculating the cash flows provided by operating activities and, in some cases, reflect gains or losses which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized. While we rely on our Advisor for managing interest rate, hedge and foreign exchange risk, we do not retain an outside consultant to review all our hedging agreements. Inasmuch as interest rate hedges are not a fundamental part of our operations, we believe it is appropriate to exclude such non-recurring gains and losses in calculating MFFO, as such gains and losses are not reflective of on-going operations.\nOur MFFO calculation complies with the IPA's Practice Guideline described above. In calculating MFFO, we exclude acquisition related expenses, amortization of above and below market leases, fair value adjustments of derivative financial instruments, deferred rent receivables and the adjustments of such items related to noncontrolling interests. Under GAAP, acquisition fees and expenses are characterized as operating expenses in determining operating net income. These expenses are paid in cash by us. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property. In the event that proceeds from our offerings of shares are not available to fund our reimbursement of acquisition fees and expenses incurred by our advisor, such fees and expenses will need to be reimbursed to our advisor from other sources, including debt, operational earnings or cash flow, net proceeds from the sale of properties, or from ancillary cash flows. The acquisition of properties, and the corresponding acquisition fees and expenses, is the key operational feature of our business plan to generate operational income and cash flow to fund distributions to our stockholders. Further, under GAAP, certain contemplated non-cash fair value and other non-cash adjustments are considered operating non-cash adjustments to net income in determining cash flow from operating activities. In addition, we view fair value adjustments of derivatives and gains and losses from dispositions of assets as non-recurring items or items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized, and which are not reflective of on-going operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance.\nOur management uses MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate MFFO in order to evaluate our performance against other public, non-listed REITs which have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies shortly thereafter. As noted above, MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate in this manner. We believe that our use of MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate\nMFFO allow us to present our performance in a manner that reflects certain characteristics that are unique to public, non-listed REITs, such as their limited life, limited and defined acquisition period and targeted exit strategy, and hence that the use of such measures is useful to investors. By excluding expensed acquisition costs, the use of MFFO provides information consistent with management's analysis of the operating performance of the properties. Additionally, fair value adjustments, which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance. By excluding such changes that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gains or losses, we believe MFFO provides useful supplemental information.\nPresentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors as they compare the operating performance to that of other public, non-listed REITs, although it should be noted that not all public, non-listed REITs calculate FFO and MFFO the same way, so comparisons with other public, non-listed REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with GAAP measurements as an indication of our performance. MFFO has limitations as a performance measure in an offering such as ours where the price of a share of common stock is a stated value and there is no regular net asset value determinations during the offering stage and for a period thereafter. MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and net asset value is disclosed. MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating net asset value because impairments are taken into account in determining net asset value but not in determining MFFO.\nNeither the SEC, NAREIT nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and in response to such standardization we may have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO accordingly.\nOur calculation of FFO and MFFO is presented in the following table for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of net loss to MFFO:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(37,682,474\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(50,694,124\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,840,455\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Depreciation of real estate assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,857,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,291,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,206,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Amortization of lease-related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,134,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,146,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,110,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,309,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,255,364\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,523,945\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Acquisition fees and expenses (1)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,987,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,231,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,959,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Unrealized loss on derivative instruments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>270,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,554,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>578,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MFFO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,566,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,530,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,013,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO per share - basic and diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.38\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.61\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MFFO per share - basic and diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss per common share - basic and diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.80\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.33\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.74\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average number of common shares outstanding, basic and diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,092,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,753,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,495,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>By excluding expensed acquisition costs, management believes MFFO provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management's analysis of the investing and operating performance of our properties.

The acquisition of properties, and the corresponding acquisition fees and expenses, is the key operational feature of our business plan to generate operational income and cash flow to fund distributions to its stockholders.\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Acquisition fees and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 include acquisition fees of $2,766,209, $10,067,980 and $2,954,149 and loan coordination fees of $1,539,500, $6,593,644 and $1,969,306, respectively, that are recorded in fees to affiliates in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

In an inflationary environment, this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Short-term leases generally will minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation, although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore will expose us to the effects of a decline in market rents. In a deflationary rent environment, we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter term leases.\nWith respect to other commercial properties, we expect in the future to include provisions in our leases designed to protect us from the impact of inflation. These provisions include reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements, or in some cases annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain allowance.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had not entered into any leases as a lessee.\nREIT Compliance\nTo qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which is computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP) to our stockholders. We must also meet certain asset and income tests, as well as other requirements. We monitor the operations and transactions that may potentially impact our REIT status. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates.\nDistributions\nOur board of directors has declared daily distributions that are paid on a monthly basis. We expect to continue paying monthly distributions unless our results of operations, our general financial condition, general economic conditions or other factors prohibit us from doing so. We may declare distributions in excess of our FFO. As a result, our distribution rate and payment frequency may vary from time to time. However, to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, we must make distributions equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income\u201d each year.\nDistributions declared (1) accrued daily to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on each day, (2) were payable in cumulative amounts on or before the third day of each calendar month with respect to the prior month and (3) were calculated at a rate of $0.002466 per share per day during the year ended December 31, 2015, which if paid each day over a 365-day period is equivalent to a 6.0% annualized distribution rate based on a purchase price of $15.00 per share of common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2016, distributions declared were calculated at a rate of $0.002459 per share per day, which if paid over a 366-day period is equivalent to a 6.0% annualized distribution rate based on a purchase price of $15.00 per share of common stock.\nThe distributions declared and paid for the four fiscal quarters of 2016, along with the amount of distributions reinvested pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, were as follows:\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Distributions Paid(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sources of Distributions Paid\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Distributions Declared(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Distributions Declared Per Share(1)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Reinvested\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cash Flow From Operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Offering Proceeds\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Quarter 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,062,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,793,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,442,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,235,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,235,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,745,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second Quarter 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,942,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,020,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,698,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,719,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,524,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,195,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,524,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third Quarter 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,135,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,220,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,889,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,109,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,504,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,604,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,504,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth Quarter 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,216,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,217,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,850,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,068,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,068,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,165,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,357,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,252,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,880,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,132,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,332,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,800,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,939,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Distributions during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were based on daily record dates and calculated at a rate of $0.002459 and $0.002466 per share per day, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Assumes each share was issued and outstanding each day during the period presented.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Distributions are paid on a monthly basis.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, our net loss was $37,682,474, we had FFO of $30,309,069 and net cash provided by operations of $38,939,853. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we funded $37,332,787, or 91%, of total distributions paid, including shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, from net cash provided by operating activities and $3,800,065, or 9%, from net public offering proceeds. Since inception, of the $60,352,790 in total distributions paid through December 31, 2016, including shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, 66% of such amounts were funded from cash flow from operations and 34% were funded from net public offering proceeds. For information on how we calculate FFO and the reconciliation of FFO to net loss, see -Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations.\u201d\nOur long-term policy is to pay distributions solely from cash flow from operations. Because we may receive income from interest or rents at various times during our fiscal year and because we may need cash flow from operations during a particular period to fund capital expenditures and other expenses, we expect that from time to time during our operational stage, we will declare distributions in anticipation of cash flow that we expect to receive during a later period, and we expect to pay these distributions in advance of our actual receipt of these funds. In these instances, our board of directors has the authority under our organizational documents, to the extent permitted by Maryland law, to fund distributions from sources such as borrowings, offering proceeds or advances and the deferral of fees and expense reimbursements by our advisor, in its sole discretion. We have not established a limit on the amount of proceeds we may use from sources other than cash flow from operations to fund distributions. If we pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, we will have fewer funds available for investments.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nRelated-Party Transactions and Agreements\nWe have entered into agreements with our advisor and its affiliates, whereby we pay certain fees to, or reimburse certain expenses of, our advisor or its affiliates for acquisition and advisory fees and expenses, financing coordination fees, organization and offering costs, sales commissions, dealer manager fees, asset and property management fees and expenses, leasing fees and reimbursement of certain operating costs. See Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, Director Independence\u201d and Note 7 (Related Party Arrangements) to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a discussion of the various related-party transactions, agreements and fees.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nBelow is a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are critical because they involve significant judgments and assumptions, require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and because they are important for understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements. Other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\nReal Estate Assets\nDepreciation and Amortization\nReal estate costs related to the development, construction and improvement of properties are capitalized. Acquisition costs related to business combinations are expensed as incurred. Acquisition costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized. Repair and maintenance and tenant turnover costs are charged to expense as incurred and significant replacements and betterments are capitalized. Repair and maintenance and tenant turnover costs include all costs that do not extend the useful life of the real estate asset. We consider the period of future benefit of an asset to determine its appropriate useful life and anticipate the estimated useful lives of assets by class to be generally as follows:\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Buildings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Building improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5-25 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Shorter of lease term or expected useful life\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant origination and absorption costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Remaining term of related lease\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Furniture, fixtures, and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5-10 years\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReal Estate Purchase Price Allocation\nWe record the acquisition of income-producing real estate or real estate that will be used for the production of income as a business combination. All assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at their acquisition-date fair values. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.\nWe assess the acquisition-date fair values of all tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers (e.g., discounted cash flow analysis) and that utilize appropriate discount and/or capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it was vacant.\nIntangible assets include the value of in-place leases, which represents the estimated value of the net cash flows of the in-place leases to be realized, as compared to the net cash flows that would have occurred had the property been vacant at the time of acquisition and subject to lease-up.\nWe estimate the value of resident origination and absorption costs by considering the estimated carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, considering current market conditions. In estimating carrying costs, we estimate the amount of lost rentals using market rates during the expected lease-up periods.\nWe amortize the value of in-place leases to expense over the remaining non-cancelable term of the respective leases. Should a resident terminate its lease, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value and customer relationship intangibles would be charged to expense in that period.\nWe record above-market and below-market in-place lease values for acquired properties based on the present value (using an interest rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (2) our estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease. We amortize any capitalized above-market or below-market lease values as a reduction or increase to rental income over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases.\nEstimates of the fair values of the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities require us to make significant assumptions to estimate market lease rates, property-operating expenses, carrying costs during lease-up periods, discount rates, market absorption periods, and the number of years the property will be held for investment. The use of inappropriate assumptions could result in an incorrect valuation of acquired tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities, which could impact the amount of our net income (loss).\nImpairment of Real Estate Assets\nWe account for our real estate assets in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, or ASC 360. ASC 360\nrequires us to continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of our real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability of the assets by estimating whether we will recover the carrying value of the asset through its undiscounted future cash flows and its eventual disposition. Based on this analysis, if we do not believe that we will be able to recover the carrying value of the real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities, we record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities. If any assumptions, projections or estimates regarding an asset changes in the future, we may have to record an impairment to reduce the net book value of such individual asset.\nRents and Other Receivables\nWe periodically evaluate the collectability of amounts due from residents and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of residents to make required payments under lease agreements. We exercise judgment in establishing these allowances and consider payment history and current credit status of residents in developing these estimates. Due to the short-term nature of the operating leases, we do not maintain a deferred rent receivable related to the straight-lining of rents. Other receivables include amounts due from the transfer agent for stock subscription net proceeds.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe lease apartment homes under operating leases with terms generally of twelve months or less. Generally, credit investigations are performed for prospective residents and security deposits are obtained. We recognize minimum rent, including rental abatements, concessions and contractual fixed increases attributable to operating leases, on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease and amounts expected to be received in later years are recorded as deferred rents. We record property operating expense reimbursements due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes, and other recoverable costs in the period the related expenses are incurred.\nWe will recognize gains on sales of real estate either in total or deferred for a period of time, depending on whether a sale has been consummated, the extent of the buyer's investment in the property being sold, whether the receivable is subject to future subordination, and the degree of our continuing involvement with the property after the sale. If the criteria for profit recognition under the full-accrual method are not met, we will defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the percentage-of-completion, reduced profit, deposit, installment or cost recovery method, as appropriate, until the appropriate criteria are met.\nFair Value Measurements\nUnder GAAP, we are required to measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis. In addition, we are required to measure other assets and liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis (e.g., carrying value of impaired real estate loans receivable and long-lived assets). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The GAAP fair value framework uses a three-tiered approach. Fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 1:\n</td> <td>unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 2:\n</td> <td>quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 3:\n</td> <td>prices or valuation techniques where little or no market data is available that requires inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> When available, we utilize quoted market prices from an independent third-party source to determine fair value and will classify such items in Level 1 or Level 2. In instances where the market is not active, regardless of the availability of a non-binding quoted market price, observable inputs might not be relevant and could require us to make a significant adjustment to\nderive a fair value measurement. Additionally, in an inactive market, a market price quoted from an independent third party may rely more on models with inputs based on information available only to that independent third party. When we determine the market for a financial instrument we own to be illiquid or when market transactions for similar instruments do not appear orderly, we use several valuation sources (including internal valuations, discounted cash flow analysis and quoted market prices) and we establish a fair value by assigning weights to the various valuation sources.\nChanges in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these estimated fair values. In this regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nWe amortize the fair value of stock-based compensation awards to expense over the vesting period and record any dividend equivalents earned as dividends for financial reporting purposes. Stock-based compensation awards are valued at the fair value on the date of grant and amortized as an expense over the vesting period.\nOrganization and Offering Costs\nOrganization and offering expenses included all expenses (other than sales commissions and the dealer manager fee) paid by us in connection with our initial public offering, including legal, accounting, tax, printing, mailing and filing fees, charges of our escrow agent and transfer agent, expenses of organizing our company, data processing fees, advertising and sales literature costs, transfer agent costs, out-of-pocket due diligence costs and amounts to reimburse our advisor or its affiliates for the salaries of its employees and other costs in connection with preparing supplemental sales materials and providing other administrative services in connection with our initial public offering. Any such reimbursement did not exceed actual expenses incurred by our advisor. Following the termination of our initial public offering, our advisor had an obligation to reimburse us to the extent total organization and offering expenses borne by us (including selling commissions and dealer manager fees) exceed 15% of the gross proceeds raised in our initial public offering. No amounts were owed to us by our advisor pursuant to the advisory agreement because total organization and offering expenses did not exceed 15% of the gross offering proceeds raised in our initial public offering.\nTo the extent we did not pay the full sales commissions or dealer manager fee for shares sold in our initial public offering, we could also reimburse costs of training and education meetings held by us (primarily the travel, meal and lodging costs of registered representatives of broker-dealers), attendance and sponsorship fees and cost reimbursement of employees of our affiliates to attend seminars conducted by broker-dealers and, in certain cases, reimbursement to participating broker-dealers for technology costs associated with our initial public offering, costs and expenses related to such technology costs, and costs and expenses associated with the facilitation of the marketing of our shares and the ownership of our shares by such broker-dealers' customers. Through the termination of our initial public offering, underwriting compensation paid by us did not exceed 10% of the gross offering proceeds raised in our initial public offering.\nWhen recognized, organization costs are expensed as incurred. Offering costs, including selling commissions and dealer manager fees, are deferred and charged to stockholders' equity as such amounts are reimbursed to the advisor, the dealer manager or their affiliates from gross offering proceeds.\nIncome Taxes\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code and have operated as such commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2014. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders (which is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP). As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we distribute qualifying dividends to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost, unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. However, we believe we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a REIT.\nWe follow the income tax guidance under GAAP to recognize, measure, present and disclose in our consolidated financial statements uncertain tax positions that we have taken or expect to take on a tax return. As of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we did not have any liabilities for uncertain tax positions that we believe should be recognized in our consolidated financial statements. We have not been assessed interest or penalties by any major tax jurisdictions. Our evaluation was performed for all tax years through December 31, 2016.\nSubsequent Events\nDistributions Paid\nOn January 3, 2017, we paid distributions of $3,788,605, which related to distributions declared for each day in the period from December 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and consisted of cash distributions paid in the amount of $1,796,334 and $1,992,271 in shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan.\nOn February 1, 2017, we paid distributions of $3,808,938, which related to distributions declared for each day in the period from January 1, 2017 through January 31, 2017 and consisted of cash distributions paid in the amount of $1,813,252 and $1,995,686 in shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan.\nOn March 1, 2017, we paid distributions of $3,445,424, which related to distributions declared for each day in the period from February 1, 2017 through February 28, 2017 and consisted of cash distributions paid in the amount of $1,646,144 and $1,799,280 in shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan.\nEstimated Value per Share\nOn February 14, 2017, our board of directors determined an estimated value per share of our common stock of $14.85 as of December 31, 2016. See Item 5. Market For Registrant's Common Equity, Related Shareholders Matters and Purchases of Equity Securities - Estimated Value Per Share.\u201d In connection with the determination of an estimated value per share, our board of directors determined a price per share for our distribution reinvestment plan of $14.85, effective March 1, 2017. Distributions that accrue during the month of February 2017, which will be paid in March 2017, will be reinvested at $14.85 per share on the March distribution payment date pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan.\nDistributions Declared\nOn March 15, 2017, our board of directors approved and authorized a daily distribution to stockholders of record as of the close of business on each day of the period commencing on April 1, 2017 and ending on June 30, 2017. The distributions will be equal to $0.002466 per share of our common stock. The distributions for each record date in April 2017, May 2017 and June 2017 will be paid in May 2017, June 2017 and July 2017, respectively. The distributions will be payable to stockholders from legally available funds therefor.", "item_7_truncated": "Depreciation and Amortization\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Three Months Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,579,364\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17,510,929\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(37,682,474\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(50,694,124\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,840,455\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fees to affiliates(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,179,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,936,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,401,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,730,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,396,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,075,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,875,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,991,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,438,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,316,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,776,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,337,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,060,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,275,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,589,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,309,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>721,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,848,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,739,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,670,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,907,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,681,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,569,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,035,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other gains and losses(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(56,516\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,512\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(709,116\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,714,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,253,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,592,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,110,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,169,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe record above-market and below-market in-place lease values for acquired properties based on the present value (using an interest rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (2) our estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease.

The increase of $11,498,571 was due to the acquisition of four multifamily properties since December 31, 2015 and the continuing operation of the properties owned as of December 31, 2015. We expect these amounts may increase in future periods as a result of municipal property tax rate increases as well as increases in the assessed value of our property

The increase of $17,164,137 was primarily due to operating 34 multifamily properties as of December 31, 2016 compared to 30 multifamily properties as of December 31, 2015. We expect that these amounts will decrease as a percentage of total revenues as we implement operational efficiencies at our multifamily properties.\nOur board of directors has declared daily distributions that are paid on a monthly basis. We expect to continue paying monthly distributions unless our results of operations, our general financial condition, general economic conditions or other factors prohibit us from doing so. We may declare distributions in excess of our FFO. As a result, our distribution rate and payment frequency may vary from time to time. However, to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, we must make distributions equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income\u201d each year.\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td>

the year ended December 31, 2015. The 7.8% increase in same-store net operating income was a result of a 6.6% increase in same-store rental revenues offset by a 4.9% increase in same-store operating expenses.\nOn February 1, 2017, we paid distributions of $3,808,938, which related to distributions declared for each day in the period from January 1, 2017 through January 31, 2017 and consisted of cash distributions paid in the amount of $1,813,252 and $1,995,686 in shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan.\nDepreciation and amortization\n________________\nOur results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are not indicative of those expected in future periods. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had not yet invested all of the proceeds from our initial public offering and therefore increased our borrowings and made acquisitions during the period, which had a significant impact on our future results of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had deployed the remaining offering proceeds and continued to perform value-enhancements projects, which had a significant impact on our results of operations. In general, we expect that our revenues and expenses related to our portfolio will increase in future periods as a result of organic rent increases and anticipated value-enhancement projects.\nOver the longer term, in addition to the same sources of capital we will rely on to meet our short-term liquidity requirements, we may also conduct additional public or private offerings of our securities. We expect these resources will be adequate to fund our operating activities, debt service and distributions, and will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operating activities as well as providing capital for investment in future development and other joint ventures along with potential forward purchase commitments.\nInterest expense\nWe account for our real estate assets in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, or ASC 360. ASC 360\n (1) By excluding expensed acquisition costs, management believes MFFO provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management's analysis of the investing and operating performance of our properties. Acquisition fees and expenses include payments to our advisor or third parties. Acquisition fees and expenses under GAAP are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income (loss) and income (loss) from continuing operations, both of which are performance measures under GAAP. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net \n\nDepreciation and amortization expenses were $42,438,760 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $5,316,510 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $37,122,250 was primarily due to the net increase in depreciable and amortizable assets of $867,876,870 since December 31, 2014.\nIntangible assets include the value of in-place leases, which represents the estimated value of the net cash flows of the in-place leases to be realized, as compared to the net cash flows that would have occurred had the property been vacant at the time of acquisition and subject to lease-up.\nRents and Other Receivables\nWe amortize the value of in-place leases to expense over the remaining non-cancelable term of the respective leases. Should a resident terminate its lease, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value and customer relationship intangibles would be charged to expense in that period.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we had a net loss of $37,682,474 compared to $50,694,124 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net loss of $13,011,650 over the comparable prior year period was primarily due to the increase in total revenues of $75,560,761, the decrease in acquisition costs of $4,887,998 and the decrease in fees to affiliates of $1,672,046, partially offset by the increase in operating, maintenance and management expenses of $17,164,137, the increase in real estate taxes and insurance of $11,498,571, the increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $25,552,783, the increase in interest expense of $12,784,551 and the increase in general and administrative expenses of $2,109,113. The increase in these expenses was primarily due to the increase in our property portfolio from 30 multifamily properties as of December 31, 2015 to 34 multifamily properties as of December 31, 2016.\nUse of Estimates\nHowever, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes general and administrative costs, interest expense, interest income and other expense, acquisition costs, certain fees to affiliates, depreciation and amortization expense and gains or losses from the sale of properties, and other gains and losses as stipulated by GAAP, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which are significant economic costs. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of net income which further limits its usefulness.\nNet Operating Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we had a net loss of $50,694,124 compared to $11,840,455 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in net loss of $38,853,669 over the comparable prior year period was primarily due to the increase in operating, maintenance and management expenses of $16,686,939, the increase in real estate taxes and insurance of $8,326,354, the increase in fees to affiliates of $20,623,305, the increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $37,122,250, the increase in interest expense of $11,685,756, the increase in general and administrative expenses of $1,069,517 and the increase in acquisition costs of $4,534,035, partially offset by the increase in total revenues of $61,194,487. The increase in these expenses was due primarily to the increase in our property portfolio from seven multifamily properties at December 31, 2014 to 30 multifamily properties at December 31, 2015.\nWhen recognized, organization costs are expensed as incurred. Offering costs, including selling commissions and dealer manager fees, are deferred and charged to stockholders' equity as such amounts are reimbursed to the advisor, the dealer manager or their affiliates from gross offering proceeds.\nTo the extent we did not pay the full sales commissions or dealer manager fee for shares sold in our initial public offering, we could also reimburse costs of training and education meetings held by us (primarily the travel, meal and lodging costs of registered representatives of broker-dealers), attendance and sponsorship fees and cost reimbursement of employees of our affiliates to attend seminars conducted by broker-dealers and, in certain cases, reimbursement to participating broker-dealers for technology costs associated with our initial public offering, costs and expenses related to such technology costs, and costs and expenses associated with the facilitation of the marketing of our shares and the ownership of our shares by such broker-dealers' customers. Through the termination of our initial public offering, underwriting compensation paid by us did not exceed 10% of the gross offering proceeds raised in our initial public offering.\nThe following table summarizes the consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nWe assess the acquisition-date fair values of all tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers (e.g., discounted cash flow analysis) and that utilize appropriate discount and/or capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it was vacant.\nSame-store revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $31,300,101 compared to $29,375,557 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The 6.6% increase in same-store revenues was primarily due to average rent increases at the same-store properties from $997 as of December 31, 2015 to $1,055 as of December 31, 2016, as a result of ordinary monthly rent increases and the completion of value-enhancement projects.\nFor purposes of evaluating comparative operating performance for the year, we categorize our properties as same-store\u201d or non-same-store.\u201d A same-store\u201d property is a property that was owned at January 1, 2015. A non-same-store\u201d property is a property that was acquired, placed into service or disposed of after January 1, 2015. As of December 31, 2016, seven properties were categorized as same-store properties.\na supplemental measure for publicly registered non-listed REITs and which we believe to be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a public, non-listed REIT having the characteristics described above. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate with a limited life and targeted exit strategy, as currently intended. We believe that, because MFFO excludes costs that we consider more reflective of investing activities and other non-operating items included in FFO and also excludes acquisition fees and expenses that affect our operations only in periods in which properties are acquired, MFFO can provide, on a going forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of our operating performance after the period in which we are acquiring our properties and once our portfolio is in place. By providing MFFO, we believe we are presenting useful information that assists investors and analysts to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our offering has been completed and our properties have been acquired. We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the non-listed REIT industry. Further, we believe MFFO is useful in comparing the sustainability of our operating performance after our offering and acquisitions are completed with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies that are not as involved in acquisition activities. Investors are cautioned that MFFO should only be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our offering has been completed and properties have been acquired, as it excludes acquisition costs that have a negative effect on our operating performance during the periods in which properties are acquired.\n \u2022 $2,156,699 of cash paid for the repurchase of common stock; and \n \u2022 equity capital from joint venture partners; and \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $269,344,362 compared to $910,962,748 during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of our acquisition of four multifamily properties during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 23 acquisitions of multifamily properties during the year ended December 31, 2015. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of the following:\nEstimates of the fair values of the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities require us to make significant assumptions to estimate market lease rates, property-operating expenses, carrying costs during lease-up periods, discount rates, market absorption periods, and the number of years the property will be held for investment. The use of inappropriate assumptions could result in an incorrect valuation of acquired tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities, which could impact the amount of our net income (loss).\nWe define FFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004, or the White Paper. The White Paper defines FFO as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property and non-cash impairment charges of real estate related investments, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. In particular, we believe it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges, as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations and assessments regarding general market conditions which can change over time. An asset will only be evaluated for impairment if certain impairment indications exist and if the carrying, or book value, exceeds the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows (including net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP) from such asset. Investors should note, however, that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows, are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and the relatively limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT's policy described above.\n \u2022 $40,588,872 of proceeds from issuance of mortgage notes payable, net of deferred financing costs in the amount of $1,005,250 and principal payments of $255,878; \nDistributions Declared\n (2) Other gains and losses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 include non-recurring insurance claim recoveries and other non-operating losses that are not included in NOI.  Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nDepreciation and amortization\nWe were formed on August 22, 2013, as a Maryland corporation that has elected to qualify as a REIT. We invest in and manage a diverse portfolio of multifamily properties located in targeted markets throughout the United States. In addition to our focus on multifamily properties, we may also make selective strategic acquisitions of other types of commercial properties. We may also acquire or originate mortgage, mezzanine, bridge and other real estate loans and equity securities of other real estate companies.\nOn January 3, 2017, we paid distributions of $3,788,605, which related to distributions declared for each day in the period from December 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and consisted of cash distributions paid in the amount of $1,796,334 and $1,992,271 in shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan.\nThe following table presents the same-store and non-same-store results from operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n (2) GAAP basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes real estate values diminish over time. In an effort to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate assets the Board of Governors of NAREIT established the measurement tool of FFO. Since its introduction, FFO has become a widely used non-GAAP financial measure among REITs. Additionally, we use MFFO, as defined by the Investment Program Association, as a supplemental measure to evaluate our operating performance. MFFO is \nOperating, maintenance and management expenses\nFees to affiliates were $26,301,919 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $5,678,614 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $20,623,305 was primarily due to acquisition fees and loan coordination fees of $10,067,980 and $6,593,644, respectively, earned by our advisor in connection with the acquisition of 23 multifamily properties with an aggregate contract purchase price of $960,595,000 and financing of 22 multifamily properties in the aggregate amount of $659,364,419 during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to acquisition fees and loan coordination fees of $2,954,149 and $1,969,306, respectively, earned by our advisor in connection with the acquisition and financing of seven multifamily properties with an aggregate contract purchase price of $274,564,250 and financing of $196,930,600 during the year ended December 31, 2014. Additionally, investment management and property management fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of the growth of our portfolio from seven multifamily properties owned as of December 31, 2014 to 30 multifamily properties owned as of December 31, 2015.\n \u2022 $570,108 of cash provided by restricted cash accounts related to replacement reserves; \n (3) Distributions are paid on a monthly basis. Distributions for all record dates of a given month are paid approximately three days following month end.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, we paid aggregate distributions of $41,132,852, including $19,252,136 of distributions paid in cash and 1,521,505 shares of our common stock issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan for $21,880,716. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our net loss was $37,682,474, we had FFO of $30,309,069 and net cash provided by operations of $38,939,853. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we funded $37,332,787, or 91%, of total distributions paid, including shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, from net cash provided by operating activities and $3,800,065, or 9%, from net public offering proceeds. Since inception, of the $60,352,790 in total distributions paid through December 31, 2016, including shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, 66% of such amounts were funded from cash flow from operations and 34% were funded from net public offering proceeds. For information on how we calculate FFO and the reconciliation of FFO to net loss, see -Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations.\u201d\nRelated-Party Transactions and Agreements\nTotal revenues\nPresentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors as they compare the operating performance to that of other public, non-listed REITs, although it should be noted that not all public, non-listed REITs calculate FFO and MFFO the same way, so comparisons with other public, non-listed REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with GAAP measurements as an indication of our performance. MFFO has limitations as a performance measure in an offering such as ours where the price of a share of common stock is a stated value and there is no regular net asset value determinations during the offering stage and for a period thereafter. MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and net asset value is disclosed. MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating net asset value because impairments are taken into account in determining net asset value but not in determining MFFO.\n \u2022 current unrestricted cash balance, which was $26,768,318 as of December 31, 2016; \n (2) Acquisition fees and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 include acquisition fees of $2,766,209, $10,067,980 and $2,954,149 and loan coordination fees of $1,539,500, $6,593,644 and $1,969,306, respectively, that are recorded in fees to affiliates in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Acquisition fees and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 also include acquisition expenses of $1,681,768, $6,569,766 and $2,035,731, respectively, that are recorded in acquisition costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  FFO and MFFO may be used to fund all or a portion of certain capitalizable items that are excluded from FFO and MFFO, such as tenant improvements, building improvements and deferred leasing costs.\nFees to affiliates were $24,629,873 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $26,301,919 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease of $1,672,046 was primarily due to the decrease in acquisition fees and loan coordination fees as a result of the acquisition of four multifamily properties during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the acquisition of 23 multifamily properties during the year ended December 31, 2015, partially offset by an increase in investment management and property management fees as a result of the growth of our portfolio. We expect fees to affiliates related to the on-going management of our real estate portfolio to increase in future periods as a result of increased property management fees from anticipated increases in future rental income. We expect fees to affiliates related to initial acquisition and financing activities to decrease in future periods as a result of the termination of the initial public offering and the decrease in anticipated future acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related investments.\nDuring times of economic downturn, market conditions could negatively impact the multifamily real estate sector, resulting in lower occupancy, lower rental rates and declining values. The economy in the United States has improved; however, there is no assurance that economic conditions will continue to improve or will not worsen in the future. We believe we currently have unique investment opportunities, particularly in the multifamily sector. Home ownership rates are the lowest they have been since 1967. Demographic and economic factors favor the flexibility of rental housing and discourage the potential financial burden associated with home ownership. Additionally, Millennials and Baby Boomers, the two largest demographic groups comprising roughly half of the total population in the United States, are increasingly choosing rental housing over home ownership. Our plan is to provide rental housing for these generational groups as they age. Millennials are getting married and having children later and are choosing to live in apartment communities until their mid-30s. Today, 30% of Millennials are still living with their parents or are still in school. When they get a job, Millennials will likely rent moderate income apartments based upon an average income of $35,000 to $55,000. We believe these factors will continue to contribute to the demand for multifamily housing.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nOn March 15, 2017, our board of directors approved and authorized a daily distribution to stockholders of record as of the close of business on each day of the period commencing on April 1, 2017 and ending on June 30, 2017. The distributions will be equal to $0.002466 per share of our common stock. The distributions for each record date in April 2017, May 2017 and June 2017 will be paid in May 2017, June 2017 and July 2017, respectively. The distributions will be payable to stockholders from legally available funds therefor.\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\n \u2022 borrowings under master repurchase agreements; \nDue to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, NAREIT, an industry trade group, has promulgated a measure known as FFO, which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. FFO is not equivalent to our net income (loss) as determined under GAAP.\nWe follow the income tax guidance under GAAP to recognize, measure, present and disclose in our consolidated financial statements uncertain tax positions that we have taken or expect to take on a tax return. As of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we did not have any liabilities for uncertain tax positions that we believe should be recognized in our consolidated financial statements. We have not been assessed interest or penalties by any major tax jurisdictions. Our evaluation was performed for all tax years through December 31, 2016.\nservice and loan to value requirements). The line of credit has a maturity date of May 17, 2019, subject to extension, as further described in the loan agreement entered into by certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries with PNC Bank in connection with the acquisition of the Landings of Brentwood property. As of December 31, 2016, $35,000,000 was outstanding on our line of credit. We have the option to select the interest rate in respect of the outstanding unpaid principal amount of the line of credit loans from the following options (1) the sum of the Base Rate (as defined in the loan agreement) plus 0.60% or (2) a rate per annum fixed for the applicable LIBOR Interest Period (as defined in the loan agreement) equal to the sum of LIBOR plus 1.60%. Monthly interest payments are due and payable in arrears on the first day of each month until the line of credit maturity date. The entire outstanding principal balance and any accrued and unpaid interest on the line of credit loans are due and payable in full on the line of credit maturity date. For additional information on our Line of Credit, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report. We continue to evaluate possible other sources of capital, including, without limitation, entering into additional credit facilities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such financing on favorable terms, if at all.\n\nOn May 18, 2016, we entered into a secured revolving line of credit facility, or the line of credit, with PNC Bank in an amount not to exceed $65,000,000. The line of credit provides for advances solely for the purpose of financing the costs in connection with acquisitions and development of real estate projects and for general corporate purposes (subject to certain debt\nNOI is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. NOI is used by investors and our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties, to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of our properties as it is not affected by (1) the cost of funds, (2) acquisition costs, (3) non-operating fees to affiliates, (4) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP or (5) general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses that are specific to us. The cost of funds is eliminated from net income (loss) because it is specific to our particular financing capabilities and constraints. The cost of funds is also eliminated because it is dependent on historical interest rates and other costs of capital as well as past decisions made by us regarding the appropriate mix of capital which may have changed or may change in the future. Acquisition costs and non-operating fees to affiliates are eliminated because they do not reflect continuing operating costs of the property owner.\n______________\nWe use secured borrowings, and intend to use in the future secured and unsecured borrowings. At December 31, 2016, our debt was approximately 58% of the value of our properties, as determined by an independent third-party appraiser. Going forward, we expect that our borrowings will be approximately 55% to 60% of the value of our properties (after debt amortization) and other real estate-related assets. For valuation purposes, the value of a property will equal the value determined by an independent qualified valuation expert. Under our charter, we are prohibited from borrowing in excess of 300% of the value of our net assets, which generally approximates to 75% of the aggregate cost of our assets, though we may exceed this limit only under certain circumstances.\nrequires us to continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of our real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability of the assets by estimating whether we will recover the carrying value of the asset through its undiscounted future cash flows and its eventual disposition. Based on this analysis, if we do not believe that we will be able to recover the carrying value of the real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities, we record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities. If any assumptions, projections or estimates regarding an asset changes in the future, we may have to record an impairment to reduce the net book value of such individual asset.\nThe following is a reconciliation of our NOI to net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 computed in accordance with GAAP:\nFees to affiliates\npremiums, audit fees, other professional fees and independent director compensation. The increase of $1,069,517 was primarily due to the acquisition of 23 multifamily properties during December 31, 2015 and the continuing operation of the properties owned as of December 31, 2014.\nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\n\nSubsequent Events\nOverview\nOn December 30, 2013, we commenced our initial public offering of up to 66,666,667 shares of common stock at an initial price of $15.00 per share and up to 7,017,544 shares of common stock pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan at an initial price of $14.25 per share. On March 24, 2016, we terminated our initial public offering. As of March 24, 2016, we had sold 48,625,651 shares of common stock for gross offering proceeds of $724,849,631, including 1,011,561 shares of common stock issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan for gross offering proceeds of $14,414,752. Following the termination of our initial public offering, we have continued to offer shares of our common stock pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. As of December 31, 2016, we had sold 49,835,344 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $742,287,907, including 2,221,317 shares of common stock issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan for gross offering proceeds of $31,853,028.\nSubject to certain restrictions and limitations, our advisor manages our day-to-day operations and our portfolio of properties and real estate-related assets. Our advisor sources and presents investment opportunities to our board of directors. Our advisor also provides investment management, marketing, investor relations and other administrative services on our behalf.\nOperating, maintenance and management expenses were $18,480,708 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1,793,769 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $16,686,939 was primarily due to operating 30 multifamily properties as of December 31, 2015 compared to seven multifamily properties as of December 31, 2014.\nIn addition to using our capital resources for investing purposes and meeting our debt obligations, we expect to use our capital resources to make certain payments to our advisor. We expect to make payments to our advisor in connection with the management of our asset portfolio and costs incurred by our advisor in providing services to us.\nWe record the acquisition of income-producing real estate or real estate that will be used for the production of income as a business combination. All assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at their acquisition-date fair values. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.\nIncome Taxes\nOn August 26, 2015, we entered into a revolving credit facility, or the credit facility, with PNC Bank, National Association or PNC Bank, in an amount not to exceed $200,000,000, which provides for advances to purchase properties or refinance existing properties from time to time (subject to certain debt service and loan to value requirements). The credit facility has a maturity date of September 1, 2020, subject to extension. The maximum amount that may be drawn under the credit facility may be increased up to $350,000,000 at any time during the period from January 1, 2016 to 12 months prior to the maturity date. Advances made under the credit facility will be secured by the property for which such advances are used. As of December 31, 2016, $186,300,000 was outstanding on our credit facility. Interest on the outstanding principal balances of advances accrue at the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus (1) the servicing spread of 0.05% and (2) the net spread, based on the debt service coverage ratio, of between 1.80% and 2.10%, as further described in the applicable notes. Monthly interest payments are due and payable on the first day of each month until the maturity date. The entire outstanding principal balance and any accrued and unpaid interest on all advances are due and payable in full on the maturity date. For additional information on our credit facility, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report.\nConsolidated Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\n \u2022 various forms of secured and unsecured financing; \nOn February 14, 2017, our board of directors determined an estimated value per share of our common stock of $14.85 as of December 31, 2016. See Item 5. Market For Registrant's Common Equity, Related Shareholders Matters and Purchases of Equity Securities - Estimated Value Per Share.\u201d In connection with the determination of an estimated value per share, our board of directors determined a price per share for our distribution reinvestment plan of $14.85, effective March 1, 2017. Distributions that accrue during the month of February 2017, which will be paid in March 2017, will be reinvested at $14.85 per share on the March distribution payment date pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $4,848,801 compared to $2,739,688 for the year ended December 31, 2015. These general and administrative costs consisted primarily of legal fees, insurance premiums, audit fees, other professional fees and independent director compensation. The increase of $2,109,113 was primarily due to the acquisition of four multifamily properties since December 31, 2015 and the continuing operation of the properties owned as of December 31, 2015. We expect general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of total revenues.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $2,739,688 compared to $1,670,171 for the year ended December 31, 2014. These general and administrative costs consisted primarily of legal fees, insurance\n \u2022 $35,000,000 of proceeds from borrowings from our line of credit; \n\nMarket Outlook\n (2) For information on how we calculate FFO and MFFO and a reconciliation of FFO and MFFO to net loss, see -Funds From Operations and Modified Funds From Operations.\u201d \nRevenues\nSubstantially all of our business is conducted through our operating partnership. We are the sole general partner of our operating partnership and one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is the only limited partner of our operating partnership. As we accepted subscriptions for shares of common stock, we transferred substantially all of the net proceeds of the initial public offering to our operating partnership as a capital contribution. The limited partnership agreement of our operating partnership provides that our operating partnership will be operated in a manner that will enable us to (1) satisfy the requirements for being classified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, (2) avoid any federal income or excise tax liability and (3) ensure that our operating partnership will not be classified as a publicly traded partnership\u201d for purposes of Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code, which classification could result in our operating partnership being taxed as a corporation, rather than as a disregarded entity. In addition to the administrative and operating costs and expenses incurred by our operating partnership in acquiring and operating our investments, our operating partnership will pay all of our administrative costs and expenses, and such expenses will be treated as expenses of our operating partnership.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $13,275,604 compared to $1,589,848 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $11,685,756 was primarily due to the net increase in the notes payable balance of $655,114,621 since December 31, 2014 due to financing incurred in connection with the acquisition of 22 multifamily properties during the year ended December 31, 2015. Included in interest expense is the amortization of deferred financing costs of $419,743 and $39,245, unrealized loss on derivative instruments of $2,554,041 and $578,014 and credit facility commitment fees of $30,254 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nWe will recognize gains on sales of real estate either in total or deferred for a period of time, depending on whether a sale has been consummated, the extent of the buyer's investment in the property being sold, whether the receivable is subject to future subordination, and the degree of our continuing involvement with the property after the sale. If the criteria for profit recognition under the full-accrual method are not met, we will defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the percentage-of-completion, reduced profit, deposit, installment or cost recovery method, as appropriate, until the appropriate criteria are met.\nRevenue Recognition\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\n \u2022 $7,092,300 of cash used for deposits for potential real estate investments; \nChanges in the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP (for acquisition fees and expenses from a capitalization/depreciation model to an expensed-as-incurred model) that were put into effect in 2009 and other changes to GAAP accounting for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition fees and expenses for all industries as items that are expensed under GAAP, that are typically accounted for as operating expenses. Management believes these fees and expenses do not affect our overall long-term operating performance. Publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation. While other start-up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, we believe that public, non-listed REITs, like us, are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after acquisition activity ceases. Our board of directors will determine to pursue a liquidity event when it believes that the then-current market conditions are favorable. However, our board of directors does not anticipate evaluating a liquidity event (i.e., listing of our common stock on a national exchange, a merger or sale of our company or another similar transaction) until five years after the completion of our offering stage. Thus, as a limited life REIT, we will not continuously purchase assets and will have a limited life.\nBelow is a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are critical because they involve significant judgments and assumptions, require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and because they are important for understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements. Other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.\nReal Estate Assets\nWe lease apartment homes under operating leases with terms generally of twelve months or less. Generally, credit investigations are performed for prospective residents and security deposits are obtained. We recognize minimum rent, including rental abatements, concessions and contractual fixed increases attributable to operating leases, on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease and amounts expected to be received in later years are recorded as deferred rents. We record property operating expense reimbursements due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes, and other recoverable costs in the period the related expenses are incurred.\nNeither the SEC, NAREIT nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and in response to such standardization we may have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO accordingly.\nOrganization and offering expenses included all expenses (other than sales commissions and the dealer manager fee) paid by us in connection with our initial public offering, including legal, accounting, tax, printing, mailing and filing fees, charges of our escrow agent and transfer agent, expenses of organizing our company, data processing fees, advertising and sales literature costs, transfer agent costs, out-of-pocket due diligence costs and amounts to reimburse our advisor or its affiliates for the salaries of its employees and other costs in connection with preparing supplemental sales materials and providing other administrative services in connection with our initial public offering. Any such reimbursement did not exceed actual expenses incurred by our advisor. Following the termination of our initial public offering, our advisor had an obligation to reimburse us to the extent total organization and offering expenses borne by us (including selling commissions and dealer manager fees) exceed 15% of the gross proceeds raised in our initial public offering. No amounts were owed to us by our advisor pursuant to the advisory agreement because total organization and offering expenses did not exceed 15% of the gross offering proceeds raised in our initial public offering.\nWe periodically evaluate the collectability of amounts due from residents and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of residents to make required payments under lease agreements. We exercise judgment in establishing these allowances and consider payment history and current credit status of residents in developing these estimates. Due to the short-term nature of the operating leases, we do not maintain a deferred rent receivable related to the straight-lining of rents. Other receivables include amounts due from the transfer agent for stock subscription net proceeds.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $26,060,155 compared to $13,275,604 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $12,784,551 was primarily due to the increase in the notes payable, net balance of $120,995,126 since December 31, 2015 due to financing incurred in connection with the acquisition of four multifamily properties since December 31, 2015. Included in interest expense is the amortization of deferred financing costs of $937,075 and $419,743, net, unrealized loss on derivative instruments of $270,222 and $2,554,041, amortization of loan discount of $90,718 and $0 and credit facility commitment fees of $65,302 and $30,254 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our interest expense in future periods will vary based on our level of future borrowings, which will depend on the availability and cost of debt financing and the opportunity to acquire real estate and real estate-related investments meeting our investment objectives.\n________________\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur calculation of FFO and MFFO is presented in the following table for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nderive a fair value measurement. Additionally, in an inactive market, a market price quoted from an independent third party may rely more on models with inputs based on information available only to that independent third party. When we determine the market for a financial instrument we own to be illiquid or when market transactions for similar instruments do not appear orderly, we use several valuation sources (including internal valuations, discounted cash flow analysis and quoted market prices) and we establish a fair value by assigning weights to the various valuation sources.\nTo qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which is computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP) to our stockholders. We must also meet certain asset and income tests, as well as other requirements. We monitor the operations and transactions that may potentially impact our REIT status. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates.\n \u2022 proceeds from our distribution reinvestment plan.  Over the short term, we believe that our sources of capital, specifically our cash balances, cash flow from operations, our ability to raise equity capital from joint venture partners and our ability to obtain various forms of secured and unsecured financing, including financing pursuant to our credit facility and line of credit each described below, will be adequate to meet our liquidity requirements and capital commitments.\n (1) Fees to affiliates for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016 exclude property management fees of $1,139,958 and $4,140,513 and other fees of $228,061 and $1,087,408, respectively, that are included in NOI. Fees to affiliates for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015 exclude property management fees of $805,411 and $1,987,517 and other fees of $224,683 and $584,060, respectively, that are included in NOI. Fees to affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2014 exclude property management fees of $206,552 and other fees of $75,779, that are included in NOI. \n______________\n____________________\nOur management uses MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate MFFO in order to evaluate our performance against other public, non-listed REITs which have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies shortly thereafter. As noted above, MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate in this manner. We believe that our use of MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate\nTo provide additional insight into our operating results, we are also providing a detailed analysis of same-store versus non-same-store NOI. For more information on NOI and a reconciliation of NOI (a non-GAAP financial measure) to net loss, see -Net Operating Income.\u201d\n (1) See -Net Operating Income\u201d below for a reconciliation of NOI to net loss.  Net Operating Income\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur Real Estate Portfolio\nAcquisition costs\nWith respect to other commercial properties, we expect in the future to include provisions in our leases designed to protect us from the impact of inflation. These provisions include reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements, or in some cases annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain allowance.\n________________\nReal estate taxes and insurance expenses were $9,337,432 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1,011,078 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $8,326,354 was due to the acquisition of 23 multifamily properties during the year ended December 31, 2015 and the continuing operation of the properties owned as of December 31, 2014.\nOverview\nFair Value Measurements\nSubstantially all of our multifamily property leases are for a term of one year or less. In an inflationary environment, this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Short-term leases generally will minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation, although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore will expose us to the effects of a decline in market rents. In a deflationary rent environment, we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter term leases.\nImpairment of Real Estate Assets\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n \u2022 $171,606,413 of cash provided by offering proceeds related to our public offering net of (1) payments of commissions on sales of common stock and related dealer manager fees in the amount of $16,862,099 and (2) the reimbursement of other offering costs to affiliates in the amount of $5,485,093; \nWe commenced real estate operations with the acquisition of our first multifamily property on May 22, 2014. As of December 31, 2016, we owned 34 multifamily properties. During the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $38,939,853 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $3,258,965 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The change in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to increases in depreciation and amortization and restricted cash partially offset by a decrease in net loss, amounts due to affiliates and accounts payable and accrued liabilities associated with 34 multifamily properties owned as of December 31, 2016, compared to the 30 multifamily properties owned as of December 31, 2015. We expect to continue to generate cash flows from operations as we stabilize the operations of our property portfolio and complete our value-enhancement program.\nDue to the above factors and other unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the Investment Program Association, or IPA, an industry trade group, has standardized a measure known as MFFO, which the IPA has recommended as\nDistributions Paid\nReview of our Policies\nNet loss\n (2) Assumes each share was issued and outstanding each day during the period presented. \nInterest expense\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $225,786,450 compared to $917,012,264 during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities is due primarily to the decrease in proceeds from issuance of mortgage notes payable, borrowings from credit facilities and issuance of common stock from $404,655,500, $186,300,000 and $382,566,638, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2015 to $41,850,000, $35,000,000 and $193,953,605, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2016. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of the following:\n Level 2: quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and \nDepreciation and amortization expenses were $67,991,543 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $42,438,760 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $25,552,783 was primarily due to the net increase in depreciable and amortizable assets of $263,656,918 since December 31, 2015. We expect these amounts to increase slightly in future periods as a result of anticipated future enhancements to our real estate portfolio.\nOur principal demand for funds will be to fund value-enhancement and other capital improvement projects, to pay operating expenses and interest on our outstanding indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. Over time, we intend to generally fund our cash needs, other than asset acquisitions, from operations. Otherwise, we expect that our principal sources of working capital will include:\nWe have entered into agreements with our advisor and its affiliates, whereby we pay certain fees to, or reimburse certain expenses of, our advisor or its affiliates for acquisition and advisory fees and expenses, financing coordination fees, organization and offering costs, sales commissions, dealer manager fees, asset and property management fees and expenses, leasing fees and reimbursement of certain operating costs. See Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, Director Independence\u201d and Note 7 (Related Party Arrangements) to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a discussion of the various related-party transactions, agreements and fees.\nOur MFFO calculation complies with the IPA's Practice Guideline described above. In calculating MFFO, we exclude acquisition related expenses, amortization of above and below market leases, fair value adjustments of derivative financial instruments, deferred rent receivables and the adjustments of such items related to noncontrolling interests. Under GAAP, acquisition fees and expenses are characterized as operating expenses in determining operating net income. These expenses are paid in cash by us. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property. In the event that proceeds from our offerings of shares are not available to fund our reimbursement of acquisition fees and expenses incurred by our advisor, such fees and expenses will need to be reimbursed to our advisor from other sources, including debt, operational earnings or cash flow, net proceeds from the sale of properties, or from ancillary cash flows. The acquisition of properties, and the corresponding acquisition fees and expenses, is the key operational feature of our business plan to generate operational income and cash flow to fund distributions to our stockholders. Further, under GAAP, certain contemplated non-cash fair value and other non-cash adjustments are considered operating non-cash adjustments to net income in determining cash flow from operating activities. In addition, we view fair value adjustments of derivatives and gains and losses from dispositions of assets as non-recurring items or items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized, and which are not reflective of on-going operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance.\nNOI is a measure of the operating performance of our properties but does not measure our performance as a whole. NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income (loss) as computed in accordance with GAAP. This measure should be analyzed in conjunction with net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP and discussions elsewhere in -Results of Operations\u201d regarding the components of net income (loss) that are eliminated in the calculation of NOI. Other companies may use different methods for calculating NOI or similarly entitled measures and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies that do not define the measure exactly as we do.\nTotal revenues were $144,010,514 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $68,449,753 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $75,560,761 was primarily due to operating 34 multifamily properties at December 31, 2016 compared to 30 multifamily properties at December 31, 2015. Additionally, our total units increased by 1,743 from 9,858 at December 31, 2015 to 11,601 at December 31, 2016. Average monthly rents per unit increased from $1,037 as of December 31, 2015 to $1,102 as of December 31, 2016. We expect rental income and tenant reimbursements to increase in future periods as a result of ordinary monthly rent increases, improved occupancy and the implementation of our value-enhancement strategy.\n\n (1) For information on how we calculate NOI and a reconciliation of NOI to net loss, see -Net Operating Income.\u201d \n\n (2) Average monthly rent is based upon the effective rental income after considering the effect of vacancies, concessions and write-offs. \n \u2022 $658,886 of cash provided by proceeds from insurance claims.  Cash Flows from Financing Activities\nWe amortize the fair value of stock-based compensation awards to expense over the vesting period and record any dividend equivalents earned as dividends for financial reporting purposes. Stock-based compensation awards are valued at the fair value on the date of grant and amortized as an expense over the vesting period.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe use secured debt, and intend to use in the future secured and unsecured debt. We believe that the careful use of borrowings will help us achieve our diversification goals and potentially enhance the returns on our investments. At December 31, 2016, our debt was approximately 58% of the value of our properties, as determined by an independent third-party appraiser. Going forward, we expect that our borrowings will be approximately 55% to 60% of the value of our properties (after debt amortization) and other real estate-related assets. For valuation purposes, the value of a property will equal the value determined by an independent third-party appraiser or qualified independent valuation expert. Under our charter, we are prohibited from borrowing in excess of 300% of our net assets, which generally approximates to 75% of the aggregate cost of our assets unless such excess is approved by a majority of the independent directors and disclosed to stockholders, along with a justification for such excess, in our next quarterly report. In such event, we will monitor our debt levels and take action to reduce any such excess as practicable. Our aggregate borrowings are reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly. As of December 31, 2016, our aggregate borrowings were not in excess of 300% of the value of our net assets.\nOn March 1, 2017, we paid distributions of $3,445,424, which related to distributions declared for each day in the period from February 1, 2017 through February 28, 2017 and consisted of cash distributions paid in the amount of $1,646,144 and $1,799,280 in shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan.\nWe define MFFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, consistent with the IPA's Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations, or the Practice Guideline, issued by the IPA in November 2010. The Practice Guideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for the following items, as applicable, included in the determination of GAAP net income: acquisition fees and expenses; amounts relating to deferred rent receivables and amortization of above and below market leases and liabilities (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to a cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments); accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income; nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. The accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments, nonrecurring unrealized gains and losses on hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings, unrealized gains and losses resulting from consolidations, as well as other listed cash flow adjustments are adjustments made to net income in calculating the cash flows provided by operating activities and, in some cases, reflect gains or losses which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized. While we rely on our Advisor for managing interest rate, hedge and foreign exchange risk, we do not retain an outside consultant to review all our hedging agreements. Inasmuch as interest rate hedges are not a fundamental part of our operations, we believe it is appropriate to exclude such non-recurring gains and losses in calculating MFFO, as such gains and losses are not reflective of on-going operations.\nTotal revenues\nWe estimate the value of resident origination and absorption costs by considering the estimated carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, considering current market conditions. In estimating carrying costs, we estimate the amount of lost rentals using market rates during the expected lease-up periods.\n Level 1: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities; \nReal Estate Purchase Price Allocation\nOn March 24, 2016, our board of directors determined an estimated value per share of our common stock of $14.46 as of December 31, 2015. On February 14, 2017, our board of directors determined an estimated value per share of our common stock of $14.85 as of December 31, 2016. For more information on the determination of the estimated value per share of our common stock, see Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Purchases of Equity Securities - Estimated Value Per Share.\u201d In connection with the determination of our estimated value per share, on March 24, 2016 and on February 14, 2017, our board of directors increased the purchase price of shares offered pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan to $14.85 and $14.46, effective March 1, 2017 and May 1, 2016, respectively. In the future, our board of directors may, in its sole discretion and from time to time, change the price at which we offer shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan to reflect changes in our estimated value per share and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.\nTotal revenues were $68,449,753 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $7,255,266 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $61,194,487 was primarily due to operating 30 multifamily properties at December 31, 2015 compared to seven multifamily properties at December 31, 2014. Additionally, our total units increased by 7,363 from 2,495 at December 31, 2014 to 9,858 at December 31, 2015. Average monthly rents per unit increased from $884 as of December 31, 2014 to $1,037 as of December 31, 2015.\nFees to affiliates\nNet loss\n\n (2) Projected principal payments on outstanding debt obligations are based on the terms of the notes payable agreements. Amounts exclude the amortization of the debt discount and net deferred financing costs associated with certain notes payable. \nConsolidated Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nThe distributions declared and paid for the four fiscal quarters of 2016, along with the amount of distributions reinvested pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, were as follows:\nIn addition to making investments in accordance with our investment objectives, we use our capital resources to make certain payments to our advisor and its affiliates. During our organization and offering stage, we made payments to the dealer manager for sales commissions and the dealer manager fees and payments to our advisor for reimbursement of certain organization and offering expenses. Currently, during our operating stage, we make payments to our advisor in connection with the acquisition of investments, the management of our assets and costs incurred by our advisor in providing services to us.\n (1) NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure used by investors and our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties and to determine trends in earnings. However, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes general and administrative costs, interest expense, interest income and other expense, acquisition costs, certain fees to affiliates, depreciation and amortization expense and gains or losses from the sale of our properties and other gains and losses as stipulated by GAAP, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs, all of which are significant economic costs. For additional information on how we calculate NOI and a reconciliation of NOI to net loss, see -Net Operating Income.\u201d \nChanges in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these estimated fair values. In this regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument.\nSame-store operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $13,360,377 compared to $12,735,386 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in same-store operating expenses was primarily attributable to a net increase in property taxes across the same-store properties.\nProperty Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nInflation\nReal estate taxes and insurance\nAcquisition costs\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent that we distribute qualifying dividends to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year in which qualification is lost, unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Failing to qualify as a REIT could materially and adversely affect our net income and results of operations.\nsales proceeds from the disposition of properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to the property. In the event that proceeds from our public offering are not available to fund our reimbursement of acquisition fees and expenses incurred by our advisor, such fees and expenses will need to be reimbursed to the advisor from other sources, including debt, operational earnings or cash flow, net proceeds from the sale of properties, or from ancillary cash flows. The acquisition of properties, and the corresponding acquisition fees and expenses, is the key operational feature of our business plan to generate operational income and cash flow to fund distributions to its stockholders.\n \u2022 $19,252,136 of net cash distributions to our stockholders, after giving effect to distributions reinvested by stockholders of $21,880,716.  Contractual Commitments and Contingencies\n \u2022 $210,030,200 of cash used related to the acquisition of four multifamily properties; \n (1) Projected interest payments on outstanding debt obligations are based on the outstanding principal amounts and interest rates in effect at December 31, 2016. We incurred interest expense of $26,060,155 during the year ended December 31, 2016, including amortization of deferred financing costs totaling $937,075, net unrealized losses from the change in fair value of interest rate cap agreements of $270,222, amortization of loan discount of $90,718 and credit facility commitment fees of $65,302. \nUnder GAAP, we are required to measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis. In addition, we are required to measure other assets and liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis (e.g., carrying value of impaired real estate loans receivable and long-lived assets). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The GAAP fair value framework uses a three-tiered approach. Fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\nAs of December 31, 2016, we owned the 34 multifamily apartment communities listed below: \nDistributions\nOrganization and Offering Costs\n (1) Distributions during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were based on daily record dates and calculated at a rate of $0.002459 and $0.002466 per share per day, respectively. \nAcquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $1,681,768 compared to $6,569,766 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease of $4,887,998 was primarily due to the acquisition of four multifamily properties with an aggregate contract purchase price of $264,222,500 during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the acquisition of 23 multifamily properties with an aggregate contract purchase price of $960,595,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015. We do not expect to incur significant acquisition costs in future periods as we have invested all of the proceeds from our initial public offering.\n Level 3: prices or valuation techniques where little or no market data is available that requires inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.  When available, we utilize quoted market prices from an independent third-party source to determine fair value and will classify such items in Level 1 or Level 2. In instances where the market is not active, regardless of the availability of a non-binding quoted market price, observable inputs might not be relevant and could require us to make a significant adjustment to\nDepreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets are eliminated because they may not accurately represent the actual change in value in our multifamily properties that result from use of the properties or changes in market conditions. While certain aspects of real property do decline in value over time in a manner that is reasonably captured by depreciation and amortization, the value of the properties as a whole have historically increased or decreased as a result of changes in overall economic conditions instead of from actual use of the property or the passage of time. Gains and losses from the sale of real property vary from property to property and are affected by market conditions at the time of sale which will usually change from period to period. These gains and losses can create distortions when comparing one period to another or when comparing our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies that have not made similarly timed purchases or sales. We believe that eliminating these costs from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating our properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.\nOperating Expenses\nReal estate costs related to the development, construction and improvement of properties are capitalized. Acquisition costs related to business combinations are expensed as incurred. Acquisition costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized. Repair and maintenance and tenant turnover costs are charged to expense as incurred and significant replacements and betterments are capitalized. Repair and maintenance and tenant turnover costs include all costs that do not extend the useful life of the real estate asset. We consider the period of future benefit of an asset to determine its appropriate useful life and anticipate the estimated useful lives of assets by class to be generally as follows:\n (3) Mortgage debt outstanding is net of deferred financing costs and loan discount associated with the loans for each individual property listed above but excludes the principal balance of $35,000,000 and associated deferred financing costs of $853,652 related to the revolving credit facilities at the Company level.  During 2016, we acquired four properties for an aggregate contract purchase price of $264,222,500, exclusive of closing costs.\nThe following table summarizes the consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code and have operated as such commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2014. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders (which is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP). As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we distribute qualifying dividends to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost, unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. However, we believe we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a REIT.\nThe discussion that follows is based on our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The ability to compare one period to another is significantly affected by acquisitions completed during those periods in addition to the implementation of our value-enhancement strategy. As of December 31, 2016, we owned 34 multifamily properties compared to 30 multifamily properties at December 31, 2015. The increase in our property portfolio is the primary cause of the increases in operating income and expenses, as further discussed below.\nThe historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, especially if such assets are not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances and/or as requested or required by lessees for operational purposes in order to maintain the value disclosed. We believe that since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation may be less informative. Historical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate related depreciation and amortization, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income. However, FFO, and MFFO as described below, should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP FFO and MFFO measures and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO.\nOur long-term policy is to pay distributions solely from cash flow from operations. Because we may receive income from interest or rents at various times during our fiscal year and because we may need cash flow from operations during a particular period to fund capital expenditures and other expenses, we expect that from time to time during our operational stage, we will declare distributions in anticipation of cash flow that we expect to receive during a later period, and we expect to pay these distributions in advance of our actual receipt of these funds. In these instances, our board of directors has the authority under our organizational documents, to the extent permitted by Maryland law, to fund distributions from sources such as borrowings, offering proceeds or advances and the deferral of fees and expense reimbursements by our advisor, in its sole discretion. We have not established a limit on the amount of proceeds we may use from sources other than cash flow from operations to fund distributions. If we pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, we will have fewer funds available for investments.\nAcquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $6,569,766 compared to $2,035,731 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $4,534,035 was due primarily to the acquisition of 23 multifamily properties with an aggregate contract purchase price of $960,595,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the acquisition of seven multifamily properties with an aggregate contract purchase price of $274,564,250 during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data\u201d above and our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report. Also see Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\u201d preceding Part I.\nOur board of directors, including our independent directors, has reviewed our policies described in this annual report, including policies regarding our investments, leverage and conflicts of interest, and determined that the policies are in the best interests of our stockholders.\nDistributions declared (1) accrued daily to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on each day, (2) were payable in cumulative amounts on or before the third day of each calendar month with respect to the prior month and (3) were calculated at a rate of $0.002466 per share per day during the year ended December 31, 2015, which if paid each day over a 365-day period is equivalent to a 6.0% annualized distribution rate based on a purchase price of $15.00 per share of common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2016, distributions declared were calculated at a rate of $0.002459 per share per day, which if paid over a 366-day period is equivalent to a 6.0% annualized distribution rate based on a purchase price of $15.00 per share of common stock.\nbased on FFO but includes certain adjustments we believe are necessary due to changes in accounting and reporting under GAAP since the establishment of FFO. Neither FFO nor MFFO should be considered as alternatives to net loss or other measurements under GAAP as indicators of our operating performance, nor should they be considered as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities or other measurements under GAAP as indicators of liquidity. For additional information on how we calculate FFO and MFFO and a reconciliation of FFO and MFFO to net loss, see -Funds From Operations and Modified Funds From Operations.\u201d\nResults of Operations\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had indebtedness totaling an aggregate principal amount of $971,761,151, including the net discount on a note payable of $2,630,822 and the net deferred financing costs of $5,534,913. The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016: \nREIT Compliance\nEstimated Value per Share\nMFFO allow us to present our performance in a manner that reflects certain characteristics that are unique to public, non-listed REITs, such as their limited life, limited and defined acquisition period and targeted exit strategy, and hence that the use of such measures is useful to investors. By excluding expensed acquisition costs, the use of MFFO provides information consistent with management's analysis of the operating performance of the properties. Additionally, fair value adjustments, which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance. By excluding such changes that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gains or losses, we believe MFFO provides useful supplemental information.", "item_7_text": "Depreciation and Amortization\nWe record above-market and below-market in-place lease values for acquired properties based on the present value (using an interest rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (2) our estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease. We amortize any capitalized above-market or below-market lease values as a reduction or increase to rental income over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases.\nOperating, maintenance and management expenses\nReal estate taxes and insurance\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had not entered into any leases as a lessee.\n (1) At December 31, 2016, our portfolio was approximately 94.7% leased, calculated using the number of occupied and contractually leased units divided by total units. \nReal estate taxes and insurance expenses were $20,836,003 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $9,337,432 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $11,498,571 was due to the acquisition of four multifamily properties since December 31, 2015 and the continuing operation of the properties owned as of December 31, 2015. We expect these amounts may increase in future periods as a result of municipal property tax rate increases as well as increases in the assessed value of our property portfolio.\n____________________\nOperating, maintenance and management expenses were $35,644,845 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $18,480,708 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $17,164,137 was primarily due to operating 34 multifamily properties as of December 31, 2016 compared to 30 multifamily properties as of December 31, 2015. We expect that these amounts will decrease as a percentage of total revenues as we implement operational efficiencies at our multifamily properties.\nOur board of directors has declared daily distributions that are paid on a monthly basis. We expect to continue paying monthly distributions unless our results of operations, our general financial condition, general economic conditions or other factors prohibit us from doing so. We may declare distributions in excess of our FFO. As a result, our distribution rate and payment frequency may vary from time to time. However, to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, we must make distributions equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income\u201d each year.\n________________\n \u2022 $53,334,756 of cash used for improvements to real estate investments; \n\n \u2022 $116,100 of cash used to purchase interest rate cap agreements; and \nSame-store net operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $17,939,724 compared to $16,640,171 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The 7.8% increase in same-store net operating income was a result of a 6.6% increase in same-store rental revenues offset by a 4.9% increase in same-store operating expenses.\nOn February 1, 2017, we paid distributions of $3,808,938, which related to distributions declared for each day in the period from January 1, 2017 through January 31, 2017 and consisted of cash distributions paid in the amount of $1,813,252 and $1,995,686 in shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan.\nDepreciation and amortization\n________________\nOur results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are not indicative of those expected in future periods. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had not yet invested all of the proceeds from our initial public offering and therefore increased our borrowings and made acquisitions during the period, which had a significant impact on our future results of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had deployed the remaining offering proceeds and continued to perform value-enhancements projects, which had a significant impact on our results of operations. In general, we expect that our revenues and expenses related to our portfolio will increase in future periods as a result of organic rent increases and anticipated value-enhancement projects.\nOver the longer term, in addition to the same sources of capital we will rely on to meet our short-term liquidity requirements, we may also conduct additional public or private offerings of our securities. We expect these resources will be adequate to fund our operating activities, debt service and distributions, and will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operating activities as well as providing capital for investment in future development and other joint ventures along with potential forward purchase commitments.\nInterest expense\nWe account for our real estate assets in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, or ASC 360. ASC 360\n (1) By excluding expensed acquisition costs, management believes MFFO provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management's analysis of the investing and operating performance of our properties. Acquisition fees and expenses include payments to our advisor or third parties. Acquisition fees and expenses under GAAP are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income (loss) and income (loss) from continuing operations, both of which are performance measures under GAAP. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net \n\nDepreciation and amortization expenses were $42,438,760 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $5,316,510 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $37,122,250 was primarily due to the net increase in depreciable and amortizable assets of $867,876,870 since December 31, 2014.\nIntangible assets include the value of in-place leases, which represents the estimated value of the net cash flows of the in-place leases to be realized, as compared to the net cash flows that would have occurred had the property been vacant at the time of acquisition and subject to lease-up.\nRents and Other Receivables\nWe amortize the value of in-place leases to expense over the remaining non-cancelable term of the respective leases. Should a resident terminate its lease, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value and customer relationship intangibles would be charged to expense in that period.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we had a net loss of $37,682,474 compared to $50,694,124 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net loss of $13,011,650 over the comparable prior year period was primarily due to the increase in total revenues of $75,560,761, the decrease in acquisition costs of $4,887,998 and the decrease in fees to affiliates of $1,672,046, partially offset by the increase in operating, maintenance and management expenses of $17,164,137, the increase in real estate taxes and insurance of $11,498,571, the increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $25,552,783, the increase in interest expense of $12,784,551 and the increase in general and administrative expenses of $2,109,113. The increase in these expenses was primarily due to the increase in our property portfolio from 30 multifamily properties as of December 31, 2015 to 34 multifamily properties as of December 31, 2016.\nUse of Estimates\nHowever, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes general and administrative costs, interest expense, interest income and other expense, acquisition costs, certain fees to affiliates, depreciation and amortization expense and gains or losses from the sale of properties, and other gains and losses as stipulated by GAAP, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which are significant economic costs. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of net income which further limits its usefulness.\nNet Operating Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we had a net loss of $50,694,124 compared to $11,840,455 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in net loss of $38,853,669 over the comparable prior year period was primarily due to the increase in operating, maintenance and management expenses of $16,686,939, the increase in real estate taxes and insurance of $8,326,354, the increase in fees to affiliates of $20,623,305, the increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $37,122,250, the increase in interest expense of $11,685,756, the increase in general and administrative expenses of $1,069,517 and the increase in acquisition costs of $4,534,035, partially offset by the increase in total revenues of $61,194,487. The increase in these expenses was due primarily to the increase in our property portfolio from seven multifamily properties at December 31, 2014 to 30 multifamily properties at December 31, 2015.\nWhen recognized, organization costs are expensed as incurred. Offering costs, including selling commissions and dealer manager fees, are deferred and charged to stockholders' equity as such amounts are reimbursed to the advisor, the dealer manager or their affiliates from gross offering proceeds.\nTo the extent we did not pay the full sales commissions or dealer manager fee for shares sold in our initial public offering, we could also reimburse costs of training and education meetings held by us (primarily the travel, meal and lodging costs of registered representatives of broker-dealers), attendance and sponsorship fees and cost reimbursement of employees of our affiliates to attend seminars conducted by broker-dealers and, in certain cases, reimbursement to participating broker-dealers for technology costs associated with our initial public offering, costs and expenses related to such technology costs, and costs and expenses associated with the facilitation of the marketing of our shares and the ownership of our shares by such broker-dealers' customers. Through the termination of our initial public offering, underwriting compensation paid by us did not exceed 10% of the gross offering proceeds raised in our initial public offering.\nThe following table summarizes the consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nWe assess the acquisition-date fair values of all tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers (e.g., discounted cash flow analysis) and that utilize appropriate discount and/or capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it was vacant.\nSame-store revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $31,300,101 compared to $29,375,557 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The 6.6% increase in same-store revenues was primarily due to average rent increases at the same-store properties from $997 as of December 31, 2015 to $1,055 as of December 31, 2016, as a result of ordinary monthly rent increases and the completion of value-enhancement projects.\nFor purposes of evaluating comparative operating performance for the year, we categorize our properties as same-store\u201d or non-same-store.\u201d A same-store\u201d property is a property that was owned at January 1, 2015. A non-same-store\u201d property is a property that was acquired, placed into service or disposed of after January 1, 2015. As of December 31, 2016, seven properties were categorized as same-store properties.\na supplemental measure for publicly registered non-listed REITs and which we believe to be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a public, non-listed REIT having the characteristics described above. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate with a limited life and targeted exit strategy, as currently intended. We believe that, because MFFO excludes costs that we consider more reflective of investing activities and other non-operating items included in FFO and also excludes acquisition fees and expenses that affect our operations only in periods in which properties are acquired, MFFO can provide, on a going forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of our operating performance after the period in which we are acquiring our properties and once our portfolio is in place. By providing MFFO, we believe we are presenting useful information that assists investors and analysts to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our offering has been completed and our properties have been acquired. We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the non-listed REIT industry. Further, we believe MFFO is useful in comparing the sustainability of our operating performance after our offering and acquisitions are completed with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies that are not as involved in acquisition activities. Investors are cautioned that MFFO should only be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our offering has been completed and properties have been acquired, as it excludes acquisition costs that have a negative effect on our operating performance during the periods in which properties are acquired.\n \u2022 $2,156,699 of cash paid for the repurchase of common stock; and \n \u2022 equity capital from joint venture partners; and \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $269,344,362 compared to $910,962,748 during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of our acquisition of four multifamily properties during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 23 acquisitions of multifamily properties during the year ended December 31, 2015. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of the following:\nEstimates of the fair values of the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities require us to make significant assumptions to estimate market lease rates, property-operating expenses, carrying costs during lease-up periods, discount rates, market absorption periods, and the number of years the property will be held for investment. The use of inappropriate assumptions could result in an incorrect valuation of acquired tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities, which could impact the amount of our net income (loss).\nWe define FFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004, or the White Paper. The White Paper defines FFO as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property and non-cash impairment charges of real estate related investments, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. In particular, we believe it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges, as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations and assessments regarding general market conditions which can change over time. An asset will only be evaluated for impairment if certain impairment indications exist and if the carrying, or book value, exceeds the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows (including net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP) from such asset. Investors should note, however, that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows, are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and the relatively limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT's policy described above.\n \u2022 $40,588,872 of proceeds from issuance of mortgage notes payable, net of deferred financing costs in the amount of $1,005,250 and principal payments of $255,878; \nDistributions Declared\n (2) Other gains and losses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 include non-recurring insurance claim recoveries and other non-operating losses that are not included in NOI.  Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nDepreciation and amortization\nWe were formed on August 22, 2013, as a Maryland corporation that has elected to qualify as a REIT. We invest in and manage a diverse portfolio of multifamily properties located in targeted markets throughout the United States. In addition to our focus on multifamily properties, we may also make selective strategic acquisitions of other types of commercial properties. We may also acquire or originate mortgage, mezzanine, bridge and other real estate loans and equity securities of other real estate companies.\nOn January 3, 2017, we paid distributions of $3,788,605, which related to distributions declared for each day in the period from December 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and consisted of cash distributions paid in the amount of $1,796,334 and $1,992,271 in shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan.\nThe following table presents the same-store and non-same-store results from operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n (2) GAAP basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes real estate values diminish over time. In an effort to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate assets the Board of Governors of NAREIT established the measurement tool of FFO. Since its introduction, FFO has become a widely used non-GAAP financial measure among REITs. Additionally, we use MFFO, as defined by the Investment Program Association, as a supplemental measure to evaluate our operating performance. MFFO is \nOperating, maintenance and management expenses\nFees to affiliates were $26,301,919 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $5,678,614 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $20,623,305 was primarily due to acquisition fees and loan coordination fees of $10,067,980 and $6,593,644, respectively, earned by our advisor in connection with the acquisition of 23 multifamily properties with an aggregate contract purchase price of $960,595,000 and financing of 22 multifamily properties in the aggregate amount of $659,364,419 during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to acquisition fees and loan coordination fees of $2,954,149 and $1,969,306, respectively, earned by our advisor in connection with the acquisition and financing of seven multifamily properties with an aggregate contract purchase price of $274,564,250 and financing of $196,930,600 during the year ended December 31, 2014. Additionally, investment management and property management fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of the growth of our portfolio from seven multifamily properties owned as of December 31, 2014 to 30 multifamily properties owned as of December 31, 2015.\n \u2022 $570,108 of cash provided by restricted cash accounts related to replacement reserves; \n (3) Distributions are paid on a monthly basis. Distributions for all record dates of a given month are paid approximately three days following month end.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, we paid aggregate distributions of $41,132,852, including $19,252,136 of distributions paid in cash and 1,521,505 shares of our common stock issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan for $21,880,716. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our net loss was $37,682,474, we had FFO of $30,309,069 and net cash provided by operations of $38,939,853. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we funded $37,332,787, or 91%, of total distributions paid, including shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, from net cash provided by operating activities and $3,800,065, or 9%, from net public offering proceeds. Since inception, of the $60,352,790 in total distributions paid through December 31, 2016, including shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, 66% of such amounts were funded from cash flow from operations and 34% were funded from net public offering proceeds. For information on how we calculate FFO and the reconciliation of FFO to net loss, see -Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations.\u201d\nRelated-Party Transactions and Agreements\nTotal revenues\nPresentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors as they compare the operating performance to that of other public, non-listed REITs, although it should be noted that not all public, non-listed REITs calculate FFO and MFFO the same way, so comparisons with other public, non-listed REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with GAAP measurements as an indication of our performance. MFFO has limitations as a performance measure in an offering such as ours where the price of a share of common stock is a stated value and there is no regular net asset value determinations during the offering stage and for a period thereafter. MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and net asset value is disclosed. MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating net asset value because impairments are taken into account in determining net asset value but not in determining MFFO.\n \u2022 current unrestricted cash balance, which was $26,768,318 as of December 31, 2016; \n (2) Acquisition fees and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 include acquisition fees of $2,766,209, $10,067,980 and $2,954,149 and loan coordination fees of $1,539,500, $6,593,644 and $1,969,306, respectively, that are recorded in fees to affiliates in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Acquisition fees and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 also include acquisition expenses of $1,681,768, $6,569,766 and $2,035,731, respectively, that are recorded in acquisition costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  FFO and MFFO may be used to fund all or a portion of certain capitalizable items that are excluded from FFO and MFFO, such as tenant improvements, building improvements and deferred leasing costs.\nFees to affiliates were $24,629,873 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $26,301,919 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease of $1,672,046 was primarily due to the decrease in acquisition fees and loan coordination fees as a result of the acquisition of four multifamily properties during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the acquisition of 23 multifamily properties during the year ended December 31, 2015, partially offset by an increase in investment management and property management fees as a result of the growth of our portfolio. We expect fees to affiliates related to the on-going management of our real estate portfolio to increase in future periods as a result of increased property management fees from anticipated increases in future rental income. We expect fees to affiliates related to initial acquisition and financing activities to decrease in future periods as a result of the termination of the initial public offering and the decrease in anticipated future acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related investments.\nDuring times of economic downturn, market conditions could negatively impact the multifamily real estate sector, resulting in lower occupancy, lower rental rates and declining values. The economy in the United States has improved; however, there is no assurance that economic conditions will continue to improve or will not worsen in the future. We believe we currently have unique investment opportunities, particularly in the multifamily sector. Home ownership rates are the lowest they have been since 1967. Demographic and economic factors favor the flexibility of rental housing and discourage the potential financial burden associated with home ownership. Additionally, Millennials and Baby Boomers, the two largest demographic groups comprising roughly half of the total population in the United States, are increasingly choosing rental housing over home ownership. Our plan is to provide rental housing for these generational groups as they age. Millennials are getting married and having children later and are choosing to live in apartment communities until their mid-30s. Today, 30% of Millennials are still living with their parents or are still in school. When they get a job, Millennials will likely rent moderate income apartments based upon an average income of $35,000 to $55,000. We believe these factors will continue to contribute to the demand for multifamily housing.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nOn March 15, 2017, our board of directors approved and authorized a daily distribution to stockholders of record as of the close of business on each day of the period commencing on April 1, 2017 and ending on June 30, 2017. The distributions will be equal to $0.002466 per share of our common stock. The distributions for each record date in April 2017, May 2017 and June 2017 will be paid in May 2017, June 2017 and July 2017, respectively. The distributions will be payable to stockholders from legally available funds therefor.\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\n \u2022 borrowings under master repurchase agreements; \nDue to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, NAREIT, an industry trade group, has promulgated a measure known as FFO, which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. FFO is not equivalent to our net income (loss) as determined under GAAP.\nWe follow the income tax guidance under GAAP to recognize, measure, present and disclose in our consolidated financial statements uncertain tax positions that we have taken or expect to take on a tax return. As of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we did not have any liabilities for uncertain tax positions that we believe should be recognized in our consolidated financial statements. We have not been assessed interest or penalties by any major tax jurisdictions. Our evaluation was performed for all tax years through December 31, 2016.\nservice and loan to value requirements). The line of credit has a maturity date of May 17, 2019, subject to extension, as further described in the loan agreement entered into by certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries with PNC Bank in connection with the acquisition of the Landings of Brentwood property. As of December 31, 2016, $35,000,000 was outstanding on our line of credit. We have the option to select the interest rate in respect of the outstanding unpaid principal amount of the line of credit loans from the following options (1) the sum of the Base Rate (as defined in the loan agreement) plus 0.60% or (2) a rate per annum fixed for the applicable LIBOR Interest Period (as defined in the loan agreement) equal to the sum of LIBOR plus 1.60%. Monthly interest payments are due and payable in arrears on the first day of each month until the line of credit maturity date. The entire outstanding principal balance and any accrued and unpaid interest on the line of credit loans are due and payable in full on the line of credit maturity date. For additional information on our Line of Credit, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report. We continue to evaluate possible other sources of capital, including, without limitation, entering into additional credit facilities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such financing on favorable terms, if at all.\n\nOn May 18, 2016, we entered into a secured revolving line of credit facility, or the line of credit, with PNC Bank in an amount not to exceed $65,000,000. The line of credit provides for advances solely for the purpose of financing the costs in connection with acquisitions and development of real estate projects and for general corporate purposes (subject to certain debt\nNOI is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. NOI is used by investors and our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties, to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of our properties as it is not affected by (1) the cost of funds, (2) acquisition costs, (3) non-operating fees to affiliates, (4) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP or (5) general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses that are specific to us. The cost of funds is eliminated from net income (loss) because it is specific to our particular financing capabilities and constraints. The cost of funds is also eliminated because it is dependent on historical interest rates and other costs of capital as well as past decisions made by us regarding the appropriate mix of capital which may have changed or may change in the future. Acquisition costs and non-operating fees to affiliates are eliminated because they do not reflect continuing operating costs of the property owner.\n______________\nWe use secured borrowings, and intend to use in the future secured and unsecured borrowings. At December 31, 2016, our debt was approximately 58% of the value of our properties, as determined by an independent third-party appraiser. Going forward, we expect that our borrowings will be approximately 55% to 60% of the value of our properties (after debt amortization) and other real estate-related assets. For valuation purposes, the value of a property will equal the value determined by an independent qualified valuation expert. Under our charter, we are prohibited from borrowing in excess of 300% of the value of our net assets, which generally approximates to 75% of the aggregate cost of our assets, though we may exceed this limit only under certain circumstances.\nrequires us to continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of our real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability of the assets by estimating whether we will recover the carrying value of the asset through its undiscounted future cash flows and its eventual disposition. Based on this analysis, if we do not believe that we will be able to recover the carrying value of the real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities, we record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities. If any assumptions, projections or estimates regarding an asset changes in the future, we may have to record an impairment to reduce the net book value of such individual asset.\nThe following is a reconciliation of our NOI to net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 computed in accordance with GAAP:\nFees to affiliates\npremiums, audit fees, other professional fees and independent director compensation. The increase of $1,069,517 was primarily due to the acquisition of 23 multifamily properties during December 31, 2015 and the continuing operation of the properties owned as of December 31, 2014.\nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\n\nSubsequent Events\nOverview\nOn December 30, 2013, we commenced our initial public offering of up to 66,666,667 shares of common stock at an initial price of $15.00 per share and up to 7,017,544 shares of common stock pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan at an initial price of $14.25 per share. On March 24, 2016, we terminated our initial public offering. As of March 24, 2016, we had sold 48,625,651 shares of common stock for gross offering proceeds of $724,849,631, including 1,011,561 shares of common stock issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan for gross offering proceeds of $14,414,752. Following the termination of our initial public offering, we have continued to offer shares of our common stock pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. As of December 31, 2016, we had sold 49,835,344 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $742,287,907, including 2,221,317 shares of common stock issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan for gross offering proceeds of $31,853,028.\nSubject to certain restrictions and limitations, our advisor manages our day-to-day operations and our portfolio of properties and real estate-related assets. Our advisor sources and presents investment opportunities to our board of directors. Our advisor also provides investment management, marketing, investor relations and other administrative services on our behalf.\nOperating, maintenance and management expenses were $18,480,708 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1,793,769 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $16,686,939 was primarily due to operating 30 multifamily properties as of December 31, 2015 compared to seven multifamily properties as of December 31, 2014.\nIn addition to using our capital resources for investing purposes and meeting our debt obligations, we expect to use our capital resources to make certain payments to our advisor. We expect to make payments to our advisor in connection with the management of our asset portfolio and costs incurred by our advisor in providing services to us.\nWe record the acquisition of income-producing real estate or real estate that will be used for the production of income as a business combination. All assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at their acquisition-date fair values. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.\nIncome Taxes\nOn August 26, 2015, we entered into a revolving credit facility, or the credit facility, with PNC Bank, National Association or PNC Bank, in an amount not to exceed $200,000,000, which provides for advances to purchase properties or refinance existing properties from time to time (subject to certain debt service and loan to value requirements). The credit facility has a maturity date of September 1, 2020, subject to extension. The maximum amount that may be drawn under the credit facility may be increased up to $350,000,000 at any time during the period from January 1, 2016 to 12 months prior to the maturity date. Advances made under the credit facility will be secured by the property for which such advances are used. As of December 31, 2016, $186,300,000 was outstanding on our credit facility. Interest on the outstanding principal balances of advances accrue at the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus (1) the servicing spread of 0.05% and (2) the net spread, based on the debt service coverage ratio, of between 1.80% and 2.10%, as further described in the applicable notes. Monthly interest payments are due and payable on the first day of each month until the maturity date. The entire outstanding principal balance and any accrued and unpaid interest on all advances are due and payable in full on the maturity date. For additional information on our credit facility, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report.\nConsolidated Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\n \u2022 various forms of secured and unsecured financing; \nOn February 14, 2017, our board of directors determined an estimated value per share of our common stock of $14.85 as of December 31, 2016. See Item 5. Market For Registrant's Common Equity, Related Shareholders Matters and Purchases of Equity Securities - Estimated Value Per Share.\u201d In connection with the determination of an estimated value per share, our board of directors determined a price per share for our distribution reinvestment plan of $14.85, effective March 1, 2017. Distributions that accrue during the month of February 2017, which will be paid in March 2017, will be reinvested at $14.85 per share on the March distribution payment date pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $4,848,801 compared to $2,739,688 for the year ended December 31, 2015. These general and administrative costs consisted primarily of legal fees, insurance premiums, audit fees, other professional fees and independent director compensation. The increase of $2,109,113 was primarily due to the acquisition of four multifamily properties since December 31, 2015 and the continuing operation of the properties owned as of December 31, 2015. We expect general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of total revenues.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $2,739,688 compared to $1,670,171 for the year ended December 31, 2014. These general and administrative costs consisted primarily of legal fees, insurance\n \u2022 $35,000,000 of proceeds from borrowings from our line of credit; \n\nMarket Outlook\n (2) For information on how we calculate FFO and MFFO and a reconciliation of FFO and MFFO to net loss, see -Funds From Operations and Modified Funds From Operations.\u201d \nRevenues\nSubstantially all of our business is conducted through our operating partnership. We are the sole general partner of our operating partnership and one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is the only limited partner of our operating partnership. As we accepted subscriptions for shares of common stock, we transferred substantially all of the net proceeds of the initial public offering to our operating partnership as a capital contribution. The limited partnership agreement of our operating partnership provides that our operating partnership will be operated in a manner that will enable us to (1) satisfy the requirements for being classified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, (2) avoid any federal income or excise tax liability and (3) ensure that our operating partnership will not be classified as a publicly traded partnership\u201d for purposes of Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code, which classification could result in our operating partnership being taxed as a corporation, rather than as a disregarded entity. In addition to the administrative and operating costs and expenses incurred by our operating partnership in acquiring and operating our investments, our operating partnership will pay all of our administrative costs and expenses, and such expenses will be treated as expenses of our operating partnership.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $13,275,604 compared to $1,589,848 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $11,685,756 was primarily due to the net increase in the notes payable balance of $655,114,621 since December 31, 2014 due to financing incurred in connection with the acquisition of 22 multifamily properties during the year ended December 31, 2015. Included in interest expense is the amortization of deferred financing costs of $419,743 and $39,245, unrealized loss on derivative instruments of $2,554,041 and $578,014 and credit facility commitment fees of $30,254 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nWe will recognize gains on sales of real estate either in total or deferred for a period of time, depending on whether a sale has been consummated, the extent of the buyer's investment in the property being sold, whether the receivable is subject to future subordination, and the degree of our continuing involvement with the property after the sale. If the criteria for profit recognition under the full-accrual method are not met, we will defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the percentage-of-completion, reduced profit, deposit, installment or cost recovery method, as appropriate, until the appropriate criteria are met.\nRevenue Recognition\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\n \u2022 $7,092,300 of cash used for deposits for potential real estate investments; \nChanges in the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP (for acquisition fees and expenses from a capitalization/depreciation model to an expensed-as-incurred model) that were put into effect in 2009 and other changes to GAAP accounting for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition fees and expenses for all industries as items that are expensed under GAAP, that are typically accounted for as operating expenses. Management believes these fees and expenses do not affect our overall long-term operating performance. Publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation. While other start-up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, we believe that public, non-listed REITs, like us, are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after acquisition activity ceases. Our board of directors will determine to pursue a liquidity event when it believes that the then-current market conditions are favorable. However, our board of directors does not anticipate evaluating a liquidity event (i.e., listing of our common stock on a national exchange, a merger or sale of our company or another similar transaction) until five years after the completion of our offering stage. Thus, as a limited life REIT, we will not continuously purchase assets and will have a limited life.\nBelow is a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are critical because they involve significant judgments and assumptions, require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and because they are important for understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements. Other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.\nReal Estate Assets\nWe lease apartment homes under operating leases with terms generally of twelve months or less. Generally, credit investigations are performed for prospective residents and security deposits are obtained. We recognize minimum rent, including rental abatements, concessions and contractual fixed increases attributable to operating leases, on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease and amounts expected to be received in later years are recorded as deferred rents. We record property operating expense reimbursements due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes, and other recoverable costs in the period the related expenses are incurred.\nNeither the SEC, NAREIT nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and in response to such standardization we may have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO accordingly.\nOrganization and offering expenses included all expenses (other than sales commissions and the dealer manager fee) paid by us in connection with our initial public offering, including legal, accounting, tax, printing, mailing and filing fees, charges of our escrow agent and transfer agent, expenses of organizing our company, data processing fees, advertising and sales literature costs, transfer agent costs, out-of-pocket due diligence costs and amounts to reimburse our advisor or its affiliates for the salaries of its employees and other costs in connection with preparing supplemental sales materials and providing other administrative services in connection with our initial public offering. Any such reimbursement did not exceed actual expenses incurred by our advisor. Following the termination of our initial public offering, our advisor had an obligation to reimburse us to the extent total organization and offering expenses borne by us (including selling commissions and dealer manager fees) exceed 15% of the gross proceeds raised in our initial public offering. No amounts were owed to us by our advisor pursuant to the advisory agreement because total organization and offering expenses did not exceed 15% of the gross offering proceeds raised in our initial public offering.\nWe periodically evaluate the collectability of amounts due from residents and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of residents to make required payments under lease agreements. We exercise judgment in establishing these allowances and consider payment history and current credit status of residents in developing these estimates. Due to the short-term nature of the operating leases, we do not maintain a deferred rent receivable related to the straight-lining of rents. Other receivables include amounts due from the transfer agent for stock subscription net proceeds.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $26,060,155 compared to $13,275,604 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $12,784,551 was primarily due to the increase in the notes payable, net balance of $120,995,126 since December 31, 2015 due to financing incurred in connection with the acquisition of four multifamily properties since December 31, 2015. Included in interest expense is the amortization of deferred financing costs of $937,075 and $419,743, net, unrealized loss on derivative instruments of $270,222 and $2,554,041, amortization of loan discount of $90,718 and $0 and credit facility commitment fees of $65,302 and $30,254 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our interest expense in future periods will vary based on our level of future borrowings, which will depend on the availability and cost of debt financing and the opportunity to acquire real estate and real estate-related investments meeting our investment objectives.\n________________\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur calculation of FFO and MFFO is presented in the following table for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nderive a fair value measurement. Additionally, in an inactive market, a market price quoted from an independent third party may rely more on models with inputs based on information available only to that independent third party. When we determine the market for a financial instrument we own to be illiquid or when market transactions for similar instruments do not appear orderly, we use several valuation sources (including internal valuations, discounted cash flow analysis and quoted market prices) and we establish a fair value by assigning weights to the various valuation sources.\nTo qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which is computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP) to our stockholders. We must also meet certain asset and income tests, as well as other requirements. We monitor the operations and transactions that may potentially impact our REIT status. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates.\n \u2022 proceeds from our distribution reinvestment plan.  Over the short term, we believe that our sources of capital, specifically our cash balances, cash flow from operations, our ability to raise equity capital from joint venture partners and our ability to obtain various forms of secured and unsecured financing, including financing pursuant to our credit facility and line of credit each described below, will be adequate to meet our liquidity requirements and capital commitments.\n (1) Fees to affiliates for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016 exclude property management fees of $1,139,958 and $4,140,513 and other fees of $228,061 and $1,087,408, respectively, that are included in NOI. Fees to affiliates for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015 exclude property management fees of $805,411 and $1,987,517 and other fees of $224,683 and $584,060, respectively, that are included in NOI. Fees to affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2014 exclude property management fees of $206,552 and other fees of $75,779, that are included in NOI. \n______________\n____________________\nOur management uses MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate MFFO in order to evaluate our performance against other public, non-listed REITs which have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies shortly thereafter. As noted above, MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate in this manner. We believe that our use of MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate\nTo provide additional insight into our operating results, we are also providing a detailed analysis of same-store versus non-same-store NOI. For more information on NOI and a reconciliation of NOI (a non-GAAP financial measure) to net loss, see -Net Operating Income.\u201d\n (1) See -Net Operating Income\u201d below for a reconciliation of NOI to net loss.  Net Operating Income\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur Real Estate Portfolio\nAcquisition costs\nWith respect to other commercial properties, we expect in the future to include provisions in our leases designed to protect us from the impact of inflation. These provisions include reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements, or in some cases annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain allowance.\n________________\nReal estate taxes and insurance expenses were $9,337,432 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1,011,078 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $8,326,354 was due to the acquisition of 23 multifamily properties during the year ended December 31, 2015 and the continuing operation of the properties owned as of December 31, 2014.\nOverview\nFair Value Measurements\nSubstantially all of our multifamily property leases are for a term of one year or less. In an inflationary environment, this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Short-term leases generally will minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation, although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore will expose us to the effects of a decline in market rents. In a deflationary rent environment, we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter term leases.\nImpairment of Real Estate Assets\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n \u2022 $171,606,413 of cash provided by offering proceeds related to our public offering net of (1) payments of commissions on sales of common stock and related dealer manager fees in the amount of $16,862,099 and (2) the reimbursement of other offering costs to affiliates in the amount of $5,485,093; \nWe commenced real estate operations with the acquisition of our first multifamily property on May 22, 2014. As of December 31, 2016, we owned 34 multifamily properties. During the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $38,939,853 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $3,258,965 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The change in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to increases in depreciation and amortization and restricted cash partially offset by a decrease in net loss, amounts due to affiliates and accounts payable and accrued liabilities associated with 34 multifamily properties owned as of December 31, 2016, compared to the 30 multifamily properties owned as of December 31, 2015. We expect to continue to generate cash flows from operations as we stabilize the operations of our property portfolio and complete our value-enhancement program.\nDue to the above factors and other unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the Investment Program Association, or IPA, an industry trade group, has standardized a measure known as MFFO, which the IPA has recommended as\nDistributions Paid\nReview of our Policies\nNet loss\n (2) Assumes each share was issued and outstanding each day during the period presented. \nInterest expense\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $225,786,450 compared to $917,012,264 during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities is due primarily to the decrease in proceeds from issuance of mortgage notes payable, borrowings from credit facilities and issuance of common stock from $404,655,500, $186,300,000 and $382,566,638, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2015 to $41,850,000, $35,000,000 and $193,953,605, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2016. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of the following:\n Level 2: quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and \nDepreciation and amortization expenses were $67,991,543 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $42,438,760 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $25,552,783 was primarily due to the net increase in depreciable and amortizable assets of $263,656,918 since December 31, 2015. We expect these amounts to increase slightly in future periods as a result of anticipated future enhancements to our real estate portfolio.\nOur principal demand for funds will be to fund value-enhancement and other capital improvement projects, to pay operating expenses and interest on our outstanding indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. Over time, we intend to generally fund our cash needs, other than asset acquisitions, from operations. Otherwise, we expect that our principal sources of working capital will include:\nWe have entered into agreements with our advisor and its affiliates, whereby we pay certain fees to, or reimburse certain expenses of, our advisor or its affiliates for acquisition and advisory fees and expenses, financing coordination fees, organization and offering costs, sales commissions, dealer manager fees, asset and property management fees and expenses, leasing fees and reimbursement of certain operating costs. See Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, Director Independence\u201d and Note 7 (Related Party Arrangements) to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a discussion of the various related-party transactions, agreements and fees.\nOur MFFO calculation complies with the IPA's Practice Guideline described above. In calculating MFFO, we exclude acquisition related expenses, amortization of above and below market leases, fair value adjustments of derivative financial instruments, deferred rent receivables and the adjustments of such items related to noncontrolling interests. Under GAAP, acquisition fees and expenses are characterized as operating expenses in determining operating net income. These expenses are paid in cash by us. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property. In the event that proceeds from our offerings of shares are not available to fund our reimbursement of acquisition fees and expenses incurred by our advisor, such fees and expenses will need to be reimbursed to our advisor from other sources, including debt, operational earnings or cash flow, net proceeds from the sale of properties, or from ancillary cash flows. The acquisition of properties, and the corresponding acquisition fees and expenses, is the key operational feature of our business plan to generate operational income and cash flow to fund distributions to our stockholders. Further, under GAAP, certain contemplated non-cash fair value and other non-cash adjustments are considered operating non-cash adjustments to net income in determining cash flow from operating activities. In addition, we view fair value adjustments of derivatives and gains and losses from dispositions of assets as non-recurring items or items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized, and which are not reflective of on-going operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance.\nNOI is a measure of the operating performance of our properties but does not measure our performance as a whole. NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income (loss) as computed in accordance with GAAP. This measure should be analyzed in conjunction with net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP and discussions elsewhere in -Results of Operations\u201d regarding the components of net income (loss) that are eliminated in the calculation of NOI. Other companies may use different methods for calculating NOI or similarly entitled measures and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies that do not define the measure exactly as we do.\nTotal revenues were $144,010,514 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $68,449,753 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $75,560,761 was primarily due to operating 34 multifamily properties at December 31, 2016 compared to 30 multifamily properties at December 31, 2015. Additionally, our total units increased by 1,743 from 9,858 at December 31, 2015 to 11,601 at December 31, 2016. Average monthly rents per unit increased from $1,037 as of December 31, 2015 to $1,102 as of December 31, 2016. We expect rental income and tenant reimbursements to increase in future periods as a result of ordinary monthly rent increases, improved occupancy and the implementation of our value-enhancement strategy.\n\n (1) For information on how we calculate NOI and a reconciliation of NOI to net loss, see -Net Operating Income.\u201d \n\n (2) Average monthly rent is based upon the effective rental income after considering the effect of vacancies, concessions and write-offs. \n \u2022 $658,886 of cash provided by proceeds from insurance claims.  Cash Flows from Financing Activities\nWe amortize the fair value of stock-based compensation awards to expense over the vesting period and record any dividend equivalents earned as dividends for financial reporting purposes. Stock-based compensation awards are valued at the fair value on the date of grant and amortized as an expense over the vesting period.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe use secured debt, and intend to use in the future secured and unsecured debt. We believe that the careful use of borrowings will help us achieve our diversification goals and potentially enhance the returns on our investments. At December 31, 2016, our debt was approximately 58% of the value of our properties, as determined by an independent third-party appraiser. Going forward, we expect that our borrowings will be approximately 55% to 60% of the value of our properties (after debt amortization) and other real estate-related assets. For valuation purposes, the value of a property will equal the value determined by an independent third-party appraiser or qualified independent valuation expert. Under our charter, we are prohibited from borrowing in excess of 300% of our net assets, which generally approximates to 75% of the aggregate cost of our assets unless such excess is approved by a majority of the independent directors and disclosed to stockholders, along with a justification for such excess, in our next quarterly report. In such event, we will monitor our debt levels and take action to reduce any such excess as practicable. Our aggregate borrowings are reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly. As of December 31, 2016, our aggregate borrowings were not in excess of 300% of the value of our net assets.\nOn March 1, 2017, we paid distributions of $3,445,424, which related to distributions declared for each day in the period from February 1, 2017 through February 28, 2017 and consisted of cash distributions paid in the amount of $1,646,144 and $1,799,280 in shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan.\nWe define MFFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, consistent with the IPA's Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations, or the Practice Guideline, issued by the IPA in November 2010. The Practice Guideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for the following items, as applicable, included in the determination of GAAP net income: acquisition fees and expenses; amounts relating to deferred rent receivables and amortization of above and below market leases and liabilities (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to a cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments); accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income; nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. The accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments, nonrecurring unrealized gains and losses on hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings, unrealized gains and losses resulting from consolidations, as well as other listed cash flow adjustments are adjustments made to net income in calculating the cash flows provided by operating activities and, in some cases, reflect gains or losses which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized. While we rely on our Advisor for managing interest rate, hedge and foreign exchange risk, we do not retain an outside consultant to review all our hedging agreements. Inasmuch as interest rate hedges are not a fundamental part of our operations, we believe it is appropriate to exclude such non-recurring gains and losses in calculating MFFO, as such gains and losses are not reflective of on-going operations.\nTotal revenues\nWe estimate the value of resident origination and absorption costs by considering the estimated carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, considering current market conditions. In estimating carrying costs, we estimate the amount of lost rentals using market rates during the expected lease-up periods.\n Level 1: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities; \nReal Estate Purchase Price Allocation\nOn March 24, 2016, our board of directors determined an estimated value per share of our common stock of $14.46 as of December 31, 2015. On February 14, 2017, our board of directors determined an estimated value per share of our common stock of $14.85 as of December 31, 2016. For more information on the determination of the estimated value per share of our common stock, see Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Purchases of Equity Securities - Estimated Value Per Share.\u201d In connection with the determination of our estimated value per share, on March 24, 2016 and on February 14, 2017, our board of directors increased the purchase price of shares offered pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan to $14.85 and $14.46, effective March 1, 2017 and May 1, 2016, respectively. In the future, our board of directors may, in its sole discretion and from time to time, change the price at which we offer shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan to reflect changes in our estimated value per share and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.\nTotal revenues were $68,449,753 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $7,255,266 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $61,194,487 was primarily due to operating 30 multifamily properties at December 31, 2015 compared to seven multifamily properties at December 31, 2014. Additionally, our total units increased by 7,363 from 2,495 at December 31, 2014 to 9,858 at December 31, 2015. Average monthly rents per unit increased from $884 as of December 31, 2014 to $1,037 as of December 31, 2015.\nFees to affiliates\nNet loss\n\n (2) Projected principal payments on outstanding debt obligations are based on the terms of the notes payable agreements. Amounts exclude the amortization of the debt discount and net deferred financing costs associated with certain notes payable. \nConsolidated Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nThe distributions declared and paid for the four fiscal quarters of 2016, along with the amount of distributions reinvested pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, were as follows:\nIn addition to making investments in accordance with our investment objectives, we use our capital resources to make certain payments to our advisor and its affiliates. During our organization and offering stage, we made payments to the dealer manager for sales commissions and the dealer manager fees and payments to our advisor for reimbursement of certain organization and offering expenses. Currently, during our operating stage, we make payments to our advisor in connection with the acquisition of investments, the management of our assets and costs incurred by our advisor in providing services to us.\n (1) NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure used by investors and our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties and to determine trends in earnings. However, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes general and administrative costs, interest expense, interest income and other expense, acquisition costs, certain fees to affiliates, depreciation and amortization expense and gains or losses from the sale of our properties and other gains and losses as stipulated by GAAP, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs, all of which are significant economic costs. For additional information on how we calculate NOI and a reconciliation of NOI to net loss, see -Net Operating Income.\u201d \nChanges in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these estimated fair values. In this regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument.\nSame-store operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $13,360,377 compared to $12,735,386 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in same-store operating expenses was primarily attributable to a net increase in property taxes across the same-store properties.\nProperty Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nInflation\nReal estate taxes and insurance\nAcquisition costs\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent that we distribute qualifying dividends to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year in which qualification is lost, unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Failing to qualify as a REIT could materially and adversely affect our net income and results of operations.\nsales proceeds from the disposition of properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to the property. In the event that proceeds from our public offering are not available to fund our reimbursement of acquisition fees and expenses incurred by our advisor, such fees and expenses will need to be reimbursed to the advisor from other sources, including debt, operational earnings or cash flow, net proceeds from the sale of properties, or from ancillary cash flows. The acquisition of properties, and the corresponding acquisition fees and expenses, is the key operational feature of our business plan to generate operational income and cash flow to fund distributions to its stockholders.\n \u2022 $19,252,136 of net cash distributions to our stockholders, after giving effect to distributions reinvested by stockholders of $21,880,716.  Contractual Commitments and Contingencies\n \u2022 $210,030,200 of cash used related to the acquisition of four multifamily properties; \n (1) Projected interest payments on outstanding debt obligations are based on the outstanding principal amounts and interest rates in effect at December 31, 2016. We incurred interest expense of $26,060,155 during the year ended December 31, 2016, including amortization of deferred financing costs totaling $937,075, net unrealized losses from the change in fair value of interest rate cap agreements of $270,222, amortization of loan discount of $90,718 and credit facility commitment fees of $65,302. \nUnder GAAP, we are required to measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis. In addition, we are required to measure other assets and liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis (e.g., carrying value of impaired real estate loans receivable and long-lived assets). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The GAAP fair value framework uses a three-tiered approach. Fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\nAs of December 31, 2016, we owned the 34 multifamily apartment communities listed below: \nDistributions\nOrganization and Offering Costs\n (1) Distributions during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were based on daily record dates and calculated at a rate of $0.002459 and $0.002466 per share per day, respectively. \nAcquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $1,681,768 compared to $6,569,766 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease of $4,887,998 was primarily due to the acquisition of four multifamily properties with an aggregate contract purchase price of $264,222,500 during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the acquisition of 23 multifamily properties with an aggregate contract purchase price of $960,595,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015. We do not expect to incur significant acquisition costs in future periods as we have invested all of the proceeds from our initial public offering.\n Level 3: prices or valuation techniques where little or no market data is available that requires inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.  When available, we utilize quoted market prices from an independent third-party source to determine fair value and will classify such items in Level 1 or Level 2. In instances where the market is not active, regardless of the availability of a non-binding quoted market price, observable inputs might not be relevant and could require us to make a significant adjustment to\nDepreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets are eliminated because they may not accurately represent the actual change in value in our multifamily properties that result from use of the properties or changes in market conditions. While certain aspects of real property do decline in value over time in a manner that is reasonably captured by depreciation and amortization, the value of the properties as a whole have historically increased or decreased as a result of changes in overall economic conditions instead of from actual use of the property or the passage of time. Gains and losses from the sale of real property vary from property to property and are affected by market conditions at the time of sale which will usually change from period to period. These gains and losses can create distortions when comparing one period to another or when comparing our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies that have not made similarly timed purchases or sales. We believe that eliminating these costs from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating our properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.\nOperating Expenses\nReal estate costs related to the development, construction and improvement of properties are capitalized. Acquisition costs related to business combinations are expensed as incurred. Acquisition costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized. Repair and maintenance and tenant turnover costs are charged to expense as incurred and significant replacements and betterments are capitalized. Repair and maintenance and tenant turnover costs include all costs that do not extend the useful life of the real estate asset. We consider the period of future benefit of an asset to determine its appropriate useful life and anticipate the estimated useful lives of assets by class to be generally as follows:\n (3) Mortgage debt outstanding is net of deferred financing costs and loan discount associated with the loans for each individual property listed above but excludes the principal balance of $35,000,000 and associated deferred financing costs of $853,652 related to the revolving credit facilities at the Company level.  During 2016, we acquired four properties for an aggregate contract purchase price of $264,222,500, exclusive of closing costs.\nThe following table summarizes the consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code and have operated as such commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2014. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders (which is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP). As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we distribute qualifying dividends to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost, unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. However, we believe we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a REIT.\nThe discussion that follows is based on our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The ability to compare one period to another is significantly affected by acquisitions completed during those periods in addition to the implementation of our value-enhancement strategy. As of December 31, 2016, we owned 34 multifamily properties compared to 30 multifamily properties at December 31, 2015. The increase in our property portfolio is the primary cause of the increases in operating income and expenses, as further discussed below.\nThe historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, especially if such assets are not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances and/or as requested or required by lessees for operational purposes in order to maintain the value disclosed. We believe that since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation may be less informative. Historical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate related depreciation and amortization, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income. However, FFO, and MFFO as described below, should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP FFO and MFFO measures and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO.\nOur long-term policy is to pay distributions solely from cash flow from operations. Because we may receive income from interest or rents at various times during our fiscal year and because we may need cash flow from operations during a particular period to fund capital expenditures and other expenses, we expect that from time to time during our operational stage, we will declare distributions in anticipation of cash flow that we expect to receive during a later period, and we expect to pay these distributions in advance of our actual receipt of these funds. In these instances, our board of directors has the authority under our organizational documents, to the extent permitted by Maryland law, to fund distributions from sources such as borrowings, offering proceeds or advances and the deferral of fees and expense reimbursements by our advisor, in its sole discretion. We have not established a limit on the amount of proceeds we may use from sources other than cash flow from operations to fund distributions. If we pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, we will have fewer funds available for investments.\nAcquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $6,569,766 compared to $2,035,731 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $4,534,035 was due primarily to the acquisition of 23 multifamily properties with an aggregate contract purchase price of $960,595,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the acquisition of seven multifamily properties with an aggregate contract purchase price of $274,564,250 during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data\u201d above and our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report. Also see Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\u201d preceding Part I.\nOur board of directors, including our independent directors, has reviewed our policies described in this annual report, including policies regarding our investments, leverage and conflicts of interest, and determined that the policies are in the best interests of our stockholders.\nDistributions declared (1) accrued daily to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on each day, (2) were payable in cumulative amounts on or before the third day of each calendar month with respect to the prior month and (3) were calculated at a rate of $0.002466 per share per day during the year ended December 31, 2015, which if paid each day over a 365-day period is equivalent to a 6.0% annualized distribution rate based on a purchase price of $15.00 per share of common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2016, distributions declared were calculated at a rate of $0.002459 per share per day, which if paid over a 366-day period is equivalent to a 6.0% annualized distribution rate based on a purchase price of $15.00 per share of common stock.\nbased on FFO but includes certain adjustments we believe are necessary due to changes in accounting and reporting under GAAP since the establishment of FFO. Neither FFO nor MFFO should be considered as alternatives to net loss or other measurements under GAAP as indicators of our operating performance, nor should they be considered as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities or other measurements under GAAP as indicators of liquidity. For additional information on how we calculate FFO and MFFO and a reconciliation of FFO and MFFO to net loss, see -Funds From Operations and Modified Funds From Operations.\u201d\nResults of Operations\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had indebtedness totaling an aggregate principal amount of $971,761,151, including the net discount on a note payable of $2,630,822 and the net deferred financing costs of $5,534,913. The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016: \nREIT Compliance\nEstimated Value per Share\nMFFO allow us to present our performance in a manner that reflects certain characteristics that are unique to public, non-listed REITs, such as their limited life, limited and defined acquisition period and targeted exit strategy, and hence that the use of such measures is useful to investors. By excluding expensed acquisition costs, the use of MFFO provides information consistent with management's analysis of the operating performance of the properties. Additionally, fair value adjustments, which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance. By excluding such changes that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gains or losses, we believe MFFO provides useful supplemental information.", "item_7_tables": "Table 151: <table><tr><td> </td>
