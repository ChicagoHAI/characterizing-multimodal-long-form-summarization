Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is management's discussion of the financial results, liquidity and other key items related to our performance. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those indicated in forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A - Risk Factors.\u201d\nBusiness Overview\nCentral Garden & Pet Company is a leading innovator, producer and distributor of branded and private label products for the lawn & garden and pet supplies markets in the United States.\nIn fiscal 2021, our consolidated net sales were $3.3 billion, of which our Pet segment, or Pet, accounted for approximately $1.9 billion and our Garden segment, or Garden, accounted for approximately $1.4 billion. In fiscal 2021, our operating income was $254 million consisting of income from our Pet segment of $208 million, income from our Garden segment of $139 million and corporate expenses of $93 million.\nFiscal 2021 Financial Highlights\nFinancial summary:\n\u2022Net sales for fiscal 2021 increased $608.2 million, or 22.6%, to $3,303.7 million, with organic net sales increasing $335.3 million and sales from our four recent acquisitions of $272.9 million. Our Pet segment sales increased 12.9%, and our Garden segment sales increased 38.5%.\n\u2022Gross profit for fiscal 2021 increased $174.3 million, or 21.9%, to $970.9 million. Gross margin declined 20 basis points in fiscal 2021 to 29.4%, from 29.6% in fiscal 2020.\n\u2022Our operating income increased $56.5 million, or 28.5%, to $254.5 million in fiscal 2021, and as a percentage of net sales improved to 7.7% from 7.3% in fiscal 2020.\n\u2022Net income for fiscal 2021 was $151.7 million, or $2.75 per share on a diluted basis, compared to net income in fiscal 2020 of $120.7 million, or $2.20 per share on a diluted basis.\nRecent Developments\nFiscal Year 2021 Acquisitions\nD&D Commodities\nOn June 30, 2021, the Company purchased D&D Commodities, Ltd. (\"D&D\"), a provider of high-quality, premium bird feed, for approximately $88 million in cash and the assumption of approximately $30 million of long-term debt. The addition of D&D expands Central's portfolio in the bird feed category and is expected to deepen the Company's relationship with major retailers.\nGreen Garden Products\nOn February 11, 2021, the Company acquired Flora Parent, Inc. and its subsidiaries (\"Green Garden Products\"), a leading provider of vegetable, herb and flower seed packets, seed starters and plant nutrients in North America, for approximately $571 million. The addition of Green Garden Products expands the Company's portfolio into an adjacent garden category.\nHopewell Nursery\nOn December 31, 2020, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets of Hopewell Nursery, a leading live goods wholesale grower serving retail nurseries, landscape contractors, wholesalers and garden centers across the Northeast, for approximately $81 million. The addition of Hopewell Nursery to the Central portfolio strengthens the Company's position as a leading live goods provider in the garden category.\nDoMyOwn\nOn December 18, 2020, the Company acquired DoMyOwn, a leading online retailer of professional-grade control products, for approximately $81 million. The acquisition strengthens the Company's position in the control products category and adds a leading online platform for eCommerce fulfillment and digital capabilities.\nChange in Segment Components\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we began reporting the results of our outdoor cushion operations in the Pet segment as a result of a change in internal management reporting lines due to potential synergies in sourcing, manufacturing and innovation and to be consistent with the reporting of financial information used to assess performance and allocate resources. These operations were previously reported in the Garden segment and are now managed and reported in the Pet segment. All prior period segment disclosures have been recast to reflect this segment change.\nCOVID-19 Impact\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has led to adverse impacts on human health, the global economy and society at large. From the beginning, our priority has been the safety of our employees, customers and consumers.\nCentral has been impacted by COVID-19 in a number of ways, including increased demand evidenced by our organic net sales increase of 13% in fiscal year 2021. The increased demand for our products continues to challenge our supply chain and our ability to procure and manufacture enough product to meet the continued high levels of demand. At some of our facilities, we have experienced reduced productivity and increased employee absences, which we expect to continue during the balance of the pandemic. Our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are currently open and fully operational. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs including personal protective equipment and sanitation costs. We have hosted mobile vaccination clinics at some of our larger manufacturing and distribution sites, in order to make vaccines available to our employees.\nThe pandemic and related increase in demand have created operational challenges, which have impacted our service and fill rates. In our supply chain, we may continue to experience increased operational and logistics costs. We may also experience additional disruptions in our supply chain as the pandemic continues, although we cannot reasonably estimate the potential impact or timing of those events, and we may not be able to mitigate such impact. We continue to face supply constraints of commodities, material and freight and the limited availability of labor and inflationary pressures stemming from the COVID-19 operating environment, including notable increases in costs for key commodities, material, labor and freight.\nWe believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs with our cash and revolving credit facility as we manage through the current economic and health environment.\nThe volatility in demand, changing consumer consumption patterns, uncertainty regarding vaccination uptake and new variants of the virus make it difficult to predict when more normal order patterns may return. Forecasting and planning remain challenging in the current environment and will continue to be challenging as the pandemic eases in the future. In the current uncertain environment, our employees, customers and consumers will continue to be our priority as we manage our business to deliver long-term growth.\nResults of Operations (GAAP)\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the relative percentages that certain income and expense items bear to net sales: Table 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>September 25, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>September 26, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>September 28, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold and occupancy </td> <td> </td> <td>70.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>29.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative </td> <td> </td> <td>21.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.4) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td>1.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020\nNet Sales\nNet sales for fiscal 2021 increased $608.2 million, or 22.6%, to $3,303.7 million from $2,695.5 million in fiscal 2020. Organic net sales, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures in the last 12 months, increased $335.3 million, or 12.5% in fiscal 2021. Branded product sales increased $459.8 million, and sales of other manufacturers' products increased $148.4 million. Branded product sales include products we produce under Central brand names and products we produce under third-party brands. Sales of branded products represented 77% of our total sales in fiscal 2021 compared with 78% in fiscal 2020. Private label sales represent approximately 10% to 15% of our consolidated net sales.\nThe following table indicates each class of similar products which represented approximately 10% or more of our consolidated net sales in the fiscal years presented: Table 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Category </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other pet products </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>767.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>821.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>688.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other garden products </td> <td> </td> <td>876.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>491.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>485.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other manufacturers' products </td> <td> </td> <td>749.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>600.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>504.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dog & cat products </td> <td> </td> <td>570.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>502.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>452.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wild bird </td> <td> </td> <td>340.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Controls & fertilizer products </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td>279.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>252.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,303.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,695.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,383.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The product category was less than 10% of our consolidated net sales in the period.\nPet net sales increased $216.9 million, or 12.9%, to $1,894.9 million in fiscal 2021 from $1,678.0 million in fiscal 2020. Net sales in the prior year include sales from the Breeder's Choice business unit which we sold in December 2020. Organic net sales increased $235.8 million, or 14.2%, as compared to the prior year. The sales increase was broad-based across our entire Pet portfolio and we continue to see increased demand due, among other things, to increased pet ownership of dogs, cats, small animals and reptiles during the pandemic. Organic sales gains were most significant in our dog and cat, sales of other manufacturers' products, and outdoor cushion businesses. The organic sales increase was primarily volume driven but price increases did have a more limited positive impact. Pet branded sales increased $176.3 million and sales of other manufacturers' products increased $40.6 million.\nGarden net sales increased $391.3 million, or 38.5%, to $1,408.8 million in fiscal 2021 from $1,017.5 million in fiscal 2020. Organic sales increased $99.5 million, or 9.8%, and sales from our recent acquisitions of DoMyOwn, Hopewell Nursery, Green Garden Products and D&D Commodities contributed $291.8 million. The increased organic sales were broad-based across our entire Garden portfolio, including sales increases in sales of other manufacturers' products, wild bird feed, live plants and controls and fertilizers. We believe the sales increase across our Garden portfolio was driven in significant part by increased consumer home gardening related to the pandemic and retailer listing gains. The organic sales increase was primarily volume driven but was also aided by price increases necessitated by the current inflationary cost environment, especially in our wild bird feed business. Garden branded sales increased $283.5 million and sales of other manufacturers' products increased $107.8 million.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for fiscal 2021 increased $174.3 million, or 21.9%, to $970.9 million from $796.6 million in fiscal 2020. Both Garden and Pet contributed to the increase in gross profit. The decline in gross margin was due to significant cost inflation and the impact of inventory-related purchase accounting which was largely offset by price increases and productivity gains. Both segments are being impacted by the rapidly increasing cost environment where we are seeing widespread inflation across commodities (e.g., sunflower, milo, millet and foam), freight and labor. We intend to seek price increases to offset continued inflationary pressures but do not anticipate we will be able to fully offset the cost pressures in fiscal 2022.\nIn the Pet segment, gross profit increased due to increased sales, favorable product mix and productivity gains, partially offset by significant inflationary headwinds.\nIn the Garden segment, gross profit increased due to increased sales, including the inorganic contribution of the four recent acquisitions and gross productivity efforts, partially offset by heightened costs across commodities, freight and labor.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $117.8 million, or 19.7%, from $598.6 million in fiscal 2020 to $716.4 million in fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 22.2% in fiscal 2020 to 21.7% in fiscal 2021; both the Pet segment and corporate contributed to the improvement. Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales increased in the Garden segment due to the four fiscal 2021 acquisitions which include the amortization of the intangible assets resulting from purchase accounting. Corporate expenses are included within administrative expense and relate to the costs of unallocated executive, administrative, finance, legal, human resource, and information technology functions.\nSelling and delivery expense increased $61.5 million, or 20.4%, to $363.7 million in fiscal 2021 but decreased as a percentage of net sales from 11.2% in fiscal 2020 to 11.0% in fiscal 2021. The increase in selling and delivery expense was due primarily to the addition of our four fiscal 2021 acquisitions, increased delivery expense resulting from increased sales volumes and higher shipping costs, and increased headcount and marketing investments for market research, brand development and innovation. The decline in selling and delivery expense as a percentage of net sales was due primarily to improved overhead absorption.\nWarehouse and administrative expense increased $56.3 million, or 19.0%, to $352.7 million in fiscal 2021 and decreased as a percentage of net sales to 10.7% in fiscal 2021 from 11.0% in fiscal 2020. The increased expense was driven by the addition of the four recent acquisitions in the Garden segment and a $2.6 million loss in our Pet segment resulting from the sale of the Breeder's Choice business in our fiscal 2021 first quarter. Additionally, both operating segments experienced increased labor and payroll-related expense from wage inflation. Corporate expenses increased $3.6 million due primarily to increased variable compensation, payroll expense and increased non-cash equity compensation expense.\nOperating Income\nOperating income increased $56.5 million, or 28.5%, to $254.5 million in fiscal 2021 from $198.0 million in fiscal 2020. Our operating margin was 7.7% in fiscal 2021, increasing from 7.3% in fiscal 2020. Increased sales of $608.2 million and a 50 basis point decrease in selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales were partially offset by a 20 basis point decline in gross margin. Both operating income and margin were favorably impacted by significant pandemic-related increases in demand for our products.\nPet operating income increased $36.8 million, or 21.5%, to $208.2 million in fiscal 2021 from $171.4 million for fiscal 2020. Pet operating income increased due to higher sales and gross profit partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expense. Pet operating margin improved 80 basis points due to increased sales, an improved gross margin and lower selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales.\nGarden operating income increased $23.3 million, or 20.2%, to $138.8 million for fiscal 2021. The increase was due to increased sales and higher gross profit partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses. Garden operating margin declined 150 basis points to 9.8% due primarily to higher selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales and the initial inventory-related impact of purchase accounting from our four recent acquisitions.\nCorporate expenses increased $3.6 million due primarily to increased variable compensation, payroll expense and increased non-cash equity compensation expense.\nNet Interest Expense\nNet interest expense increased $18.2 million, or 45.5%, from $40.0 million in fiscal 2020 to $58.2 million in fiscal 2021. In October 2020, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due October 2030 and used the proceeds to redeem all of our outstanding aggregate principal amount 6.125% senior notes due 2023 with the remainder available for general corporate purposes. As a result of our redemption of the 2023 Notes, we recognized incremental interest expense of approximately $10.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Also contributing to the increase in net interest expense was a higher debt balance during fiscal 2021. In April 2021, we issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due April 2031. We used a portion of the net proceeds to repay outstanding amounts under our senior secured revolving credit facility, with the remainder available for general corporate purposes.\nDebt outstanding on September 25, 2021 was $1,185.8 million compared to $694.1 million as of September 26, 2020. Our average borrowing rate for fiscal 2021 was 4.4% and for fiscal 2020 was 5.6%.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) is comprised of income or loss from investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting, including any associated impairments of investments and foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Other expense was $1.5 million for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021 compared to $4.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 26, 2020, due primarily to a $3.6 million impairment in fiscal 2020 of two investments in private companies impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective income tax rate was 21.6% for fiscal 2021 compared to 21.0% for fiscal 2020. The increased effective income tax rate in fiscal 2021 was due primarily to a decrease in benefit from income tax credits and an increase in taxable foreign earnings.\nNet Income and Earnings Per Share\nOur net income for fiscal 2021 was $151.7 million, or $2.75 per diluted share, compared to $120.7 million, or $2.20 per diluted share, for fiscal 2020. The fiscal 2021 25.0% improvement in earnings per diluted share was due to strong revenue growth and operating margin improvement.\nFiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019\nFor a discussion of our results of operations in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, please see Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 26, 2020 filed with the SEC.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). However, to supplement the financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EBITDA, organic sales; and non-GAAP net income and diluted net income per share. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of specific items (described below) may be useful to investors in their assessment of our ongoing operating performance and provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined by us as income before income tax, net other expense, net interest expense and depreciation and amortization (or operating income plus depreciation and amortization expense). We present adjusted EBITDA because we believe that adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplemental measure in evaluating the cash flows and performance of our business and provides greater transparency into our results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA is used by our management to perform such evaluation. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for cash flow from operations, income from operations or other income statement measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies, many of which present adjusted EBITDA when reporting their results. Other companies may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently and it may not be comparable.\nWe have also provided organic net sales, a non-GAAP measure that excludes the impact of businesses purchased or exited in the prior 12 months, because we believe it permits investors to better understand the performance of our historical business without the impact of recent acquisitions or dispositions.\nThe reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are shown in the tables below. We believe that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and other users of our financial statements, by allowing for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operating performance. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating our performance, and we believe these measures similarly may be useful to investors in evaluating our financial and operating performance and the trends in our business from management's point of view. While our management believes that non-GAAP measurements are useful supplemental information, such adjusted results are not intended to replace our GAAP financial results and should be read in conjunction with those GAAP results.\nNon-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items:\n\u2022Incremental expenses from note redemption and issuance: we have excluded the impact of the incremental expenses incurred from the note redemption and issuance as they represent an infrequent transaction that occurs in limited circumstances that impacts the comparability between operating periods. We believe the adjustment of these expenses supplements the GAAP information with a measure that may be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance.\n\u2022Loss on sale of business: we have excluded the impact of the loss on the sale of a business as it represents an infrequent transaction that occurs in limited circumstances that impacts the comparability between operating periods. We believe the adjustment of this loss supplements the GAAP information with a measure that may be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance.\nFrom time to time in the future, there may be other items that we may exclude if we believe that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management.\nThe non-GAAP adjustments made reflect the following:\n(1)During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we issued $500 aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due October 2030. We used a portion of the proceeds to redeem all of our outstanding 6.125% senior notes due 2023. As a result of our redemption of the 2023 Notes, we incurred incremental expenses of approximately $10.0 million, comprised of a call premium payment of $6.1 million, overlapping interest expense of approximately $1.4 million and a $2.5 million non-cash charge for the write-off of unamortized financing costs in interest expense. These amounts are included in interest expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n(2)During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we recognized a loss of $2.6 million, included in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations, from the sale of our Breeder's Choice business unit after concluding it was not a strategic business for our Pet segment.\n(3)During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge for two private company investments. The impairment was recorded as part of other (expense) income.\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>September 25, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>September 26, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands, except per share amounts) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Income and Diluted Net Income Per Share Reconciliation </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP net income attributable to Central Garden & Pet Company </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>151,746 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>120,676 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incremental expenses from note redemption and issuance </td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>9,952 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on sale of business </td> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>2,611 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Impairments </td> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,566 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax effect of incremental expenses, loss on sale and impairment </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,711) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(747) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP net income attributable to Central Garden & Pet Company </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>161,598 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>123,495 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP diluted net income per share </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.75 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.20 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP diluted net income per share </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.92 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.26 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shares used in GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share calculation </td> <td> </td> <td>55,248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,738 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOrganic Net Sales Reconciliation\nWe have provided organic net sales, a non-GAAP measure that excludes the impact of recent acquisitions and dispositions, because we believe it permits investors to better understand the performance of our historical business. We define organic net sales as net sales from our historical business derived by excluding the net sales from businesses acquired or exited in the preceding 12 months. After an acquired business has been part of our consolidated results for 12 months, the change in net sales thereafter is considered part of the increase or decrease in organic net sales.

costs, consumer attitudes toward discretionary spending, currency fluctuations, and other macro-economic factors which may impact levels of consumer spending. In certain fiscal periods, we have been adversely impacted by rising input costs related to domestic inflation, particularly relating to grain and seed prices, fuel prices and the ingredients used in our garden controls and fertilizer business as well as heightened import costs such as shipping container costs and tariffs. Rising costs in those periods have made it difficult for us to increase prices to our retail customers at a pace sufficient to enable us to maintain margins.\nDuring fiscal 2021, inflation was broad-based and we saw significant increases across commodity and material costs, freight and labor. During fiscal 2020, we saw more moderate increases to commodity, labor and freight costs. During fiscal 2019, commodity costs increased\nwhile freight costs moderated. In fiscal 2020 and 2019, tariffs implemented during the year had a negative impact in instances where we were unable to pass through the incremental costs.\nWeather and Seasonality\nOur sales of lawn and garden products are influenced by weather and climate conditions in the different markets we serve. Our Garden segment's business is highly seasonal. In fiscal 2021, approximately 69% of our Garden segment's net sales and 60% of our total net sales occurred during our second and third fiscal quarters. Substantially all of the Garden segment's operating income is typically generated in this period, which has historically offset the operating loss incurred during the first fiscal quarter of the year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have financed our growth through a combination of internally generated funds, bank borrowings, supplier credit, and sales of equity and debt securities to the public.\nOur business is seasonal and our working capital requirements and capital resources track closely to this seasonal pattern. Generally, during the first fiscal quarter, accounts receivable reach their lowest level while inventory, accounts payable and short-term borrowings begin to increase. During the second fiscal quarter, receivables, accounts payable and short-term borrowings increase, reflecting the build-up of inventory and related payables in anticipation of the peak lawn and garden selling season. During the third fiscal quarter, inventory levels remain relatively constant while accounts receivable peak and short-term borrowings start to decline as cash collections are received during the peak selling season. During the fourth fiscal quarter, inventory levels are at their lowest, and accounts receivable and payables are substantially reduced through conversion of receivables to cash.\nWe service two broad markets: pet supplies and lawn and garden supplies. Our pet supplies businesses involve products that have a year round selling cycle with a slight degree of seasonality. As a result, it is not necessary to maintain large quantities of inventory to meet peak demands. Our lawn and garden businesses are highly seasonal with approximately 69% of our Garden segment's net sales occurring during the second and third fiscal quarters. This seasonality requires the shipment of large quantities of product well ahead of the peak consumer buying periods. To encourage retailers and distributors to stock large quantities of inventory, industry practice has been for manufacturers to give extended credit terms and/or promotional discounts.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $13.5 million, from $264.3 million in fiscal 2020 to $250.8 million in fiscal 2021. The decrease in cash provided was due primarily to changes in our working capital accounts, primarily an increase in inventory from an intentional build-up due to the overall increased demand for our products, as compared to the prior year.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $59.3 million, from $205.0 million in fiscal 2019 to $264.3 million in fiscal 2020. The increase in cash provided was due primarily to changes in our working capital accounts, predominately an increase in accounts receivable, due to the increase in sales during the latter half of the fourth quarter compared to the prior year, better working capital management and stronger operating performance during the current fiscal year.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $851.3 million from $48.1 million in fiscal 2020 to $899.4 million in fiscal 2021. The increase in cash used in investing activities was due primarily to acquisition activity and an increase in capital expenditures of approximately $37 million in the current year compared to the prior year, partially offset by proceeds received from the sale of our Breeder's Choice business during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and decreased investments in the current year compared to the prior year. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we acquired DoMyOwn for approximately $81 million. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we acquired Hopewell Nursery on December 31, 2020 for approximately $81 million and Green Garden Products on February 11, 2021 for approximately $571 million and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we acquired D&D Commodities for approximately $88 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $28.2 million from $76.3 million in fiscal 2019 to $48.1 million in fiscal 2020. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was due primarily to acquisition activity in the prior year, partially offset by an $11.5 million increase in capital expenditures in the current year compared to the prior year. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we acquired the remaining 55% interest in Arden Companies for approximately $11 million, and during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 we acquired C&S Products for approximately $30 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $481.0 million from $60.6 million of cash used in fiscal 2020 to $420.5 million of cash provided in fiscal 2021. The increase in cash provided by financing activities during the current year was due primarily to the issuance of $500 million of our 2030 Notes in October 2020 and $400 million of our 2031 Notes in April 2021, partially offset by the repayment of our 2023 Notes and the corresponding premium paid on extinguishment as well as debt issuance costs incurred on the issuances of the 2030 Notes and 2031 Notes. We also decreased open market purchases of our common stock during the current year period as compared to the prior year. During fiscal 2021, the Company repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares of its non-voting common stock (CENTA) on the open market at an aggregate cost of approximately $21.8 million, or $41.91 per share, in addition to $8.2 million used for minimum statutory tax withholdings related to the net share settlement of our stock.\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased $50.2 million from $110.8 million of cash provided in fiscal 2019 to $60.6 million cash used in fiscal 2020. The decrease in cash used in financing activities during the current year was due primarily to our repayment of approximately $46 million of acquired long-term debt subsequent to our acquisitions of Arden and C&S Products during fiscal 2019, as well as decreased open market purchases of our common stock during the current year. During fiscal 2020, we repurchased approximately 0.2 million shares of our voting common stock (CENT) at an aggregate cost of approximately $6.6 million, or approximately $26.63 per share, and 1.8 million shares of our non-voting Class A common stock (CENTA) at an aggregate cost of approximately $45.7 million, or approximately $25.90 per share, in addition to $6.9 million used for minimum statutory tax withholdings related to the net share settlement of our stock.\nWe expect that our principal sources of funds will be cash generated from our operations, proceeds from our debt and equity offerings, and, if necessary, borrowings under our $400 million asset backed loan facility. Based on our anticipated cash needs, availability under our asset backed loan facility and the scheduled maturity of our debt, we believe that our sources of liquidity should be adequate to meet our working capital, capital spending and other cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, we cannot assure you that these sources will continue to provide us with sufficient liquidity and, should we require it, that we will be able to obtain financing on terms satisfactory to us, or at all.\nWe believe that cash flows from operating activities, funds available under our asset backed loan facility, and arrangements with suppliers will be adequate to fund our presently anticipated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our capital expenditures, which are related primarily to replacements and expansion of and upgrades to plant and equipment and also investment in our continued implementation of a scalable enterprise-wide information technology platform, will be approximately $80 million - $90 million over the next 12 months.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have acquired a large number of businesses in the past, and we anticipate that we will continue to evaluate potential acquisition candidates in the future. If one or more potential acquisition opportunities, including those that would be material, become available in the near future, we may require additional external capital. In addition, such acquisitions would subject us to the general risks associated with acquiring companies, particularly if the acquisitions are relatively large.\nStock Repurchases\nDuring fiscal 2021, the Company repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares of its non-voting common stock (CENTA) on the open market at an aggregate cost of approximately $21.8 million, or $41.91 per share. In August 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program to purchase up to $100 million of our common stock (the \"2019 Repurchase Authorization\"). The 2019 Repurchase Authorization has no fixed expiration date and expires when the amount authorized has been used or the Board withdraws its authorization. As of September 25, 2021, no repurchases had been made under the $100 million 2019 Repurchase Authorization.\nIn February 2019, the Board of Directors authorized us to make supplemental purchases to minimize dilution resulting from issuances under our equity compensation plans (the \"Equity Dilution Authorization\"). In addition to our regular share repurchase program, we are permitted to purchase annually a number of shares equal to the number of shares of restricted stock or stock options granted in the prior fiscal year, to the extent not already repurchased, and the current fiscal year. The Equity Dilution Authorization has no fixed expiration date and expires when the Board withdraws its authorization. As of September 26, 2021, we had authorization remaining from the fiscal 2021 equity plan activity to repurchase up to 1.2 million shares under our Equity Dilution Authorization.\nTotal Debt\nAt September 25, 2021, our total debt outstanding was $1,185.8 million versus $694.1 million at September 26, 2020.\nSenior Notes\nIssuance of $400 million 4.125% Senior Notes due 2031\nIn April 2021, we issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due April 2031 (the \"2031 Notes\"). We used the net proceeds from the offering to repay all outstanding borrowings under our Amended Credit Facility, with the remainder to be used for general corporate purposes.\nWe incurred approximately $6 million of debt issuance costs in conjunction with this issuance, which included underwriter fees and legal, accounting and rating agency expenses. The debt issuance costs are being amortized over the term of the 2031 Notes.\nThe 2031 Notes require semi-annual interest payments on April 30 and October 30, which commenced October 30, 2021. The 2031 Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by each of our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries which are borrowers under or guarantors of our Amended Credit Facility. The 2031 Notes were issued in a private placement under Rule 144A and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933.\nWe may redeem some or all of the 2031 Notes at any time, at our option, prior to April 30, 2026 at the principal amount plus a \"make whole\" premium. At any time prior to April 30, 2024, we may also redeem, at our option, up to 40% of the notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 104.125% of the principal amount of the notes. We may redeem some or all of the 2031 Notes at our option, at any time on or after April 30, 2026 for 102.063%, on or after April 30, 2027 for 101.375%, on or after April 30, 2028 for 100.688% and on or after April 30, 2029 for 100.0%, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nThe holders of the 2031 Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the 2031 Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of specific kinds of changes of control.\nThe 2031 Notes contain customary high yield covenants, including covenants limiting debt incurrence and restricted payments, subject to certain baskets and exceptions. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of September 25, 2021.\nIssuance of $500 million 4.125% Senior Notes due 2030 and Redemption of $400 million 6.125% Senior Notes due 2023\nIn October 2020, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due October 2030 (the \"2030 Notes\"). In November 2020, we used a portion of the net proceeds to redeem all of our outstanding 6.125% senior notes due November 2023 (the \"2023 Notes\") at a redemption price of 101.531% plus accrued and unpaid interest, and to pay related fees and expenses, with the remainder for general corporate purposes.\nWe incurred approximately $8.0 million of debt issuance costs associated with this transaction, which included underwriter fees and legal, accounting and rating agency expenses. The debt issuance costs are being amortized over the term of the 2030 Notes.\nAs a result of our redemption of the 2023 Notes, we incurred a call premium payment of $6.1 million, overlapping interest expense for 30 days of approximately $1.4 million and a $2.5 million non-cash charge for the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 2023 Notes. These amounts are included in interest expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nThe 2030 Notes require semiannual interest payments on October 15 and April 15, which commenced April 15, 2021. The 2030 Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by each of our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries which are borrowers under or guarantors of our senior secured revolving credit facility or guarantee our other debt.\nWe may redeem some or all of the 2030 Notes at any time, at our option, prior to October 15, 2025 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a make-whole\u201d premium. Prior to October 15, 2023, we may redeem up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 104.125% of the principal amount of the notes. We may redeem some or all of the 2030 Notes, at our option, in whole or in part, at any time on or after October 15, 2025 for 102.063%, on or after October 15, 2026 for 101.375%, on or after October 15, 2027 for 100.688% and on or after October 15, 2028 for 100.0%, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nThe holders of the 2030 Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the 2030 Notes at a purchase price equal to 101.0% of the principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of a change of control.\nThe 2030 Notes contain customary high yield covenants, including covenants limiting debt incurrence and restricted payments, subject to certain baskets and exceptions. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of September 25, 2021.\n$300 Million, 5.125% Senior Notes due 2028\nOn December 14, 2017, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due February 2028 (the \"2028 Notes\"). We will use the net proceeds from the offering to finance future acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.\nWe incurred approximately $4.6 million of debt issuance costs in conjunction with this transaction, which included underwriter fees and legal, accounting and rating agency expenses. The debt issuance costs are being amortized over the term of the 2028 notes.\nThe 2028 Notes require semiannual interest payments on February 1 and August 1, which commenced on August 1, 2018. The 2028 Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries who are borrowers under or guarantors of our senior secured revolving credit facility or who guarantee the 2023 Notes.\nWe may redeem some or all of the 2028 Notes at any time, at our option, prior to January 1, 2023 at the principal amount plus a \"make whole\" premium. We may redeem some or all of the 2028 Notes at our option, at any time on or after January 1, 2023 for 102.563% on or after January 1, 2024 for 101.708%, on or after January 1, 2025 for 100.854% and on or after January 1, 2026 for 100% plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nThe holders of the 2028 Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the 2028 Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of a change of control.\nThe 2028 Notes contain customary high-yield covenants, including covenants limiting debt incurrence and restricted payments, subject to certain baskets and exceptions. We were in compliance with all covenants as of September 25, 2021.\nAsset-Based Loan Facility Amendment\nOn September 27, 2019, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ( Amended Credit Facility\u201d). The Amended Credit Facility amends and restates the previous credit agreement dated April 22, 2016 and continues to provide up to a $400.0 million principal amount senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, with up to an additional $200.0 million principal amount available with the consent of the Lenders, as defined, if we exercise the accordion feature set forth therein. The Amended Credit Facility now matures on September 27, 2024. We may borrow, repay and reborrow amounts under the Amended Credit Facility until its maturity date, at which time all amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility must be repaid in full.\nThe Amended Credit Facility is subject to a borrowing base that is calculated using a formula based upon eligible receivables and inventory minus certain reserves and adjustments. The Amended Credit Facility also allows the Company to add real property to the borrowing base so long as the real property is subject to a first priority lien in favor of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders. Net availability under the Amended Credit Facility was $400 million as of September 25, 2021. The Amended Credit Facility includes a $50 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and an increased $40 million sublimit for short-notice borrowings. We incurred approximately $1.6 million of debt issuance costs in conjunction with this transaction, which included underwriter fees and legal expenses. The debt issuance costs are being amortized over the term of the Amended Credit Facility. As of September 25, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding and no letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility. There were other letters of credit of $1.5 million outstanding as of September 25, 2021.\nBorrowings under the Amended Credit Facility will bear interest at an index based on LIBOR or, at our option, the Base Rate (defined as the highest of (a) the Truist prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%), plus, in either case, an applicable margin based on our consolidated senior leverage ratio and (d) 0.00%. Such applicable margin for LIBOR-based borrowings fluctuates between 1.00% and 1.50% and was 1.00% as of September 25, 2021, and such applicable margin for Base Rate borrowings fluctuates between 0.00% and 0.50% , and was 0.00% as of September 25, 2021. An unused line fee shall be payable monthly in respect of the total amount of the unutilized Lenders' commitments and short-notice borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility. Letter of credit fees at the applicable margin on the average undrawn and unreimbursed amount of letters of credit shall be payable monthly and a facing fee of 0.125% shall be paid on demand for the stated amount of each letter of credit. We are also required to pay certain fees to the administrative agent under the Amended Credit Facility. As of September 25, 2021, the applicable interest rate related to Base Rate borrowings was 3.3%, and the applicable interest rate related to one-month LIBOR-based borrowings was 1.1%.\nBanks currently reporting information used to set LIBOR will stop doing so after 2021. Various parties, including government agencies, are seeking to identify an alternative rate to replace LIBOR. We are monitoring their efforts, and we will likely amend contracts to accommodate any replacement rate where it is not already provided. Our Amended Credit Facility already anticipates the potential loss of LIBOR and defines procedures for establishing a replacement rate.\nThe Amended Credit Facility continues to contain customary covenants, including financial covenants which require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00:1.00 upon triggered quarterly testing (e.g. when availability falls below certain thresholds established in the agreement), reporting requirements and events of default. The Amended Credit Facility is secured by substantially all assets of the borrowing parties. We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Amended Credit Facility during the period ended September 25, 2021.\nSummarized Financial Information for Guarantors and the Issuer of Guaranteed Securities\nIn April 2021, Central (the \"Parent/Issuer\") issued $400 million of 2031 Notes. In October 2020, Central issued $500 million of 2030 Notes. In December 2017, Central issued $300 million of 2028 Notes. The 2031 Notes, 2030 Notes and 2028 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior basis by each of our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries (the \"Guarantors\"), which are borrowers under or guarantors of our senior secured revolving credit facility (\"Credit Facility\"). The 2031 Notes, 2030 Notes and 2028 Notes are unsecured senior obligations and are subordinated to all of our existing and future secured debt, including our Credit Facility, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the Guarantors to make distributions to the Parent/Issuer. Certain subsidiaries and operating divisions of the Company do not guarantee the 2031, 2030 or 2028 Notes and are referred to as the Non-Guarantors.\nThe Guarantors jointly and severally, and fully and unconditionally, guarantee the payment of the principal and premium, if any, and interest on the 2031, 2030 and 2028 Notes when due, whether at stated maturity of the 2031, 2030 and 2028 Notes, by acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, and all other obligations of the Company to the holders of the 2031, 2030 and 2028 Notes and to the trustee under the indenture governing the 2031, 2030 and 2028 Notes (the \"Guarantee\"). The Guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of each Guarantor and are of equal rank with all other existing and future senior indebtedness of the Guarantors.\nThe obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee shall be limited to the maximum amount as well, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor and to any collections from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such Guarantor under the guarantee not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under Federal or state law.\nThe Guarantee of a Guarantor will be released:\n(1) upon any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that Guarantor (including by way of merger or consolidation), in accordance with the governing indentures, to any person other than the Company;\n(2) if such Guarantor merges with and into the Company, with the Company surviving such merger;\n(3) if the Guarantor is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary; or\n(4) if the Company exercises its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option or the discharge of the Company's obligations under the indentures in accordance with the terms of the indentures.\nThe following tables present summarized financial information of the Parent/Issuer subsidiaries and the Guarantor subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions between subsidiaries under Parent/Issuer and subsidiaries under the Guarantor have been eliminated. The information presented below excludes eliminations necessary to arrive at the information on a consolidated basis. In presenting the summarized financial statements, the equity method of accounting has been applied to the Parent/Issuer's interests in the Guarantor Subsidiaries.

The terms of these contracts vary; some having fixed prices or quantities, others having variable pricing and quantities. For certain agreements, management estimates are used to develop the quantities and pricing for anticipated purchases, and future purchases could vary significantly from such estimates.\n(4)Possible performance-based payments associated with prior acquisitions of businesses are not included in the above table, because they are based on future performance of the businesses acquired, which is not yet known. Performance-based payments of approximately $0.4 million were made in fiscal 2021 related to Hydro-Organics Wholesale, Inc. Potential performance-based periods extend through fiscal 2025 for Hydro-Organics Wholesale, Inc. Payments are capped at $1.0 million per year related to Hydro-Organics Wholesale, Inc.\nAs of September 25, 2021, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $0.3 million. These amounts have been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to the discussion under Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Estimates and assumptions are required for, but are not limited to, accounts receivable and inventory realizable values, fixed asset lives, long-lived asset valuation and impairments, intangible asset lives, stock-based compensation, deferred and current income taxes, self-insurance accruals and the impact of contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the result of which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAlthough not all inclusive, we believe that the following represent the more critical accounting policies, which are subject to estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are not subject to amortization but must be evaluated for impairment.\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually (as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter), or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The qualitative assessment evaluates factors including macro-economic conditions, industry-specific and company-specific considerations, legal and regulatory environments and historical performance. If it is determined that it is more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, it is unnecessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative test is performed to identify potential goodwill impairment. Based on certain circumstances, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test, which compares the estimated fair value of our reporting units to their related carrying values, including goodwill. Impairment is indicated if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, and an impairment charge is recognized for the differential. Our goodwill impairment analysis also includes a comparison of the aggregate estimated fair value of our two reporting units to the Company's total market capitalization.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The estimate of fair value of each of our reporting units is based on our projection of revenues, gross margin, operating costs and cash flows considering historical and estimated future results, general economic and market conditions as well as the impact of planned business and operational strategies. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Assumptions critical to our fair value estimates were: (i) discount rates used in determining the fair value of the reporting units; (ii) estimated future cash flows; and (iii) projected revenue and operating profit growth rates used in the reporting unit models. Actual results may differ from those estimates. The valuations employ present value techniques to measure fair value and consider market factors.\nMost of our goodwill is associated with our Pet segment. In connection with our annual goodwill impairment testing performed during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, we made a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it was necessary to calculate the estimated fair values of our reporting units under the quantitative goodwill impairment test. We completed our\nqualitative assessment of potential goodwill impairment and it was determined that it was more likely than not the fair values of our reporting units were greater than their carrying amounts, and accordingly, no further testing of goodwill was required.\nChanges in the judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment, including expected future cash flows and discount rates, could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units in the future and could result in additional impairment of goodwill.\nIntangible assets\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of acquired trade names and trademarks. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized for an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life if its carrying value exceeds its fair value.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are primarily tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital, and assumed royalty rates. Future net sales and short-term growth rates are estimated for trade names based on management's forecasted financial results which consider key business drivers such as specific revenue growth initiatives, market share changes and general economic factors such as consumer spending.\nDuring fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, we performed evaluations of the fair value of our indefinite-lived trade names and trademarks. Our expected revenues were based on our future operating plan and market growth or decline estimates for future years. No impairment was indicated during our fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 analyses of our indefinite-lived trade names and trademarks.\nAcquisitions\nIn connection with businesses we acquire, management must determine the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Considerable judgment and estimates are required to determine such amounts, particularly as they relate to identifiable intangible assets, and the applicable useful lives related thereto.

The Amended Credit Facility now matures on September 27, 2024.

The qualitative assessment evaluates factors including macro-economic conditions, industry-specific and company-specific considerations, legal and regulatory environments and historical performance. If it is determined that it is more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, it is unnecessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative test is performed to identify potential goodwill impairment. Based on certain circumstances, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test, which compares the estimated fair value of our reporting units to their related carrying values, including goodwill. Impairment is indicated if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, and an impairment charge is recognized for the differential. Our goodwill impairment analysis also includes a comparison of the aggregate estimated fair value of our two reporting units to the Company's total market capitalization.\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Summarized Balance Sheet Information </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands) </td> <td>As of </td> <td> </td> <td>As of </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>September 25, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>September 26, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Parent/Issuer </td> <td> </td> <td>Guarantors </td> <td> </td> <td>Parent/Issuer </td> <td> </td> <td>Guarantors </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current assets </td> <td>$ </td> <td>670,030 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>733,132 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>900,416 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>560,919 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intercompany receivable from Non-guarantor subsidiaries </td> <td>229,795 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61,633 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,329 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61,595 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other assets </td> <td>2,896,162 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,399,165 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,042,206 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,631,167 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total assets </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,795,987 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,193,930 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,978,951 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,253,681 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current liabilities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>185,996 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>298,039 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>170,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>247,810 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt </td> <td>1,184,024 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>693,956 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other liabilities </td> <td>1,272,798 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>151,011 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,095,288 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101,912 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liabilities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,642,818 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>449,050 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,959,622 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>349,722 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) upon any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that Guarantor (including by way of merger or consolidation), in accordance with the governing indentures, to any person other than the Company;\nDebt outstanding on September 25, 2021 was $1,185.8 million compared to $694.1 million as of September 26, 2020.

In connection with our annual goodwill impairment testing performed during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, we made a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it was necessary to calculate the estimated fair values of our reporting units under the quantitative goodwill impairment test. We completed our\n(1)During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we issued $500 aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due October 2030. We used a portion of the proceeds to redeem all of our outstanding 6.125% senior notes due 2023. As a result of our redemption of the 2023 Notes, we incurred incremental expenses of approximately $10.0 million, comprised of a call premium payment of $6.1 million, overlapping interest expense of approximately $1.4 million and a $2.5 million non-cash charge for the write-off of unamortized financing costs in interest expense. These amounts are included in interest expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The estimate of fair value of each of our reporting units is based on our projection of revenues, gross margin, operating costs and cash flows considering historical and estimated future results, general economic and market conditions as well as the impact of planned business and operational strategies. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Assumptions critical to our fair value estimates were: (i) discount rates used in determining the fair value of the reporting units; (ii) estimated future cash flows; and (iii) projected revenue and operating profit growth rates used in the reporting unit models. Actual results may differ from those estimates. The valuations employ present value techniques to measure fair value and consider market factors.\nNet Interest Expense\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $851.3 million from $48.1 million in fiscal 2020 to $899.4 million in fiscal 2021. The increase in cash used in investing activities was due primarily to acquisition activity and an increase in capital expenditures of approximately $37 million in the current year compared to the prior year, partially offset by proceeds received from the sale of our Breeder's Choice business during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and decreased investments in the current year compared to the prior year. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we acquired DoMyOwn for approximately $81 million. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we acquired Hopewell Nursery on December 31, 2020 for approximately $81 million and Green Garden Products on February 11, 2021 for approximately $571 million and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we acquired D&D Commodities for approximately $88 million.\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PET </td> <td> </td> <td>GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended September 25, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Net sales (GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td>Effect of acquisitions & divestitures on increase in net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>Net sales organic </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reported net sales FY 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,894.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,894.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reported net sales FY 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,678.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,659.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$ increase </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>216.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(18.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>235.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% increase </td> <td> </td> <td>12.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn fiscal 2021, our consolidated net sales were $3.3 billion, of which our Pet segment, or Pet, accounted for approximately $1.9 billion and our Garden segment, or Garden, accounted for approximately $1.4 billion.

Such applicable margin for LIBOR-based borrowings fluctuates between 1.00% and 1.50% and was 1.00% as of September 25, 2021, and such applicable margin for Base Rate borrowings fluctuates between 0.00% and 0.50% , and was 0.00% as of September 25, 2021. An unused line fee shall be payable monthly in respect of the total amount of the unutilized Lenders' commitments and short-notice borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility. Letter of credit fees at the applicable margin on the average undrawn and unreimbursed amount of letters of credit shall be payable monthly and a facing fee of 0.125% shall be paid on demand for the stated amount of each letter of credit. We are also required to pay certain fees to the administrative agent under the Amended Credit Facility. As of September 25, 2021, the applicable interest rate related to Base Rate borrowings was 3.3%, and the applicable interest rate related to one-month LIBOR-based borrowings was 1.1%.\nThe holders of the 2031 Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the 2031 Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of specific kinds of changes of control.\nFinancing Activities\nNet sales for fiscal 2021 increased $608.2 million, or 22.6%, to $3,303.7 million from $2,695.5 million in fiscal 2020. Organic net sales, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures in the last 12 months, increased $335.3 million, or 12.5% in fiscal 2021. Branded product sales increased $459.8 million, and sales of other manufacturers' products increased $148.4 million. Branded product sales include products we produce under Central brand names and products we produce under third-party brands. Sales of branded products represented 77% of our total sales in fiscal 2021 compared with 78% in fiscal 2020. Private label sales represent approximately 10% to 15% of our consolidated net sales.\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded based on their fair values at the date of acquisition.

Forecasting and planning remain challenging in the current environment and will continue to be challenging as the pandemic eases in the future. In the current uncertain environment, our employees, customers and consumers will continue to be our priority as we manage our business to deliver long-term growth.\nD&D Commodities\nWeather and Seasonality\nWe expect that our principal sources of funds will be cash generated from our operations, proceeds from our debt and equity offerings, and, if necessary, borrowings under our $400 million asset backed loan facility. Based on our anticipated cash needs, availability under our asset backed loan facility and the scheduled maturity of our debt, we believe that our sources of liquidity should be adequate to meet our working capital, capital spending and other cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, we cannot assure you that these sources will continue to provide us with sufficient liquidity and, should we require it, that we will be able to obtain financing on terms satisfactory to us, or at all.\nOur business is seasonal and our working capital requirements and capital resources track closely to this seasonal pattern. Generally, during the first fiscal quarter, accounts receivable reach their lowest level while inventory, accounts payable and short-term borrowings begin to increase. During the second fiscal quarter, receivables, accounts payable and short-term borrowings increase, reflecting the build-up of inventory and related payables in anticipation of the peak lawn and garden selling season. During the third fiscal quarter, inventory levels remain relatively constant while accounts receivable peak and short-term borrowings start to decline as cash collections are received during the peak selling season. During the fourth fiscal quarter, inventory levels are at their lowest, and accounts receivable and payables are substantially reduced through conversion of receivables to cash.\n(3)During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge for two private company investments. The impairment was recorded as part of other (expense) income.\nIssuance of $400 million 4.125% Senior Notes due 2031\nThe Amended Credit Facility is subject to a borrowing base that is calculated using a formula based upon eligible receivables and inventory minus certain reserves and adjustments. The Amended Credit Facility also allows the Company to add real property to the borrowing base so long as the real property is subject to a first priority lien in favor of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders. Net availability under the Amended Credit Facility was $400 million as of September 25, 2021. The Amended Credit Facility includes a $50 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and an increased $40 million sublimit for short-notice borrowings. We incurred approximately $1.6 million of debt issuance costs in conjunction with this transaction, which included underwriter fees and legal expenses. The debt issuance costs are being amortized over the term of the Amended Credit Facility. As of September 25, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding and no letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility. There were other letters of credit of $1.5 million outstanding as of September 25, 2021.\nCOVID-19 Impact\nFiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWarehouse and administrative expense increased $56.3 million, or 19.0%, to $352.7 million in fiscal 2021 and decreased as a percentage of net sales to 10.7% in fiscal 2021 from 11.0% in fiscal 2020. The increased expense was driven by the addition of the four recent acquisitions in the Garden segment and a $2.6 million loss in our Pet segment resulting from the sale of the Breeder's Choice business in our fiscal 2021 first quarter. Additionally, both operating segments experienced increased labor and payroll-related expense from wage inflation. Corporate expenses increased $3.6 million due primarily to increased variable compensation, payroll expense and increased non-cash equity compensation expense.\nThe obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee shall be limited to the maximum amount as well, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor and to any collections from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such Guarantor under the guarantee not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under Federal or state law.\nOur net income for fiscal 2021 was $151.7 million, or $2.75 per diluted share, compared to $120.7 million, or $2.20 per diluted share, for fiscal 2020. The fiscal 2021 25.0% improvement in earnings per diluted share was due to strong revenue growth and operating margin improvement.\n\u2022Loss on sale of business: we have excluded the impact of the loss on the sale of a business as it represents an infrequent transaction that occurs in limited circumstances that impacts the comparability between operating periods. We believe the adjustment of this loss supplements the GAAP information with a measure that may be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance.\nThe 2028 Notes contain customary high-yield covenants, including covenants limiting debt incurrence and restricted payments, subject to certain baskets and exceptions. We were in compliance with all covenants as of September 25, 2021.\n\u2022Net sales for fiscal 2021 increased $608.2 million, or 22.6%, to $3,303.7 million, with organic net sales increasing $335.3 million and sales from our four recent acquisitions of $272.9 million. Our Pet segment sales increased 12.9%, and our Garden segment sales increased 38.5%.\nDuring fiscal 2021, inflation was broad-based and we saw significant increases across commodity and material costs, freight and labor. During fiscal 2020, we saw more moderate increases to commodity, labor and freight costs. During fiscal 2019, commodity costs increased\nIn April 2021, we issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due April 2031 (the \"2031 Notes\"). We used the net proceeds from the offering to repay all outstanding borrowings under our Amended Credit Facility, with the remainder to be used for general corporate purposes.\nWe incurred approximately $8.0 million of debt issuance costs associated with this transaction, which included underwriter fees and legal, accounting and rating agency expenses. The debt issuance costs are being amortized over the term of the 2030 Notes.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAlthough not all inclusive, we believe that the following represent the more critical accounting policies, which are subject to estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nDuring fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, we performed evaluations of the fair value of our indefinite-lived trade names and trademarks. Our expected revenues were based on our future operating plan and market growth or decline estimates for future years. No impairment was indicated during our fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 analyses of our indefinite-lived trade names and trademarks.\nIn October 2020, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due October 2030 (the \"2030 Notes\"). In November 2020, we used a portion of the net proceeds to redeem all of our outstanding 6.125% senior notes due November 2023 (the \"2023 Notes\") at a redemption price of 101.531% plus accrued and unpaid interest, and to pay related fees and expenses, with the remainder for general corporate purposes.\nTotal Debt\nFiscal Year 2021 Acquisitions\nIntangible assets\nWe have financed our growth through a combination of internally generated funds, bank borrowings, supplier credit, and sales of equity and debt securities to the public.\nOur effective income tax rate was 21.6% for fiscal 2021 compared to 21.0% for fiscal 2020. The increased effective income tax rate in fiscal 2021 was due primarily to a decrease in benefit from income tax credits and an increase in taxable foreign earnings.\nWe incurred approximately $4.6 million of debt issuance costs in conjunction with this transaction, which included underwriter fees and legal, accounting and rating agency expenses. The debt issuance costs are being amortized over the term of the 2028 notes.\nHopewell Nursery\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have acquired a large number of businesses in the past, and we anticipate that we will continue to evaluate potential acquisition candidates in the future. If one or more potential acquisition opportunities, including those that would be material, become available in the near future, we may require additional external capital. In addition, such acquisitions would subject us to the general risks associated with acquiring companies, particularly if the acquisitions are relatively large.\nWe service two broad markets: pet supplies and lawn and garden supplies. Our pet supplies businesses involve products that have a year round selling cycle with a slight degree of seasonality. As a result, it is not necessary to maintain large quantities of inventory to meet peak demands. Our lawn and garden businesses are highly seasonal with approximately 69% of our Garden segment's net sales occurring during the second and third fiscal quarters. This seasonality requires the shipment of large quantities of product well ahead of the peak consumer buying periods. To encourage retailers and distributors to stock large quantities of inventory, industry practice has been for manufacturers to give extended credit terms and/or promotional discounts.\nIn April 2021, Central (the \"Parent/Issuer\") issued $400 million of 2031 Notes. In October 2020, Central issued $500 million of 2030 Notes. In December 2017, Central issued $300 million of 2028 Notes. The 2031 Notes, 2030 Notes and 2028 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior basis by each of our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries (the \"Guarantors\"), which are borrowers under or guarantors of our senior secured revolving credit facility (\"Credit Facility\"). The 2031 Notes, 2030 Notes and 2028 Notes are unsecured senior obligations and are subordinated to all of our existing and future secured debt, including our Credit Facility, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the Guarantors to make distributions to the Parent/Issuer. Certain subsidiaries and operating divisions of the Company do not guarantee the 2031, 2030 or 2028 Notes and are referred to as the Non-Guarantors.\nThe holders of the 2030 Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the 2030 Notes at a purchase price equal to 101.0% of the principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of a change of control.\nChanges in the judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment, including expected future cash flows and discount rates, could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units in the future and could result in additional impairment of goodwill.\nNet Income and Earnings Per Share\nGarden net sales increased $391.3 million, or 38.5%, to $1,408.8 million in fiscal 2021 from $1,017.5 million in fiscal 2020. Organic sales increased $99.5 million, or 9.8%, and sales from our recent acquisitions of DoMyOwn, Hopewell Nursery, Green Garden Products and D&D Commodities contributed $291.8 million. The increased organic sales were broad-based across our entire Garden portfolio, including sales increases in sales of other manufacturers' products, wild bird feed, live plants and controls and fertilizers. We believe the sales increase across our Garden portfolio was driven in significant part by increased consumer home gardening related to the pandemic and retailer listing gains. The organic sales increase was primarily volume driven but was also aided by price increases necessitated by the current inflationary cost environment, especially in our wild bird feed business. Garden branded sales increased $283.5 million and sales of other manufacturers' products increased $107.8 million.\nWe believe that cash flows from operating activities, funds available under our asset backed loan facility, and arrangements with suppliers will be adequate to fund our presently anticipated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our capital expenditures, which are related primarily to replacements and expansion of and upgrades to plant and equipment and also investment in our continued implementation of a scalable enterprise-wide information technology platform, will be approximately $80 million - $90 million over the next 12 months.\nWe incurred approximately $6 million of debt issuance costs in conjunction with this issuance, which included underwriter fees and legal, accounting and rating agency expenses. The debt issuance costs are being amortized over the term of the 2031 Notes.\nIn the Pet segment, gross profit increased due to increased sales, favorable product mix and productivity gains, partially offset by significant inflationary headwinds.\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $481.0 million from $60.6 million of cash used in fiscal 2020 to $420.5 million of cash provided in fiscal 2021. The increase in cash provided by financing activities during the current year was due primarily to the issuance of $500 million of our 2030 Notes in October 2020 and $400 million of our 2031 Notes in April 2021, partially offset by the repayment of our 2023 Notes and the corresponding premium paid on extinguishment as well as debt issuance costs incurred on the issuances of the 2030 Notes and 2031 Notes. We also decreased open market purchases of our common stock during the current year period as compared to the prior year. During fiscal 2021, the Company repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares of its non-voting common stock (CENTA) on the open market at an aggregate cost of approximately $21.8 million, or $41.91 per share, in addition to $8.2 million used for minimum statutory tax withholdings related to the net share settlement of our stock.\nCentral Garden & Pet Company is a leading innovator, producer and distributor of branded and private label products for the lawn & garden and pet supplies markets in the United States.\n(3)Contracts for purchases of grains, grass seed and pet food ingredients, used primarily to mitigate risk associated with increases in market prices and commodity availability, may obligate us to make future purchases based on estimated yields. The terms of these contracts vary; some having fixed prices or quantities, others having variable pricing and quantities. For certain agreements, management estimates are used to develop the quantities and pricing for anticipated purchases, and future purchases could vary significantly from such estimates.\nSelling and delivery expense increased $61.5 million, or 20.4%, to $363.7 million in fiscal 2021 but decreased as a percentage of net sales from 11.2% in fiscal 2020 to 11.0% in fiscal 2021. The increase in selling and delivery expense was due primarily to the addition of our four fiscal 2021 acquisitions, increased delivery expense resulting from increased sales volumes and higher shipping costs, and increased headcount and marketing investments for market research, brand development and innovation. The decline in selling and delivery expense as a percentage of net sales was due primarily to improved overhead absorption.\nThe following is management's discussion of the financial results, liquidity and other key items related to our performance. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those indicated in forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A - Risk Factors.\u201d\n\nThe pandemic and related increase in demand have created operational challenges, which have impacted our service and fill rates. In our supply chain, we may continue to experience increased operational and logistics costs. We may also experience additional disruptions in our supply chain as the pandemic continues, although we cannot reasonably estimate the potential impact or timing of those events, and we may not be able to mitigate such impact. We continue to face supply constraints of commodities, material and freight and the limited availability of labor and inflationary pressures stemming from the COVID-19 operating environment, including notable increases in costs for key commodities, material, labor and freight.\nThe Guarantee of a Guarantor will be released:\nThe 2028 Notes require semiannual interest payments on February 1 and August 1, which commenced on August 1, 2018. The 2028 Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries who are borrowers under or guarantors of our senior secured revolving credit facility or who guarantee the 2023 Notes.\nWe may redeem some or all of the 2030 Notes at any time, at our option, prior to October 15, 2025 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a make-whole\u201d premium. Prior to October 15, 2023, we may redeem up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 104.125% of the principal amount of the notes. We may redeem some or all of the 2030 Notes, at our option, in whole or in part, at any time on or after October 15, 2025 for 102.063%, on or after October 15, 2026 for 101.375%, on or after October 15, 2027 for 100.688% and on or after October 15, 2028 for 100.0%, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\n(1) The product category was less than 10% of our consolidated net sales in the period.\nContractual Obligations\nGarden operating income increased $23.3 million, or 20.2%, to $138.8 million for fiscal 2021. The increase was due to increased sales and higher gross profit partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses. Garden operating margin declined 150 basis points to 9.8% due primarily to higher selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales and the initial inventory-related impact of purchase accounting from our four recent acquisitions.\n\n(4)Possible performance-based payments associated with prior acquisitions of businesses are not included in the above table, because they are based on future performance of the businesses acquired, which is not yet known. Performance-based payments of approximately $0.4 million were made in fiscal 2021 related to Hydro-Organics Wholesale, Inc. Potential performance-based periods extend through fiscal 2025 for Hydro-Organics Wholesale, Inc. Payments are capped at $1.0 million per year related to Hydro-Organics Wholesale, Inc.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the relative percentages that certain income and expense items bear to net sales: \nIn the Garden segment, gross profit increased due to increased sales, including the inorganic contribution of the four recent acquisitions and gross productivity efforts, partially offset by heightened costs across commodities, freight and labor.\n\nRefer to the discussion under Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements.\nFiscal 2021 Financial Highlights\nCritical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments\nThe non-GAAP adjustments made reflect the following:\n\nOperating Activities\nSummarized Financial Information for Guarantors and the Issuer of Guaranteed Securities\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has led to adverse impacts on human health, the global economy and society at large. From the beginning, our priority has been the safety of our employees, customers and consumers.\nGreen Garden Products\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n(2)Estimated interest payments to be made on our 2028 Notes, our 2030 Notes and our 2031 Notes. See Note 11 - Long-Term Debt to the consolidated financial statements for description of interest rate terms.\n(2)During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we recognized a loss of $2.6 million, included in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations, from the sale of our Breeder's Choice business unit after concluding it was not a strategic business for our Pet segment.\nIn February 2019, the Board of Directors authorized us to make supplemental purchases to minimize dilution resulting from issuances under our equity compensation plans (the \"Equity Dilution Authorization\"). In addition to our regular share repurchase program, we are permitted to purchase annually a number of shares equal to the number of shares of restricted stock or stock options granted in the prior fiscal year, to the extent not already repurchased, and the current fiscal year. The Equity Dilution Authorization has no fixed expiration date and expires when the Board withdraws its authorization. As of September 26, 2021, we had authorization remaining from the fiscal 2021 equity plan activity to repurchase up to 1.2 million shares under our Equity Dilution Authorization.\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe 2031 Notes require semi-annual interest payments on April 30 and October 30, which commenced October 30, 2021. The 2031 Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by each of our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries which are borrowers under or guarantors of our Amended Credit Facility. The 2031 Notes were issued in a private placement under Rule 144A and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933.\nWe report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). However, to supplement the financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EBITDA, organic sales; and non-GAAP net income and diluted net income per share. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of specific items (described below) may be useful to investors in their assessment of our ongoing operating performance and provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods.\nGross profit for fiscal 2021 increased $174.3 million, or 21.9%, to $970.9 million from $796.6 million in fiscal 2020. Both Garden and Pet contributed to the increase in gross profit. The decline in gross margin was due to significant cost inflation and the impact of inventory-related purchase accounting which was largely offset by price increases and productivity gains. Both segments are being impacted by the rapidly increasing cost environment where we are seeing widespread inflation across commodities (e.g., sunflower, milo, millet and foam), freight and labor. We intend to seek price increases to offset continued inflationary pressures but do not anticipate we will be able to fully offset the cost pressures in fiscal 2022.\nAt September 25, 2021, our total debt outstanding was $1,185.8 million versus $694.1 million at September 26, 2020.\nGross Profit\nOperating Income\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are primarily tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital, and assumed royalty rates. Future net sales and short-term growth rates are estimated for trade names based on management's forecasted financial results which consider key business drivers such as specific revenue growth initiatives, market share changes and general economic factors such as consumer spending.\nThe 2030 Notes contain customary high yield covenants, including covenants limiting debt incurrence and restricted payments, subject to certain baskets and exceptions. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of September 25, 2021.\n\u2022Incremental expenses from note redemption and issuance: we have excluded the impact of the incremental expenses incurred from the note redemption and issuance as they represent an infrequent transaction that occurs in limited circumstances that impacts the comparability between operating periods. We believe the adjustment of these expenses supplements the GAAP information with a measure that may be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance.\nFiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019\nDuring fiscal 2021, the Company repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares of its non-voting common stock (CENTA) on the open market at an aggregate cost of approximately $21.8 million, or $41.91 per share. In August 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program to purchase up to $100 million of our common stock (the \"2019 Repurchase Authorization\"). The 2019 Repurchase Authorization has no fixed expiration date and expires when the amount authorized has been used or the Board withdraws its authorization. As of September 25, 2021, no repurchases had been made under the $100 million 2019 Repurchase Authorization.\nSenior Notes\nOther income (expense) is comprised of income or loss from investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting, including any associated impairments of investments and foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Other expense was $1.5 million for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021 compared to $4.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 26, 2020, due primarily to a $3.6 million impairment in fiscal 2020 of two investments in private companies impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOrganic Net Sales Reconciliation\nBusiness Overview\n$300 Million, 5.125% Senior Notes due 2028\nDoMyOwn\nCentral has been impacted by COVID-19 in a number of ways, including increased demand evidenced by our organic net sales increase of 13% in fiscal year 2021. The increased demand for our products continues to challenge our supply chain and our ability to procure and manufacture enough product to meet the continued high levels of demand. At some of our facilities, we have experienced reduced productivity and increased employee absences, which we expect to continue during the balance of the pandemic. Our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are currently open and fully operational. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs including personal protective equipment and sanitation costs. We have hosted mobile vaccination clinics at some of our larger manufacturing and distribution sites, in order to make vaccines available to our employees.\nStock Repurchases\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $117.8 million, or 19.7%, from $598.6 million in fiscal 2020 to $716.4 million in fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 22.2% in fiscal 2020 to 21.7% in fiscal 2021; both the Pet segment and corporate contributed to the improvement. Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales increased in the Garden segment due to the four fiscal 2021 acquisitions which include the amortization of the intangible assets resulting from purchase accounting. Corporate expenses are included within administrative expense and relate to the costs of unallocated executive, administrative, finance, legal, human resource, and information technology functions.\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Estimates and assumptions are required for, but are not limited to, accounts receivable and inventory realizable values, fixed asset lives, long-lived asset valuation and impairments, intangible asset lives, stock-based compensation, deferred and current income taxes, self-insurance accruals and the impact of contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the result of which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n(2) if such Guarantor merges with and into the Company, with the Company surviving such merger;\nOur sales of lawn and garden products are influenced by weather and climate conditions in the different markets we serve. Our Garden segment's business is highly seasonal. In fiscal 2021, approximately 69% of our Garden segment's net sales and 60% of our total net sales occurred during our second and third fiscal quarters. Substantially all of the Garden segment's operating income is typically generated in this period, which has historically offset the operating loss incurred during the first fiscal quarter of the year.\nNon-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items:\nOn June 30, 2021, the Company purchased D&D Commodities, Ltd. (\"D&D\"), a provider of high-quality, premium bird feed, for approximately $88 million in cash and the assumption of approximately $30 million of long-term debt. The addition of D&D expands Central's portfolio in the bird feed category and is expected to deepen the Company's relationship with major retailers.\nChange in Segment Components\nIn connection with businesses we acquire, management must determine the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Considerable judgment and estimates are required to determine such amounts, particularly as they relate to identifiable intangible assets, and the applicable useful lives related thereto. Under different assumptions, the resulting valuations could be materially different, which could materially impact the operating results we report.\nInvesting Activities\nThe table below presents our significant contractual cash obligations by fiscal year: \nBanks currently reporting information used to set LIBOR will stop doing so after 2021. Various parties, including government agencies, are seeking to identify an alternative rate to replace LIBOR. We are monitoring their efforts, and we will likely amend contracts to accommodate any replacement rate where it is not already provided. Our Amended Credit Facility already anticipates the potential loss of LIBOR and defines procedures for establishing a replacement rate.\nCorporate expenses increased $3.6 million due primarily to increased variable compensation, payroll expense and increased non-cash equity compensation expense.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $28.2 million from $76.3 million in fiscal 2019 to $48.1 million in fiscal 2020. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was due primarily to acquisition activity in the prior year, partially offset by an $11.5 million increase in capital expenditures in the current year compared to the prior year. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we acquired the remaining 55% interest in Arden Companies for approximately $11 million, and during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 we acquired C&S Products for approximately $30 million.\nAs of September 25, 2021, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $0.3 million. These amounts have been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we began reporting the results of our outdoor cushion operations in the Pet segment as a result of a change in internal management reporting lines due to potential synergies in sourcing, manufacturing and innovation and to be consistent with the reporting of financial information used to assess performance and allocate resources. These operations were previously reported in the Garden segment and are now managed and reported in the Pet segment. All prior period segment disclosures have been recast to reflect this segment change.\nWe have also provided organic net sales, a non-GAAP measure that excludes the impact of businesses purchased or exited in the prior 12 months, because we believe it permits investors to better understand the performance of our historical business without the impact of recent acquisitions or dispositions.\n\n(3) if the Guarantor is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary; or\n\u2022Our operating income increased $56.5 million, or 28.5%, to $254.5 million in fiscal 2021, and as a percentage of net sales improved to 7.7% from 7.3% in fiscal 2020.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nGoodwill\nThe reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are shown in the tables below. We believe that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and other users of our financial statements, by allowing for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operating performance. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating our performance, and we believe these measures similarly may be useful to investors in evaluating our financial and operating performance and the trends in our business from management's point of view. While our management believes that non-GAAP measurements are useful supplemental information, such adjusted results are not intended to replace our GAAP financial results and should be read in conjunction with those GAAP results.\nOperating income increased $56.5 million, or 28.5%, to $254.5 million in fiscal 2021 from $198.0 million in fiscal 2020. Our operating margin was 7.7% in fiscal 2021, increasing from 7.3% in fiscal 2020. Increased sales of $608.2 million and a 50 basis point decrease in selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales were partially offset by a 20 basis point decline in gross margin. Both operating income and margin were favorably impacted by significant pandemic-related increases in demand for our products.\nqualitative assessment of potential goodwill impairment and it was determined that it was more likely than not the fair values of our reporting units were greater than their carrying amounts, and accordingly, no further testing of goodwill was required.\nThe holders of the 2028 Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the 2028 Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of a change of control.\n(1)Excludes $1.5 million of outstanding letters of credit related to normal business transactions. Debt repayments do not reflect the unamortized portion of deferred financing costs associated with the 2028 Notes, 2030 Notes and 2031 Notes of approximately $16.0 million as of September 25, 2021, of which, $2.9 million is amortizable until February 2028, $7.3 million is amortizable until October 2030 and $5.8 million is amortizable until April 2031, and is included in the carrying value of the long-term debt. See Note 11 - Long-Term Debt to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of long-term debt.\n(4) if the Company exercises its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option or the discharge of the Company's obligations under the indentures in accordance with the terms of the indentures.\nWe believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs with our cash and revolving credit facility as we manage through the current economic and health environment.\nOur contractual commitments are presented under the caption Liquidity and Capital Resources.\nResults of Operations (GAAP)\nWe may redeem some or all of the 2028 Notes at any time, at our option, prior to January 1, 2023 at the principal amount plus a \"make whole\" premium. We may redeem some or all of the 2028 Notes at our option, at any time on or after January 1, 2023 for 102.563% on or after January 1, 2024 for 101.708%, on or after January 1, 2025 for 100.854% and on or after January 1, 2026 for 100% plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nIssuance of $500 million 4.125% Senior Notes due 2030 and Redemption of $400 million 6.125% Senior Notes due 2023\nThe Amended Credit Facility continues to contain customary covenants, including financial covenants which require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00:1.00 upon triggered quarterly testing (e.g. when availability falls below certain thresholds established in the agreement), reporting requirements and events of default. The Amended Credit Facility is secured by substantially all assets of the borrowing parties. We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Amended Credit Facility during the period ended September 25, 2021.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nWe have provided organic net sales, a non-GAAP measure that excludes the impact of recent acquisitions and dispositions, because we believe it permits investors to better understand the performance of our historical business. We define organic net sales as net sales from our historical business derived by excluding the net sales from businesses acquired or exited in the preceding 12 months. After an acquired business has been part of our consolidated results for 12 months, the change in net sales thereafter is considered part of the increase or decrease in organic net sales. \nFrom time to time in the future, there may be other items that we may exclude if we believe that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management.\nRecent Developments\nThe following tables present summarized financial information of the Parent/Issuer subsidiaries and the Guarantor subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions between subsidiaries under Parent/Issuer and subsidiaries under the Guarantor have been eliminated. The information presented below excludes eliminations necessary to arrive at the information on a consolidated basis. In presenting the summarized financial statements, the equity method of accounting has been applied to the Parent/Issuer's interests in the Guarantor Subsidiaries. The summarized information excludes financial information of the Non-Guarantors, including earnings from and investments in these entities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $13.5 million, from $264.3 million in fiscal 2020 to $250.8 million in fiscal 2021. The decrease in cash provided was due primarily to changes in our working capital accounts, primarily an increase in inventory from an intentional build-up due to the overall increased demand for our products, as compared to the prior year.\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased $50.2 million from $110.8 million of cash provided in fiscal 2019 to $60.6 million cash used in fiscal 2020. The decrease in cash used in financing activities during the current year was due primarily to our repayment of approximately $46 million of acquired long-term debt subsequent to our acquisitions of Arden and C&S Products during fiscal 2019, as well as decreased open market purchases of our common stock during the current year. During fiscal 2020, we repurchased approximately 0.2 million shares of our voting common stock (CENT) at an aggregate cost of approximately $6.6 million, or approximately $26.63 per share, and 1.8 million shares of our non-voting Class A common stock (CENTA) at an aggregate cost of approximately $45.7 million, or approximately $25.90 per share, in addition to $6.9 million used for minimum statutory tax withholdings related to the net share settlement of our stock.\nNet interest expense increased $18.2 million, or 45.5%, from $40.0 million in fiscal 2020 to $58.2 million in fiscal 2021. In October 2020, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due October 2030 and used the proceeds to redeem all of our outstanding aggregate principal amount 6.125% senior notes due 2023 with the remainder available for general corporate purposes. As a result of our redemption of the 2023 Notes, we recognized incremental interest expense of approximately $10.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Also contributing to the increase in net interest expense was a higher debt balance during fiscal 2021. In April 2021, we issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due April 2031. We used a portion of the net proceeds to repay outstanding amounts under our senior secured revolving credit facility, with the remainder available for general corporate purposes.\nOn December 14, 2017, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due February 2028 (the \"2028 Notes\"). We will use the net proceeds from the offering to finance future acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined by us as income before income tax, net other expense, net interest expense and depreciation and amortization (or operating income plus depreciation and amortization expense). We present adjusted EBITDA because we believe that adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplemental measure in evaluating the cash flows and performance of our business and provides greater transparency into our results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA is used by our management to perform such evaluation. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for cash flow from operations, income from operations or other income statement measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies, many of which present adjusted EBITDA when reporting their results. Other companies may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently and it may not be comparable.\nInflation", "item_7_text": "\u2022Net income for fiscal 2021 was $151.7 million, or $2.75 per share on a diluted basis, compared to net income in fiscal 2020 of $120.7 million, or $2.20 per share on a diluted basis.\nOn February 11, 2021, the Company acquired Flora Parent, Inc. and its subsidiaries (\"Green Garden Products\"), a leading provider of vegetable, herb and flower seed packets, seed starters and plant nutrients in North America, for approximately $571 million. The addition of Green Garden Products expands the Company's portfolio into an adjacent garden category.\nOn December 18, 2020, the Company acquired DoMyOwn, a leading online retailer of professional-grade control products, for approximately $81 million. The acquisition strengthens the Company's position in the control products category and adds a leading online platform for eCommerce fulfillment and digital capabilities.\nOn December 31, 2020, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets of Hopewell Nursery, a leading live goods wholesale grower serving retail nurseries, landscape contractors, wholesalers and garden centers across the Northeast, for approximately $81 million. The addition of Hopewell Nursery to the Central portfolio strengthens the Company's position as a leading live goods provider in the garden category.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $59.3 million, from $205.0 million in fiscal 2019 to $264.3 million in fiscal 2020. The increase in cash provided was due primarily to changes in our working capital accounts, predominately an increase in accounts receivable, due to the increase in sales during the latter half of the fourth quarter compared to the prior year, better working capital management and stronger operating performance during the current fiscal year.\nPet operating income increased $36.8 million, or 21.5%, to $208.2 million in fiscal 2021 from $171.4 million for fiscal 2020. Pet operating income increased due to higher sales and gross profit partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expense. Pet operating margin improved 80 basis points due to increased sales, an improved gross margin and lower selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOn September 27, 2019, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ( Amended Credit Facility\u201d). The Amended Credit Facility amends and restates the previous credit agreement dated April 22, 2016 and continues to provide up to a $400.0 million principal amount senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, with up to an additional $200.0 million principal amount available with the consent of the Lenders, as defined, if we exercise the accordion feature set forth therein. The Amended Credit Facility now matures on September 27, 2024. We may borrow, repay and reborrow amounts under the Amended Credit Facility until its maturity date, at which time all amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility must be repaid in full.\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually (as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter), or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The qualitative assessment evaluates factors including macro-economic conditions, industry-specific and company-specific considerations, legal and regulatory environments and historical performance. If it is determined that it is more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, it is unnecessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative test is performed to identify potential goodwill impairment. Based on certain circumstances, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test, which compares the estimated fair value of our reporting units to their related carrying values, including goodwill. Impairment is indicated if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, and an impairment charge is recognized for the differential. Our goodwill impairment analysis also includes a comparison of the aggregate estimated fair value of our two reporting units to the Company's total market capitalization.\n(1) upon any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that Guarantor (including by way of merger or consolidation), in accordance with the governing indentures, to any person other than the Company;\nDebt outstanding on September 25, 2021 was $1,185.8 million compared to $694.1 million as of September 26, 2020. Our average borrowing rate for fiscal 2021 was 4.4% and for fiscal 2020 was 5.6%.\nPet net sales increased $216.9 million, or 12.9%, to $1,894.9 million in fiscal 2021 from $1,678.0 million in fiscal 2020. Net sales in the prior year include sales from the Breeder's Choice business unit which we sold in December 2020. Organic net sales increased $235.8 million, or 14.2%, as compared to the prior year. The sales increase was broad-based across our entire Pet portfolio and we continue to see increased demand due, among other things, to increased pet ownership of dogs, cats, small animals and reptiles during the pandemic. Organic sales gains were most significant in our dog and cat, sales of other manufacturers' products, and outdoor cushion businesses. The organic sales increase was primarily volume driven but price increases did have a more limited positive impact. Pet branded sales increased $176.3 million and sales of other manufacturers' products increased $40.6 million.\n\nThe following table indicates each class of similar products which represented approximately 10% or more of our consolidated net sales in the fiscal years presented: \nAcquisitions\nOur revenues and margins are dependent on various economic factors, including rates of inflation, energy costs, consumer attitudes toward discretionary spending, currency fluctuations, and other macro-economic factors which may impact levels of consumer spending. In certain fiscal periods, we have been adversely impacted by rising input costs related to domestic inflation, particularly relating to grain and seed prices, fuel prices and the ingredients used in our garden controls and fertilizer business as well as heightened import costs such as shipping container costs and tariffs. Rising costs in those periods have made it difficult for us to increase prices to our retail customers at a pace sufficient to enable us to maintain margins.\nThe 2030 Notes require semiannual interest payments on October 15 and April 15, which commenced April 15, 2021. The 2030 Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by each of our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries which are borrowers under or guarantors of our senior secured revolving credit facility or guarantee our other debt.\nThe 2031 Notes contain customary high yield covenants, including covenants limiting debt incurrence and restricted payments, subject to certain baskets and exceptions. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of September 25, 2021.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of acquired trade names and trademarks. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized for an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life if its carrying value exceeds its fair value.\nMost of our goodwill is associated with our Pet segment. In connection with our annual goodwill impairment testing performed during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, we made a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it was necessary to calculate the estimated fair values of our reporting units under the quantitative goodwill impairment test. We completed our\n(1)During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we issued $500 aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due October 2030. We used a portion of the proceeds to redeem all of our outstanding 6.125% senior notes due 2023. As a result of our redemption of the 2023 Notes, we incurred incremental expenses of approximately $10.0 million, comprised of a call premium payment of $6.1 million, overlapping interest expense of approximately $1.4 million and a $2.5 million non-cash charge for the write-off of unamortized financing costs in interest expense. These amounts are included in interest expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The estimate of fair value of each of our reporting units is based on our projection of revenues, gross margin, operating costs and cash flows considering historical and estimated future results, general economic and market conditions as well as the impact of planned business and operational strategies. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Assumptions critical to our fair value estimates were: (i) discount rates used in determining the fair value of the reporting units; (ii) estimated future cash flows; and (iii) projected revenue and operating profit growth rates used in the reporting unit models. Actual results may differ from those estimates. The valuations employ present value techniques to measure fair value and consider market factors.\nNet Interest Expense\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $851.3 million from $48.1 million in fiscal 2020 to $899.4 million in fiscal 2021. The increase in cash used in investing activities was due primarily to acquisition activity and an increase in capital expenditures of approximately $37 million in the current year compared to the prior year, partially offset by proceeds received from the sale of our Breeder's Choice business during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and decreased investments in the current year compared to the prior year. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we acquired DoMyOwn for approximately $81 million. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we acquired Hopewell Nursery on December 31, 2020 for approximately $81 million and Green Garden Products on February 11, 2021 for approximately $571 million and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we acquired D&D Commodities for approximately $88 million.\nIn fiscal 2021, our consolidated net sales were $3.3 billion, of which our Pet segment, or Pet, accounted for approximately $1.9 billion and our Garden segment, or Garden, accounted for approximately $1.4 billion. In fiscal 2021, our operating income was $254 million consisting of income from our Pet segment of $208 million, income from our Garden segment of $139 million and corporate expenses of $93 million.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nNet Sales\nFinancial summary:\n\u2022Gross profit for fiscal 2021 increased $174.3 million, or 21.9%, to $970.9 million. Gross margin declined 20 basis points in fiscal 2021 to 29.4%, from 29.6% in fiscal 2020.\nThe Guarantors jointly and severally, and fully and unconditionally, guarantee the payment of the principal and premium, if any, and interest on the 2031, 2030 and 2028 Notes when due, whether at stated maturity of the 2031, 2030 and 2028 Notes, by acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, and all other obligations of the Company to the holders of the 2031, 2030 and 2028 Notes and to the trustee under the indenture governing the 2031, 2030 and 2028 Notes (the \"Guarantee\"). The Guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of each Guarantor and are of equal rank with all other existing and future senior indebtedness of the Guarantors.\nWe have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us.\nBorrowings under the Amended Credit Facility will bear interest at an index based on LIBOR or, at our option, the Base Rate (defined as the highest of (a) the Truist prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%), plus, in either case, an applicable margin based on our consolidated senior leverage ratio and (d) 0.00%. Such applicable margin for LIBOR-based borrowings fluctuates between 1.00% and 1.50% and was 1.00% as of September 25, 2021, and such applicable margin for Base Rate borrowings fluctuates between 0.00% and 0.50% , and was 0.00% as of September 25, 2021. An unused line fee shall be payable monthly in respect of the total amount of the unutilized Lenders' commitments and short-notice borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility. Letter of credit fees at the applicable margin on the average undrawn and unreimbursed amount of letters of credit shall be payable monthly and a facing fee of 0.125% shall be paid on demand for the stated amount of each letter of credit. We are also required to pay certain fees to the administrative agent under the Amended Credit Facility. As of September 25, 2021, the applicable interest rate related to Base Rate borrowings was 3.3%, and the applicable interest rate related to one-month LIBOR-based borrowings was 1.1%.\nThe holders of the 2031 Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the 2031 Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of specific kinds of changes of control.\nFinancing Activities\nNet sales for fiscal 2021 increased $608.2 million, or 22.6%, to $3,303.7 million from $2,695.5 million in fiscal 2020. Organic net sales, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures in the last 12 months, increased $335.3 million, or 12.5% in fiscal 2021. Branded product sales increased $459.8 million, and sales of other manufacturers' products increased $148.4 million. Branded product sales include products we produce under Central brand names and products we produce under third-party brands. Sales of branded products represented 77% of our total sales in fiscal 2021 compared with 78% in fiscal 2020. Private label sales represent approximately 10% to 15% of our consolidated net sales.\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are not subject to amortization but must be evaluated for impairment.\nAs a result of our redemption of the 2023 Notes, we incurred a call premium payment of $6.1 million, overlapping interest expense for 30 days of approximately $1.4 million and a $2.5 million non-cash charge for the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 2023 Notes. These amounts are included in interest expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nWe may redeem some or all of the 2031 Notes at any time, at our option, prior to April 30, 2026 at the principal amount plus a \"make whole\" premium. At any time prior to April 30, 2024, we may also redeem, at our option, up to 40% of the notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 104.125% of the principal amount of the notes. We may redeem some or all of the 2031 Notes at our option, at any time on or after April 30, 2026 for 102.063%, on or after April 30, 2027 for 101.375%, on or after April 30, 2028 for 100.688% and on or after April 30, 2029 for 100.0%, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nwhile freight costs moderated. In fiscal 2020 and 2019, tariffs implemented during the year had a negative impact in instances where we were unable to pass through the incremental costs.\nFor a discussion of our results of operations in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, please see Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 26, 2020 filed with the SEC.\nAsset-Based Loan Facility Amendment\nThe volatility in demand, changing consumer consumption patterns, uncertainty regarding vaccination uptake and new variants of the virus make it difficult to predict when more normal order patterns may return. Forecasting and planning remain challenging in the current environment and will continue to be challenging as the pandemic eases in the future. In the current uncertain environment, our employees, customers and consumers will continue to be our priority as we manage our business to deliver long-term growth.\nD&D Commodities\nWeather and Seasonality\nWe expect that our principal sources of funds will be cash generated from our operations, proceeds from our debt and equity offerings, and, if necessary, borrowings under our $400 million asset backed loan facility. Based on our anticipated cash needs, availability under our asset backed loan facility and the scheduled maturity of our debt, we believe that our sources of liquidity should be adequate to meet our working capital, capital spending and other cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, we cannot assure you that these sources will continue to provide us with sufficient liquidity and, should we require it, that we will be able to obtain financing on terms satisfactory to us, or at all.\nOur business is seasonal and our working capital requirements and capital resources track closely to this seasonal pattern. Generally, during the first fiscal quarter, accounts receivable reach their lowest level while inventory, accounts payable and short-term borrowings begin to increase. During the second fiscal quarter, receivables, accounts payable and short-term borrowings increase, reflecting the build-up of inventory and related payables in anticipation of the peak lawn and garden selling season. During the third fiscal quarter, inventory levels remain relatively constant while accounts receivable peak and short-term borrowings start to decline as cash collections are received during the peak selling season. During the fourth fiscal quarter, inventory levels are at their lowest, and accounts receivable and payables are substantially reduced through conversion of receivables to cash.\n(3)During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge for two private company investments. The impairment was recorded as part of other (expense) income.\nIssuance of $400 million 4.125% Senior Notes due 2031\nThe Amended Credit Facility is subject to a borrowing base that is calculated using a formula based upon eligible receivables and inventory minus certain reserves and adjustments. The Amended Credit Facility also allows the Company to add real property to the borrowing base so long as the real property is subject to a first priority lien in favor of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders. Net availability under the Amended Credit Facility was $400 million as of September 25, 2021. The Amended Credit Facility includes a $50 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and an increased $40 million sublimit for short-notice borrowings. We incurred approximately $1.6 million of debt issuance costs in conjunction with this transaction, which included underwriter fees and legal expenses. The debt issuance costs are being amortized over the term of the Amended Credit Facility. As of September 25, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding and no letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility. There were other letters of credit of $1.5 million outstanding as of September 25, 2021.\nCOVID-19 Impact\nFiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWarehouse and administrative expense increased $56.3 million, or 19.0%, to $352.7 million in fiscal 2021 and decreased as a percentage of net sales to 10.7% in fiscal 2021 from 11.0% in fiscal 2020. The increased expense was driven by the addition of the four recent acquisitions in the Garden segment and a $2.6 million loss in our Pet segment resulting from the sale of the Breeder's Choice business in our fiscal 2021 first quarter. Additionally, both operating segments experienced increased labor and payroll-related expense from wage inflation. Corporate expenses increased $3.6 million due primarily to increased variable compensation, payroll expense and increased non-cash equity compensation expense.\nThe obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee shall be limited to the maximum amount as well, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor and to any collections from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such Guarantor under the guarantee not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under Federal or state law.\nOur net income for fiscal 2021 was $151.7 million, or $2.75 per diluted share, compared to $120.7 million, or $2.20 per diluted share, for fiscal 2020. The fiscal 2021 25.0% improvement in earnings per diluted share was due to strong revenue growth and operating margin improvement.\n\u2022Loss on sale of business: we have excluded the impact of the loss on the sale of a business as it represents an infrequent transaction that occurs in limited circumstances that impacts the comparability between operating periods. We believe the adjustment of this loss supplements the GAAP information with a measure that may be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance.\nThe 2028 Notes contain customary high-yield covenants, including covenants limiting debt incurrence and restricted payments, subject to certain baskets and exceptions. We were in compliance with all covenants as of September 25, 2021.\n\u2022Net sales for fiscal 2021 increased $608.2 million, or 22.6%, to $3,303.7 million, with organic net sales increasing $335.3 million and sales from our four recent acquisitions of $272.9 million. Our Pet segment sales increased 12.9%, and our Garden segment sales increased 38.5%.\nDuring fiscal 2021, inflation was broad-based and we saw significant increases across commodity and material costs, freight and labor. During fiscal 2020, we saw more moderate increases to commodity, labor and freight costs. During fiscal 2019, commodity costs increased\nIn April 2021, we issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due April 2031 (the \"2031 Notes\"). We used the net proceeds from the offering to repay all outstanding borrowings under our Amended Credit Facility, with the remainder to be used for general corporate purposes.\nWe incurred approximately $8.0 million of debt issuance costs associated with this transaction, which included underwriter fees and legal, accounting and rating agency expenses. The debt issuance costs are being amortized over the term of the 2030 Notes.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAlthough not all inclusive, we believe that the following represent the more critical accounting policies, which are subject to estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nDuring fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, we performed evaluations of the fair value of our indefinite-lived trade names and trademarks. Our expected revenues were based on our future operating plan and market growth or decline estimates for future years. No impairment was indicated during our fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 analyses of our indefinite-lived trade names and trademarks.\nIn October 2020, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due October 2030 (the \"2030 Notes\"). In November 2020, we used a portion of the net proceeds to redeem all of our outstanding 6.125% senior notes due November 2023 (the \"2023 Notes\") at a redemption price of 101.531% plus accrued and unpaid interest, and to pay related fees and expenses, with the remainder for general corporate purposes.\nTotal Debt\nFiscal Year 2021 Acquisitions\nIntangible assets\nWe have financed our growth through a combination of internally generated funds, bank borrowings, supplier credit, and sales of equity and debt securities to the public.\nOur effective income tax rate was 21.6% for fiscal 2021 compared to 21.0% for fiscal 2020. The increased effective income tax rate in fiscal 2021 was due primarily to a decrease in benefit from income tax credits and an increase in taxable foreign earnings.\nWe incurred approximately $4.6 million of debt issuance costs in conjunction with this transaction, which included underwriter fees and legal, accounting and rating agency expenses. The debt issuance costs are being amortized over the term of the 2028 notes.\nHopewell Nursery\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have acquired a large number of businesses in the past, and we anticipate that we will continue to evaluate potential acquisition candidates in the future. If one or more potential acquisition opportunities, including those that would be material, become available in the near future, we may require additional external capital. In addition, such acquisitions would subject us to the general risks associated with acquiring companies, particularly if the acquisitions are relatively large.\nWe service two broad markets: pet supplies and lawn and garden supplies. Our pet supplies businesses involve products that have a year round selling cycle with a slight degree of seasonality. As a result, it is not necessary to maintain large quantities of inventory to meet peak demands. Our lawn and garden businesses are highly seasonal with approximately 69% of our Garden segment's net sales occurring during the second and third fiscal quarters. This seasonality requires the shipment of large quantities of product well ahead of the peak consumer buying periods. To encourage retailers and distributors to stock large quantities of inventory, industry practice has been for manufacturers to give extended credit terms and/or promotional discounts.\nIn April 2021, Central (the \"Parent/Issuer\") issued $400 million of 2031 Notes. In October 2020, Central issued $500 million of 2030 Notes. In December 2017, Central issued $300 million of 2028 Notes. The 2031 Notes, 2030 Notes and 2028 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior basis by each of our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries (the \"Guarantors\"), which are borrowers under or guarantors of our senior secured revolving credit facility (\"Credit Facility\"). The 2031 Notes, 2030 Notes and 2028 Notes are unsecured senior obligations and are subordinated to all of our existing and future secured debt, including our Credit Facility, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the Guarantors to make distributions to the Parent/Issuer. Certain subsidiaries and operating divisions of the Company do not guarantee the 2031, 2030 or 2028 Notes and are referred to as the Non-Guarantors.\nThe holders of the 2030 Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the 2030 Notes at a purchase price equal to 101.0% of the principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of a change of control.\nChanges in the judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment, including expected future cash flows and discount rates, could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units in the future and could result in additional impairment of goodwill.\nNet Income and Earnings Per Share\nGarden net sales increased $391.3 million, or 38.5%, to $1,408.8 million in fiscal 2021 from $1,017.5 million in fiscal 2020. Organic sales increased $99.5 million, or 9.8%, and sales from our recent acquisitions of DoMyOwn, Hopewell Nursery, Green Garden Products and D&D Commodities contributed $291.8 million. The increased organic sales were broad-based across our entire Garden portfolio, including sales increases in sales of other manufacturers' products, wild bird feed, live plants and controls and fertilizers. We believe the sales increase across our Garden portfolio was driven in significant part by increased consumer home gardening related to the pandemic and retailer listing gains. The organic sales increase was primarily volume driven but was also aided by price increases necessitated by the current inflationary cost environment, especially in our wild bird feed business. Garden branded sales increased $283.5 million and sales of other manufacturers' products increased $107.8 million.\nWe believe that cash flows from operating activities, funds available under our asset backed loan facility, and arrangements with suppliers will be adequate to fund our presently anticipated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our capital expenditures, which are related primarily to replacements and expansion of and upgrades to plant and equipment and also investment in our continued implementation of a scalable enterprise-wide information technology platform, will be approximately $80 million - $90 million over the next 12 months.\nWe incurred approximately $6 million of debt issuance costs in conjunction with this issuance, which included underwriter fees and legal, accounting and rating agency expenses. The debt issuance costs are being amortized over the term of the 2031 Notes.\nIn the Pet segment, gross profit increased due to increased sales, favorable product mix and productivity gains, partially offset by significant inflationary headwinds.\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $481.0 million from $60.6 million of cash used in fiscal 2020 to $420.5 million of cash provided in fiscal 2021. The increase in cash provided by financing activities during the current year was due primarily to the issuance of $500 million of our 2030 Notes in October 2020 and $400 million of our 2031 Notes in April 2021, partially offset by the repayment of our 2023 Notes and the corresponding premium paid on extinguishment as well as debt issuance costs incurred on the issuances of the 2030 Notes and 2031 Notes. We also decreased open market purchases of our common stock during the current year period as compared to the prior year. During fiscal 2021, the Company repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares of its non-voting common stock (CENTA) on the open market at an aggregate cost of approximately $21.8 million, or $41.91 per share, in addition to $8.2 million used for minimum statutory tax withholdings related to the net share settlement of our stock.\nCentral Garden & Pet Company is a leading innovator, producer and distributor of branded and private label products for the lawn & garden and pet supplies markets in the United States.\n(3)Contracts for purchases of grains, grass seed and pet food ingredients, used primarily to mitigate risk associated with increases in market prices and commodity availability, may obligate us to make future purchases based on estimated yields. The terms of these contracts vary; some having fixed prices or quantities, others having variable pricing and quantities. For certain agreements, management estimates are used to develop the quantities and pricing for anticipated purchases, and future purchases could vary significantly from such estimates.\nSelling and delivery expense increased $61.5 million, or 20.4%, to $363.7 million in fiscal 2021 but decreased as a percentage of net sales from 11.2% in fiscal 2020 to 11.0% in fiscal 2021. The increase in selling and delivery expense was due primarily to the addition of our four fiscal 2021 acquisitions, increased delivery expense resulting from increased sales volumes and higher shipping costs, and increased headcount and marketing investments for market research, brand development and innovation. The decline in selling and delivery expense as a percentage of net sales was due primarily to improved overhead absorption.\nThe following is management's discussion of the financial results, liquidity and other key items related to our performance. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those indicated in forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A - Risk Factors.\u201d\n\nThe pandemic and related increase in demand have created operational challenges, which have impacted our service and fill rates. In our supply chain, we may continue to experience increased operational and logistics costs. We may also experience additional disruptions in our supply chain as the pandemic continues, although we cannot reasonably estimate the potential impact or timing of those events, and we may not be able to mitigate such impact. We continue to face supply constraints of commodities, material and freight and the limited availability of labor and inflationary pressures stemming from the COVID-19 operating environment, including notable increases in costs for key commodities, material, labor and freight.\nThe Guarantee of a Guarantor will be released:\nThe 2028 Notes require semiannual interest payments on February 1 and August 1, which commenced on August 1, 2018. The 2028 Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries who are borrowers under or guarantors of our senior secured revolving credit facility or who guarantee the 2023 Notes.\nWe may redeem some or all of the 2030 Notes at any time, at our option, prior to October 15, 2025 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a make-whole\u201d premium. Prior to October 15, 2023, we may redeem up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 104.125% of the principal amount of the notes. We may redeem some or all of the 2030 Notes, at our option, in whole or in part, at any time on or after October 15, 2025 for 102.063%, on or after October 15, 2026 for 101.375%, on or after October 15, 2027 for 100.688% and on or after October 15, 2028 for 100.0%, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\n(1) The product category was less than 10% of our consolidated net sales in the period.\nContractual Obligations\nGarden operating income increased $23.3 million, or 20.2%, to $138.8 million for fiscal 2021. The increase was due to increased sales and higher gross profit partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses. Garden operating margin declined 150 basis points to 9.8% due primarily to higher selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales and the initial inventory-related impact of purchase accounting from our four recent acquisitions.\n\n(4)Possible performance-based payments associated with prior acquisitions of businesses are not included in the above table, because they are based on future performance of the businesses acquired, which is not yet known. Performance-based payments of approximately $0.4 million were made in fiscal 2021 related to Hydro-Organics Wholesale, Inc. Potential performance-based periods extend through fiscal 2025 for Hydro-Organics Wholesale, Inc. Payments are capped at $1.0 million per year related to Hydro-Organics Wholesale, Inc.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the relative percentages that certain income and expense items bear to net sales: \nIn the Garden segment, gross profit increased due to increased sales, including the inorganic contribution of the four recent acquisitions and gross productivity efforts, partially offset by heightened costs across commodities, freight and labor.\n\nRefer to the discussion under Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements.\nFiscal 2021 Financial Highlights\nCritical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments\nThe non-GAAP adjustments made reflect the following:\n\nOperating Activities\nSummarized Financial Information for Guarantors and the Issuer of Guaranteed Securities\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has led to adverse impacts on human health, the global economy and society at large. From the beginning, our priority has been the safety of our employees, customers and consumers.\nGreen Garden Products\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n(2)Estimated interest payments to be made on our 2028 Notes, our 2030 Notes and our 2031 Notes. See Note 11 - Long-Term Debt to the consolidated financial statements for description of interest rate terms.\n(2)During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we recognized a loss of $2.6 million, included in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations, from the sale of our Breeder's Choice business unit after concluding it was not a strategic business for our Pet segment.\nIn February 2019, the Board of Directors authorized us to make supplemental purchases to minimize dilution resulting from issuances under our equity compensation plans (the \"Equity Dilution Authorization\"). In addition to our regular share repurchase program, we are permitted to purchase annually a number of shares equal to the number of shares of restricted stock or stock options granted in the prior fiscal year, to the extent not already repurchased, and the current fiscal year. The Equity Dilution Authorization has no fixed expiration date and expires when the Board withdraws its authorization. As of September 26, 2021, we had authorization remaining from the fiscal 2021 equity plan activity to repurchase up to 1.2 million shares under our Equity Dilution Authorization.\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe 2031 Notes require semi-annual interest payments on April 30 and October 30, which commenced October 30, 2021. The 2031 Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by each of our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries which are borrowers under or guarantors of our Amended Credit Facility. The 2031 Notes were issued in a private placement under Rule 144A and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933.\nWe report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). However, to supplement the financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EBITDA, organic sales; and non-GAAP net income and diluted net income per share. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of specific items (described below) may be useful to investors in their assessment of our ongoing operating performance and provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods.\nGross profit for fiscal 2021 increased $174.3 million, or 21.9%, to $970.9 million from $796.6 million in fiscal 2020. Both Garden and Pet contributed to the increase in gross profit. The decline in gross margin was due to significant cost inflation and the impact of inventory-related purchase accounting which was largely offset by price increases and productivity gains. Both segments are being impacted by the rapidly increasing cost environment where we are seeing widespread inflation across commodities (e.g., sunflower, milo, millet and foam), freight and labor. We intend to seek price increases to offset continued inflationary pressures but do not anticipate we will be able to fully offset the cost pressures in fiscal 2022.\nAt September 25, 2021, our total debt outstanding was $1,185.8 million versus $694.1 million at September 26, 2020.\nGross Profit\nOperating Income\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are primarily tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital, and assumed royalty rates. Future net sales and short-term growth rates are estimated for trade names based on management's forecasted financial results which consider key business drivers such as specific revenue growth initiatives, market share changes and general economic factors such as consumer spending.\nThe 2030 Notes contain customary high yield covenants, including covenants limiting debt incurrence and restricted payments, subject to certain baskets and exceptions. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of September 25, 2021.\n\u2022Incremental expenses from note redemption and issuance: we have excluded the impact of the incremental expenses incurred from the note redemption and issuance as they represent an infrequent transaction that occurs in limited circumstances that impacts the comparability between operating periods. We believe the adjustment of these expenses supplements the GAAP information with a measure that may be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance.\nFiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019\nDuring fiscal 2021, the Company repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares of its non-voting common stock (CENTA) on the open market at an aggregate cost of approximately $21.8 million, or $41.91 per share. In August 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program to purchase up to $100 million of our common stock (the \"2019 Repurchase Authorization\"). The 2019 Repurchase Authorization has no fixed expiration date and expires when the amount authorized has been used or the Board withdraws its authorization. As of September 25, 2021, no repurchases had been made under the $100 million 2019 Repurchase Authorization.\nSenior Notes\nOther income (expense) is comprised of income or loss from investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting, including any associated impairments of investments and foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Other expense was $1.5 million for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021 compared to $4.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 26, 2020, due primarily to a $3.6 million impairment in fiscal 2020 of two investments in private companies impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOrganic Net Sales Reconciliation\nBusiness Overview\n$300 Million, 5.125% Senior Notes due 2028\nDoMyOwn\nCentral has been impacted by COVID-19 in a number of ways, including increased demand evidenced by our organic net sales increase of 13% in fiscal year 2021. The increased demand for our products continues to challenge our supply chain and our ability to procure and manufacture enough product to meet the continued high levels of demand. At some of our facilities, we have experienced reduced productivity and increased employee absences, which we expect to continue during the balance of the pandemic. Our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are currently open and fully operational. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs including personal protective equipment and sanitation costs. We have hosted mobile vaccination clinics at some of our larger manufacturing and distribution sites, in order to make vaccines available to our employees.\nStock Repurchases\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $117.8 million, or 19.7%, from $598.6 million in fiscal 2020 to $716.4 million in fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 22.2% in fiscal 2020 to 21.7% in fiscal 2021; both the Pet segment and corporate contributed to the improvement. Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales increased in the Garden segment due to the four fiscal 2021 acquisitions which include the amortization of the intangible assets resulting from purchase accounting. Corporate expenses are included within administrative expense and relate to the costs of unallocated executive, administrative, finance, legal, human resource, and information technology functions.\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Estimates and assumptions are required for, but are not limited to, accounts receivable and inventory realizable values, fixed asset lives, long-lived asset valuation and impairments, intangible asset lives, stock-based compensation, deferred and current income taxes, self-insurance accruals and the impact of contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the result of which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n(2) if such Guarantor merges with and into the Company, with the Company surviving such merger;\nOur sales of lawn and garden products are influenced by weather and climate conditions in the different markets we serve. Our Garden segment's business is highly seasonal. In fiscal 2021, approximately 69% of our Garden segment's net sales and 60% of our total net sales occurred during our second and third fiscal quarters. Substantially all of the Garden segment's operating income is typically generated in this period, which has historically offset the operating loss incurred during the first fiscal quarter of the year.\nNon-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items:\nOn June 30, 2021, the Company purchased D&D Commodities, Ltd. (\"D&D\"), a provider of high-quality, premium bird feed, for approximately $88 million in cash and the assumption of approximately $30 million of long-term debt. The addition of D&D expands Central's portfolio in the bird feed category and is expected to deepen the Company's relationship with major retailers.\nChange in Segment Components\nIn connection with businesses we acquire, management must determine the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Considerable judgment and estimates are required to determine such amounts, particularly as they relate to identifiable intangible assets, and the applicable useful lives related thereto. Under different assumptions, the resulting valuations could be materially different, which could materially impact the operating results we report.\nInvesting Activities\nThe table below presents our significant contractual cash obligations by fiscal year: \nBanks currently reporting information used to set LIBOR will stop doing so after 2021. Various parties, including government agencies, are seeking to identify an alternative rate to replace LIBOR. We are monitoring their efforts, and we will likely amend contracts to accommodate any replacement rate where it is not already provided. Our Amended Credit Facility already anticipates the potential loss of LIBOR and defines procedures for establishing a replacement rate.\nCorporate expenses increased $3.6 million due primarily to increased variable compensation, payroll expense and increased non-cash equity compensation expense.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $28.2 million from $76.3 million in fiscal 2019 to $48.1 million in fiscal 2020. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was due primarily to acquisition activity in the prior year, partially offset by an $11.5 million increase in capital expenditures in the current year compared to the prior year. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we acquired the remaining 55% interest in Arden Companies for approximately $11 million, and during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 we acquired C&S Products for approximately $30 million.\nAs of September 25, 2021, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $0.3 million. These amounts have been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we began reporting the results of our outdoor cushion operations in the Pet segment as a result of a change in internal management reporting lines due to potential synergies in sourcing, manufacturing and innovation and to be consistent with the reporting of financial information used to assess performance and allocate resources. These operations were previously reported in the Garden segment and are now managed and reported in the Pet segment. All prior period segment disclosures have been recast to reflect this segment change.\nWe have also provided organic net sales, a non-GAAP measure that excludes the impact of businesses purchased or exited in the prior 12 months, because we believe it permits investors to better understand the performance of our historical business without the impact of recent acquisitions or dispositions.\n\n(3) if the Guarantor is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary; or\n\u2022Our operating income increased $56.5 million, or 28.5%, to $254.5 million in fiscal 2021, and as a percentage of net sales improved to 7.7% from 7.3% in fiscal 2020.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nGoodwill\nThe reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are shown in the tables below. We believe that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and other users of our financial statements, by allowing for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operating performance. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating our performance, and we believe these measures similarly may be useful to investors in evaluating our financial and operating performance and the trends in our business from management's point of view. While our management believes that non-GAAP measurements are useful supplemental information, such adjusted results are not intended to replace our GAAP financial results and should be read in conjunction with those GAAP results.\nOperating income increased $56.5 million, or 28.5%, to $254.5 million in fiscal 2021 from $198.0 million in fiscal 2020. Our operating margin was 7.7% in fiscal 2021, increasing from 7.3% in fiscal 2020. Increased sales of $608.2 million and a 50 basis point decrease in selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales were partially offset by a 20 basis point decline in gross margin. Both operating income and margin were favorably impacted by significant pandemic-related increases in demand for our products.\nqualitative assessment of potential goodwill impairment and it was determined that it was more likely than not the fair values of our reporting units were greater than their carrying amounts, and accordingly, no further testing of goodwill was required.\nThe holders of the 2028 Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the 2028 Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of a change of control.\n(1)Excludes $1.5 million of outstanding letters of credit related to normal business transactions. Debt repayments do not reflect the unamortized portion of deferred financing costs associated with the 2028 Notes, 2030 Notes and 2031 Notes of approximately $16.0 million as of September 25, 2021, of which, $2.9 million is amortizable until February 2028, $7.3 million is amortizable until October 2030 and $5.8 million is amortizable until April 2031, and is included in the carrying value of the long-term debt. See Note 11 - Long-Term Debt to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of long-term debt.\n(4) if the Company exercises its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option or the discharge of the Company's obligations under the indentures in accordance with the terms of the indentures.\nWe believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs with our cash and revolving credit facility as we manage through the current economic and health environment.\nOur contractual commitments are presented under the caption Liquidity and Capital Resources.\nResults of Operations (GAAP)\nWe may redeem some or all of the 2028 Notes at any time, at our option, prior to January 1, 2023 at the principal amount plus a \"make whole\" premium. We may redeem some or all of the 2028 Notes at our option, at any time on or after January 1, 2023 for 102.563% on or after January 1, 2024 for 101.708%, on or after January 1, 2025 for 100.854% and on or after January 1, 2026 for 100% plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nIssuance of $500 million 4.125% Senior Notes due 2030 and Redemption of $400 million 6.125% Senior Notes due 2023\nThe Amended Credit Facility continues to contain customary covenants, including financial covenants which require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00:1.00 upon triggered quarterly testing (e.g. when availability falls below certain thresholds established in the agreement), reporting requirements and events of default. The Amended Credit Facility is secured by substantially all assets of the borrowing parties. We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Amended Credit Facility during the period ended September 25, 2021.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nWe have provided organic net sales, a non-GAAP measure that excludes the impact of recent acquisitions and dispositions, because we believe it permits investors to better understand the performance of our historical business. We define organic net sales as net sales from our historical business derived by excluding the net sales from businesses acquired or exited in the preceding 12 months. After an acquired business has been part of our consolidated results for 12 months, the change in net sales thereafter is considered part of the increase or decrease in organic net sales. \nFrom time to time in the future, there may be other items that we may exclude if we believe that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management.\nRecent Developments\nThe following tables present summarized financial information of the Parent/Issuer subsidiaries and the Guarantor subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions between subsidiaries under Parent/Issuer and subsidiaries under the Guarantor have been eliminated. The information presented below excludes eliminations necessary to arrive at the information on a consolidated basis. In presenting the summarized financial statements, the equity method of accounting has been applied to the Parent/Issuer's interests in the Guarantor Subsidiaries. The summarized information excludes financial information of the Non-Guarantors, including earnings from and investments in these entities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $13.5 million, from $264.3 million in fiscal 2020 to $250.8 million in fiscal 2021. The decrease in cash provided was due primarily to changes in our working capital accounts, primarily an increase in inventory from an intentional build-up due to the overall increased demand for our products, as compared to the prior year.\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased $50.2 million from $110.8 million of cash provided in fiscal 2019 to $60.6 million cash used in fiscal 2020. The decrease in cash used in financing activities during the current year was due primarily to our repayment of approximately $46 million of acquired long-term debt subsequent to our acquisitions of Arden and C&S Products during fiscal 2019, as well as decreased open market purchases of our common stock during the current year. During fiscal 2020, we repurchased approximately 0.2 million shares of our voting common stock (CENT) at an aggregate cost of approximately $6.6 million, or approximately $26.63 per share, and 1.8 million shares of our non-voting Class A common stock (CENTA) at an aggregate cost of approximately $45.7 million, or approximately $25.90 per share, in addition to $6.9 million used for minimum statutory tax withholdings related to the net share settlement of our stock.\nNet interest expense increased $18.2 million, or 45.5%, from $40.0 million in fiscal 2020 to $58.2 million in fiscal 2021. In October 2020, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due October 2030 and used the proceeds to redeem all of our outstanding aggregate principal amount 6.125% senior notes due 2023 with the remainder available for general corporate purposes. As a result of our redemption of the 2023 Notes, we recognized incremental interest expense of approximately $10.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Also contributing to the increase in net interest expense was a higher debt balance during fiscal 2021. In April 2021, we issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due April 2031. We used a portion of the net proceeds to repay outstanding amounts under our senior secured revolving credit facility, with the remainder available for general corporate purposes.\nOn December 14, 2017, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due February 2028 (the \"2028 Notes\"). We will use the net proceeds from the offering to finance future acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined by us as income before income tax, net other expense, net interest expense and depreciation and amortization (or operating income plus depreciation and amortization expense). We present adjusted EBITDA because we believe that adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplemental measure in evaluating the cash flows and performance of our business and provides greater transparency into our results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA is used by our management to perform such evaluation. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for cash flow from operations, income from operations or other income statement measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies, many of which present adjusted EBITDA when reporting their results. Other companies may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently and it may not be comparable.\nInflation", "item_7_tables": "Table 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>
