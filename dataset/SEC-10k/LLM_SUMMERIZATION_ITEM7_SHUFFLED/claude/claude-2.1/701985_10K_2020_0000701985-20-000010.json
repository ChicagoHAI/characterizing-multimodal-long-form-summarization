MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") as codified in the Accounting Standards Codification. The following information should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOur operating results are generally impacted by economic changes and, therefore, we monitor the retail environment using, among other things, certain key industry performance indicators including competitor performance and mall traffic data. These can provide insight into consumer spending patterns and shopping behavior in the current retail environment and assist us in assessing our performance as well as the potential impact of industry trends on our future operating results. Additionally, we evaluate a number of key performance indicators including comparable sales, gross profit, operating income and other performance metrics such as sales per average selling square foot and inventory per selling square foot in assessing our performance.\nExecutive Overview\nBeginning in 2018, we began making significant changes in our business to focus resources on core categories to enhance performance and accelerate growth. In 2018, these actions included:\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Closing Henri Bendel;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Selling the La Senza business; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Reducing our regular dividend.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Further, on February 20, 2020, we announced the sale of 55% of the Victoria's Secret business to Sycamore for proceeds of approximately $525 million. The transaction is designed to best position our brands for long-term success and drive shareholder value, and we believe this transaction will highlight the value and performance of the standalone Bath & Body Works business, enhance management focus and reduce structural complexity.\nWe have a multi-year goal to grow Bath & Body Works and increase operating margins by focusing on these key business priorities:\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Grow our business in North America;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Extend our brand internationally; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Focus on the fundamentals of our business.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We also continue to focus on:\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Attracting and retaining top talent;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Maintaining a strong cash and liquidity position while optimizing our capital structure; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Returning value to our shareholders.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The following is a discussion regarding certain of our key business priorities:\nGrow our business in North America\nThe core assortment of Bath & Body Works is body care, home fragrance products, soaps and sanitizers, which together make up the majority of sales and profits for the business. We see clear opportunities for substantial growth in these categories by focusing on product newness and innovation and expanding into under-penetrated market and price segments. We will continue to invest in the White Barn concept, which continues to yield strong results. In 2020, we plan to increase our square footage at Bath & Body Works North America through the opening of new Bath & Body Works stores, substantially in off-mall locations, and the remodeling of existing stores.\nOur Bath & Body Works direct business, with over $950 million in sales and an operating margin in excess of 20%, grew sales by 32% over last year. We continue to invest in direct channel fulfillment to further accelerate growth.\nExtend our brand internationally\nWe believe there is substantial opportunity for international growth. We have a separate, dedicated team that has taken a methodical, \"test and learn\" approach to expansion. We plan to expand our presence outside of North America by increasing the number of stores operated by our international partners. Our partners opened 43 net new Bath & Body Works stores in 2019, bringing the total in the Middle East, Latin America, Southeast Asia and Europe to 278 stores. Our partners plan to open additional stores in 2020.\nFocus on the fundamentals of our business\nWe are focused on the fundamentals of our business which include knowing our customers, focusing on core merchandise categories, inventory management, speed and agility, managing real estate and store selling and execution. In terms of speed and agility, we are focused on inventory discipline through lead-time reductions and in-season agility to increase sales and reduce promotional activity. In terms of real estate, we will continue to proactively and rigorously review our portfolio, and we will continue to open and close stores when we believe it makes sense to do so. Finally, we continue to optimize our store selling and execution by concentrating on a better store experience and developing, retaining and investing in talented, trained and productive store associates.\n2019 Overview\nL Brands' overall financial performance in 2019 was below our expectations. Operating income declined as growth at Bath & Body Works was more than offset by declines at Victoria's Secret. Our net sales decreased $323 million to $12.914 billion primarily driven by Victoria's Secret and the sale of La Senza and closure of Henri Bendel in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our operating income decreased $979 million to $258 million, primarily due to Victoria's Secret underperformance, and goodwill and long-lived store asset impairment charges. Our operating income rate decreased to 2.0% from 9.3%.\nAt Bath & Body Works, an aligned, experienced leadership team and strong customer response to our merchandise assortments, driven by a close connection to our customer and a fast and agile supply chain, resulted in another record year, on top of a record 2018. In 2019, Bath & Body Works' comparable sales increased 10% and operating income increased 11%. Sales in the digital\nchannel increased 32%. We ended the year with more than 800 newly remodeled stores, which include the White Barn store design. These stores present a new, compelling store experience for the brand and customers alike, driving sales growth.\nVictoria's Secret underperformed in 2019. Reduced traffic resulted in increased promotion that negatively impacted margin rates. Victoria's Secret segment comparable sales declined 7% for the year, and operating income declined to a loss of $616 million, due to a $690 million goodwill impairment charge and sales and margin underperformance.\nIn Victoria's Secret Lingerie, comparable sales declined in the high-single digit range in 2019, and the merchandise margin rate declined significantly. In the fourth quarter, we continued to pull back on promotional activity in bras, and while sales were down significantly, the merchandise margin rate was up. Sleepwear performance was below our expectations, with sales and merchandise margin rate down significantly to last year.\nPINK comparable sales declined in the low-double digit range in 2019, and the merchandise margin rate declined significantly. Growth in bras and panties was more than offset by a decline in apparel, particularly in tops.\nVictoria's Secret Beauty had a good year and a solid holiday performance, with positive low-single digit comparable sales and an improvement in the merchandise margin rate.\nOutside North America, we opened 59 net new stores in 2019, ending the year with 812 stores. Revenue in our international segment was about flat in 2019 compared to last year, and the operating loss increased by $199 million, primarily driven by store asset and goodwill impairment charges in Greater China.\nFor additional information related to our 2019 financial performance, see Results of Operations - 2019 Compared to 2018.\u201d\nWe are committed to returning value to our shareholders. During 2019, we paid $332 million in dividends. We use cash flow generated from operating and financing activities to fund our dividends and share repurchase programs. Since 2000, we have returned approximately $21 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nAdjusted Financial Information\nIn addition to our results provided in accordance with GAAP above and throughout this Form 10-K, provided below are non-GAAP measurements which present operating income, net income and earnings per share in 2019, 2018 and 2017 on an adjusted basis, which remove certain special items. We believe that these special items are not indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and nature. We use adjusted financial information as key performance measures of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Instead, we believe that the presentation of adjusted financial information provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. Further, our definition of adjusted financial information may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. The table below reconciles the GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures.

The transaction is the result of a comprehensive review of a broad range of options undertaken by our Board of Directors, with input from outside financial advisors, designed to best position our brands for long-term success and drive shareholder value. We believe this transaction will highlight the value and performance of the standalone Bath & Body Works business, enhance management focus and reduce structural complexity.\nAdditionally, we believe that a private entity structure creates the best environment for a Victoria's Secret turnaround. We believe that Sycamore, which has substantial experience in the retail industry, will bring a new perspective and greater focus to the business. We are pleased that, by retaining a significant ownership stake, our shareholders will have the ability to meaningfully participate in the upside potential of this iconic brand.\nOver the next several months, we will be reviewing the functional and corporate support required for the standalone Bath & Body Works business, with a view to simplify our existing structure, while recognizing that we will still be supporting the Victoria's Secret businesses through a Transition Services Agreement with various terms for different services, which will minimize near-term dissynergies.\nThe management team, in conjunction with our Board, will also be evaluating the capital structure and cash priorities for the standalone Bath & Body Works business.\nUpon the Closing, which is expected to occur in the second quarter, Leslie H. Wexner will step down as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board to become Chairman Emeritus, remaining as a member of the Board. Andrew Meslow, Chief Executive Officer of Bath & Body Works, will be appointed by the Board as the Chief Executive Officer of L Brands, Inc. and as a director of L Brands, Inc., effective upon the Closing. Sarah E. Nash, a member of the Board, will be appointed as the Chair of the Board effective upon the Closing.\nThe global retail sector and our business continue to face an uncertain environment and, as a result, we will continue to manage our business thoughtfully, and we will focus on the execution of the retail fundamentals.\nAt the same time, we are aggressively focusing on bringing compelling merchandise assortments, marketing and store and online experiences to our customers. We will look for, and seek to capitalize on, those opportunities available to us.\nWe are closely monitoring the outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus that was first detected in Wuhan, China and has since spread globally. The coronavirus has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a pandemic,\u201d has spread to many countries, including the U.S., and is impacting worldwide economic activity. A public health epidemic, including the coronavirus, poses the risk that we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, and other business partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an unknown period of time. Related industries in the U.S. and across the\nworld may be adversely affected, including manufacturing and textile production. The situation and preventative or protective actions that governments around the world have taken to contain the spread of the coronavirus have resulted in a period of disruption, including closure of stores where our products are sold, limited store operating hours, reduced customer traffic and consumer spending, labor shortages and delays in manufacturing and shipping of products and raw materials in the U.S., China and other countries. To the extent the impact of the coronavirus continues or worsens, we may have difficulty obtaining the materials necessary for the manufacturing of our products, factories which produce our products may remain closed for sustained periods of time, and industry-wide shipment of products may be negatively impacted. Further, if the impact of the coronavirus continues or worsens, consumer behavior may be altered for an extended period of time which would impact our cash and liquidity and financial condition. The coronavirus and resulting economic disruption has also led to significant volatility in the capital markets and may adversely impact our stock price and ability to access cash. Any one adverse effect of the coronavirus, or a combination of adverse effects, could materially impact our results and financial condition.\nThese recent developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additional information on this risk and other uncertainties and factors, is set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nCompany-Owned Store Data\nThe following table compares 2019 company-owned store data to the comparable periods for 2018 and 2017:\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td>

The percentage change in comparable store sales represents the change in sales at comparable stores only and excludes the change in sales from our direct channels. The change in comparable sales provides an indication of period over period growth (decline). A store is typically included in the calculation of comparable sales when it has been open 12 months or more and it has not had a change in selling square footage of 20% or more. Additionally, stores of a given brand are excluded if total selling square footage for the brand in the mall changes by 20% or more through the opening or closing of a second store. The percentage change in comparable sales is calculated on a comparable calendar period as opposed to a fiscal basis. Therefore, the percentage change in comparable sales for 2019 and 2018 was calculated on a 52-to-52-week basis. Comparable sales attributable to our international stores are calculated on a constant currency basis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>Includes company-owned stores in the U.S. and Canada.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The results by segment are as follows:\nVictoria's Secret\nFor 2019, net sales decreased $570 million to $6.805 billion; comparable sales decreased 7%; and comparable store sales decreased 9%. Victoria's Secret Lingerie comparable sales were down in the high-single digit range, primarily due to declines in bras and apparel, driven by merchandise performance. PINK comparable sales were down in the low-double digit range, primarily driven by declines in apparel, principally in tops, due to merchandise performance and the exit of the swim business. Victoria's Secret Beauty comparable sales increased in the low-single digit range, as growth in accessories and PINK beauty were partially offset by a decline in the lip business.\nThe decrease in comparable sales was driven by declines in store traffic, average unit retail and digital conversion.\nBath & Body Works\nFor 2019, net sales increased $539 million to $5.170 billion; comparable sales increased 10%; and comparable store sales increased 5%. Net sales increased in all of our main categories including home fragrance, body care and soaps and sanitizers, which incorporated newness, innovation and fashion.\nThe increase in comparable sales was driven by increases in store conversion and digital traffic.\nVictoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International\nFor 2019, net sales decreased $5 million to $600 million due to declines in the Victoria's Secret Travel Retail business and the negative impact of foreign currency in Greater China, partially offset by the increase from new company-owned Victoria's Secret stores in Greater China.\nOther\nFor 2019, net sales decreased $287 million to $339 million primarily due to the sale of La Senza and closure of Henri Bendel in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nGross Profit\nFor 2019, our gross profit decreased $449 million to $4.450 billion, and our gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) decreased to 34.5% from 37.0% primarily as a result of:\nVictoria's Secret\nFor 2019, the gross profit decrease was primarily driven by lower merchandise margin dollars related to the decrease in net sales, partially offset by a reduction in long-lived store asset impairment charges, from $70 million in 2018 to $51 million in 2019.\nThe gross profit rate decrease was driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increased promotions to drive traffic and clear inventory, combined with buying and occupancy deleverage on lower net sales.\nBath & Body Works\nFor 2019, the gross profit increase was driven by higher merchandise margin dollars related to the increase in net sales, partially offset by higher occupancy expenses due to higher distribution and fulfillment expenses related to higher direct channel sales and investments in store real estate.\nThe gross profit rate decrease was driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increases in supply chain and sourcing costs and the sales mix shift into the direct business, which has a lower merchandise margin rate than the stores channel.\nVictoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International\nFor 2019, the gross profit decrease was primarily due to the increase in long-lived store asset impairment charges, related to stores in Greater China, the U.K. and Ireland, from $31 million in 2018 to $212 million in 2019.\nThe gross profit (loss) rate decrease was driven by the increase in long-lived store asset impairment charges.\nGeneral, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses\nFor 2019, our general, administrative and store operating expenses decreased $91 million to $3.472 billion due to the elimination of the La Senza and Henri Bendel businesses and lower marketing and store selling expenses at Victoria's Secret, partially offset by higher selling and marketing expenses related to higher sales volume at Bath & Body Works.\nThe general, administrative and store operating expense rate remained flat at 26.9% as the absence of the higher-rate La Senza and Henri Bendel businesses and declines in marketing and store selling expenses at Victoria's Secret were offset by deleverage on lower net sales.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nIn 2019, our goodwill impairment assessments concluded that the carrying values of our Victoria's Secret and Greater China reporting units exceeded their fair values. Accordingly, we recognized pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $690 million and $30 million in the Victoria's Secret and Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International segments, respectively.\nLoss on Divestiture of La Senza\nIn 2018, we recognized a pre-tax loss on the sale of La Senza of $99 million related to the recognition of $45 million of accumulated translation adjustments and the loss related to the transfer of the net working capital and long-lived store assets to the buyer.\nOther Income (Loss) and Expenses\nInterest Expense\nThe following table provides the average daily borrowings and average borrowing rates for 2019 and 2018:\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average daily borrowings (in millions)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average borrowing rate (in percentages)\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2019, our interest expense decreased $7 million to $378 million due to a lower average daily borrowings.\nOther Income (Loss)\nFor 2019, our other income (loss) decreased $66 million to a $61 million loss due to a $40 million pre-tax loss associated with the early extinguishment of $764 million in outstanding notes maturing between 2020 and 2022 and $37 million of charges to increase reserves related to ongoing contingent obligations for the La Senza business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nFor 2019, our effective tax rate was (101.9%) compared to 24.9% in 2018. The 2019 rate varied from our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the Victoria's Secret goodwill impairment charges, which generated minimal tax benefit. The 2018 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the tax effects of the divestiture of the La Senza business.\nResults of Operations-Fourth Quarter of 2019 Compared to Fourth Quarter of 2018\nThe following information summarizes our results of operations for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018.\nOperating Income\nThe following table provides our segment operating income (loss) and operating income (loss) rates (expressed as a percentage of net sales) for the fourth quarter of 2019 in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2018:\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating Income (Loss) Rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Victoria's Secret\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(543\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23.9\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bath & Body Works\n</td> <td>661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.6\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (a)\n</td> <td>(21\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(127\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25.8\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(71.0\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Operating Income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Includes sourcing and corporate functions.

The percentage change in comparable store sales represents the change in sales at comparable stores only and excludes the change in sales from our direct channels. The change in comparable sales provides an indication of period over period growth (decline). A store is typically included in the calculation of comparable sales when it has been open 12 months or more and it has not had a change in selling square footage of 20% or more. Additionally, stores of a given brand are excluded if total selling square footage for the brand in the mall changes by 20% or more through the opening or closing of a second store. The percentage change in comparable sales are calculated on a comparable calendar period as opposed to a fiscal basis. Therefore, the percentage change in comparable sales for 2019 and 2018 was calculated on a 13-to-13-week basis.

Victoria's Secret Lingerie comparable sales were down in the mid-teens as we continued to pull back promotional activity in bras, and due to merchandise performance in sleepwear. PINK comparable sales were down in the mid-teens driven by declines in apparel, principally in tops, due to merchandise performance. PINK lingerie sales were about flat to last year. Victoria's Secret Beauty comparable sales increased in the low-single digit range due to growth in prestige fragrance, driven by a strong launch of Bombshell Intense, and in PINK beauty and accessories.\nThe decrease in comparable sales was driven by declines in store traffic, average unit retail and digital conversion.\nBath & Body Works\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, net sales increased $224 million to $2.175 billion; comparable sales increased 10%; and comparable store sales increased 5%. Net sales increased in all of our main categories including home fragrance, body care and soaps and sanitizers, which incorporated newness, innovation and fashion.\nThe increase in comparable sales was driven by increases in store conversion and digital traffic.\nVictoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, net sales decreased $13 million to $177 million, due to declines in the Victoria's Secret U.K. business, partially offset by the increase from new company-owned Victoria's Secret stores in Greater China.\nOther\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, net sales decreased $100 million to $79 million due to the sale of La Senza and closure of Henri Bendel in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nGross Profit\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, our gross profit decreased $174 million to $1.794 billion, and our gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) decreased to 38.1% from 40.6% primarily as a result of:\nVictoria's Secret\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, the gross profit decrease was driven primarily by lower merchandise margin dollars related to the decrease in net sales.\nThe gross profit rate decrease was driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increased promotions to drive traffic and clear inventory, combined with buying and occupancy deleverage on lower net sales.\nBath & Body Works\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, the gross profit increase was driven by higher merchandise margin dollars related to the increase in net sales, partially offset by higher occupancy expenses due to higher distribution and fulfillment expenses related to higher direct channel sales and investments in store real estate.\nThe gross profit rate decrease was primarily driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increases in supply chain and sourcing costs and the sales mix shift into the direct business, which has a lower merchandise margin rate than the stores channel.\nVictoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, the gross profit decrease was primarily due to $35 million in long-lived store asset impairment charges recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019, which was related to the operating lease asset of a store in Greater China.\nThe gross profit rate decrease was driven by the long-lived store asset impairment charges.\nGeneral, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, our general, administrative and store operating expenses decreased $47 million to $1.022 billion due to the elimination of the La Senza and Henri Bendel businesses and lower marketing and store selling expenses at Victoria's Secret, partially offset by higher selling and marketing expenses related to higher sales volume at Bath & Body Works.\nThe general, administrative and store operating expense rate decreased to 21.7% from 22.0% driven by the absence of the higher-rate La Senza and Henri Bendel businesses.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, our annual goodwill impairment assessment concluded that the carrying value of the Victoria's Secret reporting unit exceeded its fair value. Accordingly, we recognized a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $690 million in the Victoria's Secret segment.\nLoss on Divestiture of La Senza\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized a pre-tax loss on the sale of La Senza of $99 million related to the recognition of $45 million of accumulated translation adjustments and the transfer of the net working capital and long-lived store assets to the buyer.\nOther Income (Loss) and Expense\nInterest Expense\nThe following table provides the average daily borrowings and average borrowing rates for the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018:\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average daily borrowings (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average borrowing rate (in percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, our interest expense decreased $1 million to $92 million due to lower average daily borrowings partially offset by a higher average borrowing rate.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, our effective tax rate declined compared to 24.0% in 2018. The 2019 rate varied from our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the Victoria's Secret goodwill impairment charge, which generated minimal tax benefit. The 2018 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the tax effects of the divestiture of the La Senza business.\nResults of Operations-2018 Compared to 2017\nWe utilize the retail calendar for reporting.

The 2017 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the benefit related to changes in U.S. tax legislation.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity, or access to cash, is an important factor in determining our financial stability. We are committed to maintaining adequate liquidity. Cash generated from our operating activities provides the primary resources to support current operations, growth initiatives, seasonal funding requirements and capital expenditures. Our cash provided from operations is impacted by our net income (loss) and working capital changes. Our net income (loss) is impacted by, among other things, sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, success of new product introductions, profit margins and income taxes. Historically, sales are higher during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. Generally, our need for working capital peaks during the summer and fall months as inventory builds in anticipation of the holiday period. Our cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were $265 million as of February 1, 2020.\nOn February 20, 2020, we and Sycamore entered into a definitive agreement that is intended to deliver long-term value to L Brands, Inc. shareholders by positioning Bath & Body Works as a standalone public company and transitioning Victoria's Secret, including business conducted under the Victoria's Secret and PINK brands and certain support functions, into a privately-held entity.\nAfter taking into account certain liabilities, Sycamore will purchase a 55% interest in Victoria's Secret for approximately $525 million. We intend to use the proceeds from the transaction, along with approximately $500 million of excess balance sheet cash, to reduce debt. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020, subject to customary closing conditions.\nCompany Response to Coronavirus\nSubsequent to February 1, 2020, we announced actions in response to the continued spread of the coronavirus.\nOn March 16, 2020, in an abundance of caution and as a proactive measure, we elected to borrow $950 million from our Secured Revolving Facility, leaving our availability under the Secured Revolving Facility at $22 million.\nOn March 17, 2020, we announced the temporary closure of all Bath & Body Works, Victoria's Secret and PINK stores in the United States and Canada through March 29, 2020. Associates will continue to receive pay and benefits through April 4, 2020, which is one week longer than originally announced.\nBased on the continued spread of the coronavirus and stay-at-home orders by government officials across the country, we are extending the closure of our stores beyond the initial March 29th date. As the situation continues to evolve rapidly, we are not currently able to predict the timing of store reopenings.

Our Secured Revolving Facility has certain financial covenants, including a debt to consolidated EBITDA covenant, which may be breached as early as the end of the fiscal quarter ending May 2, 2020. If we were to violate a covenant, our lenders would have the right to accelerate our Secured Revolving Facility indebtedness, demand cash collateral in respect of the letters of credit issued thereunder and terminate the funding commitments available thereunder. While we believe that we would be able to obtain temporary waivers for any such breach of a covenant to prevent an acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness or obtain a replacement credit facility, we cannot conclude with certainty that we would have the ability to obtain necessary waivers or negotiate less restrictive debt covenants with our lenders. We are in active conversations with the lenders under our credit facility to obtain a replacement credit facility that does not contain a debt to consolidated EBITDA financial covenant or a temporary waiver in respect of such financial covenant in our existing Secured Revolving Facility. We believe that our current cash balance, along with the actions taken as outlined above, provides us with sufficient current liquidity.\nWorking Capital and Capitalization\nWe believe that our available short-term and long-term capital resources are sufficient to fund foreseeable requirements.\nThe following table provides a summary of our working capital position and capitalization as of February 1, 2020, February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018:\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>February 1, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 2, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 3, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Expenditures\n</td> <td>458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>707\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working Capital (a)\n</td> <td>873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalization:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term Debt\n</td> <td>5,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shareholders' Equity (Deficit)\n</td> <td>(1,499\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(869\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(753\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Capitalization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amounts Available Under Credit Agreements (b)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>991\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>The February 1, 2020 amount includes Current Operating Lease Liabilities as a result of our adoption of ASC 842, Leases, in the first quarter of 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>Letters of credit issued reduce our availability under the Secured Revolving Facility.

The discounts and issuance costs are being amortized through the maturity date and are included within Long-term Debt on the February 1, 2020 Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nRepurchases of Notes\nIn June 2019, we completed the early settlement of tender offers to repurchase $212 million of outstanding 2020 Notes, $330 million of outstanding 2021 Notes and $96 million of outstanding 2022 Notes for $669 million. We used the proceeds from the 2029 Notes, together with cash on hand, to fund the purchase price for the tender offers. Additionally, in July 2019, we redeemed the remaining $126 million of outstanding 2020 Notes for $130 million.\nIn the second quarter of 2019, we recognized a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $40 million (after-tax loss of $30 million), which includes redemption fees and the write-off of unamortized issuance costs. This loss is included in Other Income (Loss) in the 2019 Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss).\nExchange of Notes\nIn June 2018, we completed private offers to exchange $62 million, $220 million and $44 million of outstanding 2020 Notes, 2021 Notes and 2022 Notes, respectively, for $297 million of newly issued 6.694% notes due in January 2027 (\"2027 Notes\") and $52 million in cash consideration, which included a $24 million exchange premium. The exchange was treated as a modification under ASC 470, Debt, and no gain or loss was recognized. The exchange premium is being amortized through the maturity date of January 2027 and is included within Long-term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The obligation to pay principal and interest on the 2027 Notes is jointly and severally guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by the Guarantors.\nSecured Revolving Facility\nWe and the Guarantors guarantee and pledge collateral to secure a revolving credit facility. The Secured Revolving Facility has aggregate availability of $1 billion and allows us and certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to borrow and obtain letters of credit in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, Euros, Hong Kong dollars or British pounds.\nIn August 2019, we entered into an amendment and restatement ( Amendment\u201d) of the Secured Revolving Facility. The Amendment maintained the aggregate availability under the Secured Revolving Facility at $1 billion and extended the expiration date from May 2022 to August 2024. We incurred fees related to the Amendment of $5 million, which were capitalized and are recorded in Other Assets on the February 1, 2020 Consolidated Balance Sheet and are being amortized over the remaining term of the Secured Revolving Facility.\nThe Secured Revolving Facility fees related to committed and unutilized amounts are 0.30% per annum, and the fees related to outstanding letters of credit are 1.75% per annum. In addition, the interest rate on outstanding U.S. dollar borrowings is the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") plus 1.75% per annum. The interest rate on outstanding foreign denominated borrowings is the applicable benchmark rate plus 1.75% per annum.\nThe Secured Revolving Facility contains fixed charge coverage and debt to EBITDA financial covenants. We are required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.75 to 1.00 and a consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio not exceeding 4.00 to 1.00 for the most recent four-quarter period. Additionally, the Secured Revolving Facility provides that investments and restricted payments may be made, without limitation on amount, if (a) at the time of and after giving effect to such investment or restricted payment, the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the most recent four-quarter period is less than 3.50 to 1.00 and (b) no default or event of default exists. As of February 1, 2020, we were in compliance with both of our financial covenants, and the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA was less than 3.50 to 1.00.\nDuring 2019, we borrowed and repaid $12 million under the Secured Revolving Facility. As of February 1, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Secured Revolving Facility.\nThe Secured Revolving Facility supports our letter of credit program. We had $19 million of outstanding letters of credit as of February 1, 2020 that reduced our availability under the Secured Revolving Facility.\nOn March 16, 2020, as a proactive measure in response to the continued spread of the coronavirus, we elected to borrow $950 million from the Secured Revolving Facility, leaving our availability under the Secured Revolving Facility at $22 million.\nSecured Foreign Facilities\nWe and the Guarantors guarantee and pledge collateral to secure revolving and term loan bank facilities used by certain of our Greater China subsidiaries to support their operations (\"Secured Foreign Facilities\"). The Secured Foreign Facilities have availability totaling $150 million. The interest rates on outstanding borrowings are based upon the applicable benchmark rate for each borrowing. During 2019, we borrowed $117 million and made payments of $103 million under the Secured Foreign Facilities. The maximum daily amount outstanding at any point in time in 2019 was $103 million. Borrowings on the Secured Foreign Facilities mature between March 2020 and August 2024. As of February 1, 2020, borrowings of $11 million are included within Current Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the remaining borrowings are included within Long-term Debt.\nUnsecured Foreign Facilities\nWe guarantee unsecured revolving and term loan bank facilities used by certain of our Greater China subsidiaries to support their operations (\"Unsecured Foreign Facilities\"). The Unsecured Foreign Facilities have availability totaling $75 million. The interest rates on outstanding borrowings are based upon the applicable benchmark rate for each borrowing. During 2019, we borrowed $50 million and made payments of $59 million under the Unsecured Foreign Facilities. The maximum daily amount outstanding at any point in time in 2019 was $74 million. Borrowings on the Unsecured Foreign Facilities mature between March 2020 and April 2020. As of February 1, 2020, borrowings of $50 million are included within Current Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nCredit Ratings\nOur borrowing costs under our Secured Revolving Facility and Secured Foreign Facilities are linked to our credit ratings. If we receive an upgrade or downgrade to our corporate credit ratings, the borrowing costs could decrease or increase, respectively. The guarantees of our obligations under the Secured Revolving Facility and Secured Foreign Facilities by the Guarantors and the security interests granted in our and the Guarantors' collateral securing such obligations are released if our credit ratings are higher than a certain level. Additionally, the restrictions imposed under the Secured Revolving Facility and Secured Foreign Facilities on our ability to make investments and to make restricted payments cease to apply if our credit ratings are higher than certain levels. Credit rating downgrades by any of the agencies do not accelerate the repayment of any of our debt.\nThe following table provides our credit ratings as of February 1, 2020:\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>S&P\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate\n</td> <td>Ba2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BB-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Unsecured Debt with Subsidiary Guarantee\n</td> <td>Ba2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BB-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Unsecured Debt\n</td> <td>B1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>B\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outlook\n</td> <td>Negative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubsequent to February 1, 2020, Moody's downgraded our Corporate and Senior Unsecured Debt with Subsidiary Guarantee ratings to Ba3, our Senior Unsecured Debt rating to B2 and updated our outlook to Stable. Additionally, S&P downgraded our Corporate and Senior Unsecured Debt with Subsidiary Guarantee ratings to B+, our Senior Unsecured Debt rating to B- and updated our outlook to Negative.\nContingent Liabilities and Contractual Obligations\nThe following table provides our contractual obligations, aggregated by type, including the maturity profile as of February 1, 2020:\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less\nThan 1\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More\nthan 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term Debt (a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Future Lease Obligations (b)\n</td> <td>4,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase Obligations (c)\n</td> <td>1,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Liabilities (d) (e)\n</td> <td>411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Long-term debt obligations relate to our principal and interest payments for outstanding notes and debentures.

The tax liability will be paid over the next five years. For additional information, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLa Senza\nIn connection with the sale of La Senza in the fourth quarter of 2018, certain of our subsidiaries have remaining contingent obligations of $40 million related to lease payments under the current terms of noncancelable leases expiring at various dates through 2028. These obligations include minimum rent and additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain other expenses and relate to leases that commenced prior to the disposition of the business. As part of the sale, a liability of $5 million was recorded for these obligations. During 2019, an additional reserve of $35 million was recorded related to these obligations and certain other items. As of February 1, 2020, reserves of $8 million are included within Accrued Expenses and Other on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the remaining reserves are included within Other Long-term Liabilities.\nOther\nIn connection with noncancelable operating leases of certain assets, we provided residual value guarantees to the lessor if the leased assets cannot be sold for an amount in excess of a specified minimum value at the conclusion of the lease term. The leases expire at various dates through 2021, and the total amount of the guarantees is $94 million. We recorded a liability of $17 million and $11 million related to these guarantee obligations as of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, respectively. This liability is included in Current Operating Lease Liabilities on the February 1, 2020 Consolidated Balance Sheet, and in Other Long-term Liabilities on the February 2, 2019 Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined by Regulation 229.303 Item 303 (a) (4).\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nLeases\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASC 842, Leases, which requires companies classified as lessees to account for most leases on their balance sheet but recognize expense on their income statement in a manner similar to legacy accounting. The standard also requires enhanced quantitative and qualitative disclosures, including significant judgments made by management, to provide greater insight into the extent of expense recognized and expected to be recognized from existing leases. In July 2018, the FASB approved an amendment to the standard that provides companies a modified retrospective transition option that did not require earlier periods to be restated upon adoption.\nWe adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2019 under the modified retrospective approach. As allowed by the new standard, we elected the package of transition practical expedients but elected to not apply the hindsight practical expedient to its leases at transition.\nUpon adoption at the beginning of 2019, we recorded operating lease liabilities of $3.7 billion and operating lease assets for its leases of $3.3 billion. The operating lease assets are net of $470 million of liabilities for deferred rent and unamortized landlord construction allowances that were previously recorded as Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We also recorded a decrease to opening retained earnings, net of tax, of $2 million. The adoption of the standard did not materially impact the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) or Cash Flows.\nHedging Activities\nIn August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which is intended to better align risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships. The standard eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. It also eases certain documentation and assessment requirements. We adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2019. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nGoodwill\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill. The standard eliminates the second step from the goodwill impairment test, which required a hypothetical purchase price allocation to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. Under the new standard, the goodwill impairment charge is the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. We adopted this standard in the third quarter of 2019 and performed our interim and annual goodwill impairment assessments in accordance with ASU 2017-04.\nCredit Losses\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, which requires the use of a forward-looking expected loss impairment model for accounts receivable and certain other financial instruments. This guidance will be effective beginning in fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nImpact of Inflation\nWhile it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on the results of operations and financial condition have been minor.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its accounting policies, estimates and judgments, including those related to inventories, long-lived assets, claims and contingencies, income taxes and revenue recognition. Management bases our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position.\nInventories\nInventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, on a weighted-average cost basis.\nWe record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of inventory on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory. These estimates are based on management's judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience. If actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management, future period merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates.\nWe also record inventory loss adjustments for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory. These estimates are based on management's analysis of historical results and operating trends.\nManagement believes that the assumptions used in these estimates are reasonable and appropriate. A 10% increase or decrease in the inventory valuation adjustment would have impacted net loss by approximately $4 million for 2019. A 10% increase or decrease in the estimated physical inventory loss adjustment would have impacted net loss by approximately $5 million for 2019.\nValuation of Long-lived Assets\nLong-lived Store Assets\nLong-lived store assets, which include leasehold improvements, store related assets and operating lease assets (subsequent to the adoption of ASC 842, Leases), are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Store assets are grouped at the lowest level for which they are largely independent of other assets or asset groups. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset group are less than the carrying value, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value, determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset group. For operating lease assets, we determine the fair value of the assets by comparing the contractual rent payments to estimated market rental rates. An individual asset within an asset group is not impaired below its estimated fair value. The fair value of long-lived store assets are determined using Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy.\nIn 2019 and 2018, we concluded that the negative operating results for certain of our Victoria's Secret stores were an indicator of potential impairment of the related store asset groups. We determined that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows were less than the carrying values and, as a result, determined the estimated fair values of the store asset groups using estimated discounted future cash flows and estimated market rental rates. Accordingly, we recognized a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of an asset group and its estimated fair value but did not impair any individual store asset below its estimated fair value.\nIn 2019, we recognized impairment charges of $198 million for leasehold improvements and store related assets. Impairment charges of $151 million related to stores in Greater China, the U.K. and Ireland, and impairment charges of $47 million related to stores in the U.S. and Canada. For operating lease assets, we recognized impairment charges of $65 million. Impairment charges of $61 million related to stores in Greater China and the U.K., and impairment charges of $4 million related to stores in the U.S.\nIn total, we recognized impairment charges of $263 million for long-lived store assets, which are included in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying & Occupancy in the 2019 Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss). Impairment charges of $212 million, related to store assets in Greater China, the U.K. and Ireland, were recorded within the Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International segment. Impairment charges of $51 million, related to store assets in the U.S. and Canada, were recorded within the Victoria's Secret segment.\nIn 2018, we recognized impairment charges of $101 million for leasehold improvements and store related assets. Impairment charges of $70 million, related to stores in the U.S. and Canada, were recorded within the Victoria's Secret segment. Impairment charges of $31 million, related to stores in the U.K., were recorded within the Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International segment. These charges are included in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying & Occupancy in the 2018 Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss).\nOur fair value estimates incorporated significant assumptions and judgments including, but not limited to, estimated future cash flows, discount rates and market rental rates. The use of different assumptions or judgments in our assessment could materially increase or decrease the fair value of our store assets and, accordingly, could materially increase or decrease any related impairment charge. A three percentage point reduction to our comparable sales assumptions, a key input in determining estimated future cash flows, would not have resulted in a material incremental impairment charge in 2019. Further sustained declines in our business performance could result in a material impairment charge in a future period.\nWhen a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life, depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change. We have the option to either first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that each reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value (including goodwill), or to proceed directly to the quantitative assessment which requires a comparison of the reporting unit's fair value to its carrying value (including goodwill). If we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Our reporting units are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. As a result of goodwill impairment charges recognized in 2019, only the Bath & Body Works reporting unit has goodwill as of February 1, 2020.\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2019, we performed a quantitative interim impairment assessment over the Victoria's Secret and Greater China reporting units. An interim assessment was performed in consideration of the negative performance of these reporting units and their impact on the sustained decline in our market capitalization. Further, for the Greater China reporting unit, we considered the results of the long-lived store asset impairment assessment.\nThe interim assessment concluded that the fair value of the Victoria's Secret reporting unit, which was based on a weighted average of the income and market approaches, exceeded its carrying value. However, the fair value of the Greater China reporting unit, which was based on the income approach, did not exceed its carrying value. Accordingly, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $30 million in the third quarter of 2019 related to the Greater China reporting unit. This charge is included in Impairment of Goodwill in the 2019 Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss).\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment over the Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret reporting units. The fair value of the Bath & Body Works reporting unit was estimated using a weighted average of the income and market approaches. As a result of continued fourth quarter declines in business performance and increased risk, volatility and uncertainty related to the Victoria's Secret reporting unit, we estimated its fair value using a market approach.\nThe annual assessment concluded that the fair value of the Victoria's Secret reporting unit did not exceed its carrying value. Accordingly, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $690 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to the Victoria's Secret reporting unit. This charge is included in Impairment of Goodwill in the 2019 Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss). The annual assessment also concluded that the fair value of the Bath & Body Works reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.\nThe market approach is based on earnings multiples of selected guideline public companies, while the income approach is based on estimated discounted future cash flows. The approaches, which are determined using Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy, incorporated a number of significant assumptions and judgments including, but not limited to, estimated future cash flows, multiples of earnings of similar public companies, discount rates, income tax rates, terminal growth rates and an implied control premium relative to our market capitalization.\nThe use of different assumptions or judgments in our goodwill impairment assessment, including with respect to the estimated future cash flows, the earnings multiples used in the market approach, the discount rate used to discount such estimated future cash flows to their net present value and the reasonableness of the implied control premium relative to our market capitalization, could materially increase or decrease the fair value of our reporting units and, accordingly, could materially increase or decrease any related impairment charge. Declines in our market capitalization or in our business performance could result in a material impairment charge in a future period.\nIntangible Assets - Indefinite Lives\nIntangible assets with indefinite lives represent the Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works trade names. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change. We have the option to either first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, or to proceed directly to the quantitative assessment which requires a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value. To determine if the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount, we will estimate the fair value, usually determined by the relief from royalty method under the income approach, and compare that value with its carrying amount. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference.\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2019, we performed a quantitative interim impairment assessment of the Victoria's Secret trade name. An interim assessment was performed in consideration of the negative performance of Victoria's Secret. To estimate the fair value of the Victoria's Secret trade name, we used the relief from royalty method under the income approach. The interim assessment concluded that the fair value of the Victoria's Secret trade name exceeded its carrying value.\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed our annual impairment assessment of the Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works trade names. To estimate the fair value of the trade names, we used the relief from royalty method under the income approach. The annual assessment concluded that the fair values of the trade names were in excess of their respective carrying values.\nThe use of different assumptions or judgments in our impairment assessment of our trade names, including with respect to the estimated future cash flows, the discount rate used to discount such estimated future cash flows to their net present value and royalty rates used for the relief from royalty method, could materially increase or decrease the fair value of our trade names. A 50% reduction to our assumed royalty rate would not have resulted in a material incremental impairment charge in 2019.\nClaims and Contingencies\nWe are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, insurance, regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business. Our determination of the treatment of claims and contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements is based on management's view of the expected outcome of the applicable claim or contingency. We consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and seek input from both internal and external experts with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. We accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible (as opposed to probable) or if an estimate is not reasonably determinable, disclosure of a material claim or contingency is disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In determining our provision for income taxes, we consider permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates. Our effective income tax rate is affected by items including changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures and the level of earnings.\nWe follow the authoritative guidance included in ASC 740, Income Taxes, which contains a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and for which actual outcomes may differ from forecasted outcomes. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.\nOur income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual, when the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn the first quarter of 2018, we adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, using the modified retrospective approach.\nWe recognize revenue based on the amount we expect to receive when control of the goods or services is transferred to our customer. We recognize sales upon customer receipt of merchandise, which for direct channel revenues reflect an estimate of shipments that have not yet been received by our customer based on shipping terms and historical delivery times. Our shipping and handling revenues are included in Net Sales with the related costs included in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy in our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). We also provide a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on historical experience. Net Sales exclude sales and other similar taxes collected from customers.\nWe offer certain loyalty programs that allow customers to earn points based on purchasing activity. As customers accumulate points and reach point thresholds, they can use the points to purchase merchandise in stores or online. We allocate revenue to points earned on qualifying purchases and defer recognition until the points are redeemed. The amount of revenue deferred is based on the relative stand-alone selling price method, which includes an estimate for points not expected to be redeemed based on historical experience.\nWe sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers. We do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards. We recognize revenue from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer. In addition, we recognize revenue on unredeemed gift cards where the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions (gift card breakage). Gift card breakage revenue is recognized in proportion, and over the same period, as actual gift card redemptions. We determine the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns. Gift card breakage is included in Net Sales in our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).\nRevenue earned in connection with Victoria's Secret's private label credit card arrangement is recognized over the term of the license arrangement and is included in Net Sales in our 2019 and 2018 Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).\nWe also recognize revenues associated with franchise, license, wholesale and sourcing arrangements. Revenue recognized under franchise and license arrangements generally consists of royalties earned and recognized upon sale of merchandise by franchise and license partners to retail customers. Revenue is generally recognized under wholesale and sourcing arrangements at the time the title passes to the partner.", "item_7_truncated": "In March 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new $250

The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and for which actual outcomes may differ from forecasted outcomes. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

percentage change in comparable sales represents direct and comparable store sales. The percentage change in comparable store sales represents the change in sales at comparable stores only and excludes the change in sales from our direct channels. The change in comparable sales provides an indication of period over period growth (decline). A store is typically included in the calculation of comparable sales when it has been open 12 months or more and it has not had a change in selling square footage of 20% or more. Additionally, stores of a given brand are excluded if total selling square footage for the brand in the mall changes by 20% or more through the opening or closing of a second store. The percentage change in comparable sales is calculated on a comparable calendar period as opposed to a fiscal basis. Therefore, the percentage change in comparable sales for 2019 and 2018 was calculated on a 52-to-52-week basis. Comparable sales attributable to our international stores are calculated on a constant currency basis. \nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average daily borrowings (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average borrowing rate (in percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASC 842, Leases, which requires companies classified as lessees to account for most leases on their balance sheet but recognize expense on their income statement in a manner similar to legacy accounting. The standard also requires enhanced quantitative and qualitative disclosures, including significant judgments made by management, to provide greater insight into the extent of expense recognized and expected to be recognized from existing leases. In July 2018, the FASB approved an amendment to the standard that provides companies a modified retrospective transition option that did not require earlier periods to be restated upon adoption.\n\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>S&P\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate\n</td> <td>Ba2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BB-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Unsecured Debt with Subsidiary Guarantee\n</td> <td>Ba2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BB-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Unsecured Debt\n</td> <td>B1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>B\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outlook\n</td> <td>Negative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.\n (b) Includes company-owned stores in the U.K., Ireland and Greater China, direct sales in Greater China and wholesale sales, royalties and other fees associated with non-company owned stores. \nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, our annual goodwill impairment assessment concluded that the carrying value of the Victoria's Secret reporting unit exceeded its fair value. Accordingly, we recognized a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $690 million in the Victoria's Secret segment.\n________________\nITEM 7.

We used the proceeds from the 2029 Notes, together with cash on hand, to fund the purchase price for the tender offers. Additionally, in July 2019, we redeemed the remaining $126 million of outstanding 2020 Notes for $130 million.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, net sales decreased $256 million to $2.276 billion; comparable sales decreased 10%; and comparable store sales decreased 10%. Victoria's Secret Lingerie comparable sales were down in the mid-teens as we continued to pull back promotional activity in bras, and due to merchandise performance in sleepwear. PINK comparable sales were down in the mid-teens driven by declines in apparel, principally in tops, due to merchandise performance. PINK lingerie sales were about flat to last year. Victoria's Secret Beauty comparable sales increased in the low-single digit range due to growth in prestige fragrance, driven by a strong launch of Bombshell Intense, and in PINK beauty and accessories.\nThe following table represents noncompany-owned store data for 2019: \n\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comparable Sales (Stores and Direct) (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Victoria's Secret (b)\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bath & Body Works (b)\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Comparable Sales\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comparable Store Sales (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Victoria's Secret (b)\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bath & Body Works (b)\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Comparable Store Sales\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________\nThe following table provides net sales for 2018 in comparison to 2017:\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average daily borrowings (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average borrowing rate (in percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\n \u2022 Focus on the fundamentals of our business.

Additionally, stores of a given brand are excluded if total selling square footage for the brand in the mall changes by 20% or more through the opening or closing of a second store. The percentage change in comparable sales is calculated on a comparable calendar period as opposed to a fiscal basis. Therefore, the percentage change in comparable sales for 2018 was calculated on a 52-to-52-week basis, and the percentage change in comparable sales for 2017 was calculated on a 53-to-53-week basis. Comparable sales attributable to our international stores are calculated on a constant currency basis.\nLoss on Divestiture of La Senza\n\nThe general, administrative and store operating expense rate decreased to 21.7% from 22.0% driven by the absence of the higher-rate La Senza and Henri Bendel businesses.\n\nOn March 16, 2020, in an abundance of caution and as a proactive measure, we elected to borrow $950 million from our Secured Revolving Facility, leaving our availability under the Secured Revolving Facility at $22 million.\n\nOther Income (Loss)\n (a) The percentage change in comparable sales represents direct and comparable store sales. The percentage change in comparable store sales represents the change in sales at comparable stores only and excludes the change in sales from our direct channels.

A store is typically included in the calculation of comparable sales when it has been open 12 months or more and it has \nFor the fourth quarter of 2018, net sales increased $157 million to $1.951 billion; comparable sales increased 12%; and comparable store sales increased 8%. Net sales increased in most categories including home fragrance, body care and soaps and sanitizers, which incorporated newness, innovation and fashion.\nNet Sales\nThe gross profit (loss) rate decrease was driven by the increase in long-lived store asset impairment charges.\nNet cash used for financing activities in 2018 was $872 million consisting primarily of quarterly dividend payments totaling $2.40 per share, or $666 million, payments for repurchases of common stock of $198 million and payment of long-term debt related to our exchange of notes of $52 million, partially offset by $63 million of net new borrowings under our foreign facilities.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, the gross profit decrease was primarily due to $35 million in long-lived store asset impairment charges recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019, which was related to the operating lease asset of a store in Greater China.\nThe increase in comparable sales was driven by increases in store conversion and digital traffic.\nVictoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International\n (a) Long-term debt divided by total capitalization.  Cash Flow\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, net sales decreased $100 million to $79 million due to the sale of La Senza and closure of Henri Bendel in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nVictoria's Secret Beauty had a good year and a solid holiday performance, with positive low-single digit comparable sales and an improvement in the merchandise margin rate.\nCompany Response to Coronavirus\nImpact of Inflation\nFor the fourth quarter of 2018, the gross profit increase was driven by higher merchandise margin dollars related to higher net sales in Greater China and additional stores opened by our partners.\nWe and the Guarantors guarantee and pledge collateral to secure revolving and term loan bank facilities used by certain of our Greater China subsidiaries to support their operations (\"Secured Foreign Facilities\"). The Secured Foreign Facilities have availability totaling $150 million. The interest rates on outstanding borrowings are based upon the applicable benchmark rate for each borrowing. During 2019, we borrowed $117 million and made payments of $103 million under the Secured Foreign Facilities. The maximum daily amount outstanding at any point in time in 2019 was $103 million. Borrowings on the Secured Foreign Facilities mature between March 2020 and August 2024. As of February 1, 2020, borrowings of $11 million are included within Current Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the remaining borrowings are included within Long-term Debt.\nNet cash used for financing activities in 2017 was $1.127 billion consisting primarily of quarterly dividend payments totaling $2.40 per share, or $686 million, $540 million to redeem our 2019 Notes, repurchases of common stock of $446 million and tax payments related to share-based awards of $32 million. These were partially offset by the net proceeds of $495 million from the 2028 Notes issuance, $52 million of net new borrowings under our foreign facilities and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $38 million.\nAt the same time, we are aggressively focusing on bringing compelling merchandise assortments, marketing and store and online experiences to our customers. We will look for, and seek to capitalize on, those opportunities available to us.\nThe increase in comparable store sales was driven by higher average dollar sales and conversion.\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment over the Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret reporting units. The fair value of the Bath & Body Works reporting unit was estimated using a weighted average of the income and market approaches. As a result of continued fourth quarter declines in business performance and increased risk, volatility and uncertainty related to the Victoria's Secret reporting unit, we estimated its fair value using a market approach.\nGross Profit\nThe gross profit rate increase was driven by lower promotional activity.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, we adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, using the modified retrospective approach.\nWe offer certain loyalty programs that allow customers to earn points based on purchasing activity. As customers accumulate points and reach point thresholds, they can use the points to purchase merchandise in stores or online. We allocate revenue to points earned on qualifying purchases and defer recognition until the points are redeemed. The amount of revenue deferred is based on the relative stand-alone selling price method, which includes an estimate for points not expected to be redeemed based on historical experience.\nIn connection with noncancelable operating leases of certain assets, we provided residual value guarantees to the lessor if the leased assets cannot be sold for an amount in excess of a specified minimum value at the conclusion of the lease term. The leases expire at various dates through 2021, and the total amount of the guarantees is $94 million. We recorded a liability of $17 million and $11 million related to these guarantee obligations as of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, respectively. This liability is included in Current Operating Lease Liabilities on the February 1, 2020 Consolidated Balance Sheet, and in Other Long-term Liabilities on the February 2, 2019 Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nOther\n \u2022 Selling the La Senza business; and \nOn February 20, 2020, we and Sycamore entered into a definitive agreement that is intended to deliver long-term value to L Brands, Inc. shareholders by positioning Bath & Body Works as a standalone public company and transitioning Victoria's Secret, including business conducted under the Victoria's Secret and PINK brands and certain support functions, into a privately-held entity.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized a pre-tax loss on the sale of La Senza of $99 million related to the recognition of $45 million of accumulated translation adjustments and the transfer of the net working capital and long-lived store assets to the buyer.\nOur Board of Directors will determine share repurchase authorizations giving consideration to our levels of profit and cash flow, capital requirements, current and forecasted liquidity, the restrictions placed upon us by our borrowing arrangements as well as financial and other conditions existing at the time. We use cash flow generated from operating and financing activities to fund our share repurchase programs. The timing and amount of any repurchases will be made at our discretion, taking into account a number of factors, including market conditions.\nFor 2018, our other income (loss) increased $15 million to $5 million of income primarily driven by a $45 million pre-tax loss on extinguishment of the 2019 Notes recognized in 2017, partially offset by fewer distributions received from our Easton investments and the negative impacts of foreign exchange.\nIn 2018, we recognized a pre-tax loss on the sale of La Senza of $99 million related to the recognition of $45 million of accumulated translation adjustments and the transfer of the net working capital and long-lived store assets to the buyer.\n________________\nOn March 17, 2020, we announced the temporary closure of all Bath & Body Works, Victoria's Secret and PINK stores in the United States and Canada through March 29, 2020. Associates will continue to receive pay and benefits through April 4, 2020, which is one week longer than originally announced.\n\nIn August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which is intended to better align risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships. The standard eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. It also eases certain documentation and assessment requirements. We adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2019. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nNet cash used for investing activities in 2019 was $480 million consisting primarily of $458 million of capital expenditures. The capital expenditures included $286 million for opening new stores and remodeling and improving existing stores. Remaining capital expenditures were primarily related to spending on technology and logistics to support our digital businesses and other retail capabilities.\nExchange of Notes\nIn an effort to further strengthen our financial flexibility and efficiently manage through the pandemic, we are proactively taking the following additional actions:\nOther Income (Loss)\nNet Sales\nOperating Income (Loss)\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2017 was $1.406 billion, including net income of $983 million. Net income included depreciation of $571 million, deferred income tax benefit of $108 million, share-based compensation expense of $102 million, loss on extinguishment of debt of $45 million and gains on distributions from Easton investments of $20 million. Other changes in assets and liabilities represent items that had a current period cash flow impact, such as changes in working capital. The most significant item in working capital was a decrease in operating cash flow of $137 million associated with an increase in inventory.\n_______________\nThe following table provides net sales for 2019 in comparison to 2018:\nVictoria's Secret\nThe following table provides our contractual obligations, aggregated by type, including the maturity profile as of February 1, 2020:\nThe following table provides our credit ratings as of February 1, 2020:\nThe gross profit rate decrease was driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increased promotional activity and the long-lived store asset impairment charges.\nCompany-Owned Store Data\nVictoria's Secret\nchannel increased 32%. We ended the year with more than 800 newly remodeled stores, which include the White Barn store design. These stores present a new, compelling store experience for the brand and customers alike, driving sales growth.\n\nSubsequent to February 1, 2020, we announced actions in response to the continued spread of the coronavirus.\nBased on the continued spread of the coronavirus and stay-at-home orders by government officials across the country, we are extending the closure of our stores beyond the initial March 29th date. As the situation continues to evolve rapidly, we are not currently able to predict the timing of store reopenings. However, we are monitoring the situation closely and will provide updates as appropriate. We continue to serve customers through our direct channels.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2018, our interest expense decreased $13 million to $93 million due to a lower average borrowing rate and lower average daily borrowings.\n\nExtend our brand internationally\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWhen a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life, depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life.\nResults of Operations-Fourth Quarter of 2019 Compared to Fourth Quarter of 2018\n (a) The percentage change in comparable sales represents direct and comparable store sales. The percentage change in comparable store sales represents the change in sales at comparable stores only and excludes the change in sales from our direct channels. The change in comparable sales provides an indication of period over period growth (decline). A store is typically included in the calculation of comparable sales when it has been open 12 months or more and it has not had a change in selling square footage of 20% or more. Additionally, stores of a given brand are excluded if total selling square footage for the brand in the mall changes by 20% or more through the opening or closing of a second store. The percentage change in comparable sales are calculated on a comparable calendar period as opposed to a fiscal basis. Therefore, the percentage change in comparable sales for 2019 and 2018 was calculated on a 13-to-13-week basis. Comparable sales attributable to our international stores are calculated on a constant currency basis. \nGeneral, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses\nWe believe that our available short-term and long-term capital resources are sufficient to fund foreseeable requirements.\nAdjusted Financial Information\nWe did not repurchase any shares during 2019.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2018, our gross profit decreased $72 million to $1.968 billion, and our gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) decreased to 40.6% from 42.3% primarily as a result of:\nThe following information summarizes our results of operations for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018.\n (f) In the second quarter of 2019, we redeemed $764 million of outstanding notes maturing between 2020 and 2022, resulting in a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of $40 million (after-tax loss of $30 million). In the fourth quarter of 2017, we redeemed our $500 million 8.50% Senior Unsecured Notes due June 2019 resulting in a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of $45 million (after-tax loss of $29 million). For additional information see Note 13, \"Long-term Debt and Borrowing Facilities\" included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. \nIn 2018, we recognized a pre-tax loss on the sale of La Senza of $99 million related to the recognition of $45 million of accumulated translation adjustments and the loss related to the transfer of the net working capital and long-lived store assets to the buyer.\n (b) Future lease obligations primarily represent minimum payments due under store lease agreements. For additional information, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. \nProvision for Income Taxes\n (d) In the third quarter of 2018, we recognized $20 million ($15 million after-tax) of closure costs related to the closure of the Henri Bendel business. For additional information see Note 5, \"Restructuring Activities\" included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. \nSignificant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In determining our provision for income taxes, we consider permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates. Our effective income tax rate is affected by items including changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures and the level of earnings.\nNoncompany-Owned Store Data\n \u2022 Furloughing most store associates and those who are not currently working to support the online businesses or who cannot work from home, effective April 5, 2020 until further notice. All furloughed associates will continue to receive existing healthcare benefits. As circumstances change, we will make every effort to bring these associates back to work as soon as possible. Furloughed associates will also be able to apply for unemployment benefits, if eligible.  As of March 27, 2020, we currently have more than $2 billion in cash, which includes the $950 million borrowed under the Secured Revolving Facility on March 16, 2020. Our Secured Revolving Facility has certain financial covenants, including a debt to consolidated EBITDA covenant, which may be breached as early as the end of the fiscal quarter ending May 2, 2020. If we were to violate a covenant, our lenders would have the right to accelerate our Secured Revolving Facility indebtedness, demand cash collateral in respect of the letters of credit issued thereunder and terminate the funding commitments available thereunder. While we believe that we would be able to obtain temporary waivers for any such breach of a covenant to prevent an acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness or obtain a replacement credit facility, we cannot conclude with certainty that we would have the ability to obtain necessary waivers or negotiate less restrictive debt covenants with our lenders. We are in active conversations with the lenders under our credit facility to obtain a replacement credit facility that does not contain a debt to consolidated EBITDA financial covenant or a temporary waiver in respect of such financial covenant in our existing Secured Revolving Facility. We believe that our current cash balance, along with the actions taken as outlined above, provides us with sufficient current liquidity.\nVictoria's Secret underperformed in 2019. Reduced traffic resulted in increased promotion that negatively impacted margin rates. Victoria's Secret segment comparable sales declined 7% for the year, and operating income declined to a loss of $616 million, due to a $690 million goodwill impairment charge and sales and margin underperformance.\nGoodwill\nGross Profit\nIn November 2017, we retired 36 million shares of our treasury stock. The retirement resulted in a reduction of $2.036 billion in Treasury Stock, $18 million in the par value of Common Stock, $82 million in Paid-in Capital and $1.936 billion in Retained Earnings.\n\n (c) In the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized a $99 million ($55 million after-tax) loss on the sale of La Senza. For additional information see Note 5, \"Restructuring Activities\" included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. \nCommon Stock Share Repurchases\n________________\nOther\n (a) The February 1, 2020 amount includes Current Operating Lease Liabilities as a result of our adoption of ASC 842, Leases, in the first quarter of 2019. \nOur borrowing costs under our Secured Revolving Facility and Secured Foreign Facilities are linked to our credit ratings. If we receive an upgrade or downgrade to our corporate credit ratings, the borrowing costs could decrease or increase, respectively. The guarantees of our obligations under the Secured Revolving Facility and Secured Foreign Facilities by the Guarantors and the security interests granted in our and the Guarantors' collateral securing such obligations are released if our credit ratings are higher than a certain level. Additionally, the restrictions imposed under the Secured Revolving Facility and Secured Foreign Facilities on our ability to make investments and to make restricted payments cease to apply if our credit ratings are higher than certain levels. Credit rating downgrades by any of the agencies do not accelerate the repayment of any of our debt.\nThe gross profit rate decrease was driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increased promotional activity and the long-lived store asset impairment charges.\nIn November 2018, our Board of Directors reduced our annual ordinary dividend to $1.20 per share from $2.40 per share, beginning with the quarterly dividend paid in March 2019.\n \u2022 Returning value to our shareholders.  The following is a discussion regarding certain of our key business priorities:\nFor 2019, net sales decreased $570 million to $6.805 billion; comparable sales decreased 7%; and comparable store sales decreased 9%. Victoria's Secret Lingerie comparable sales were down in the high-single digit range, primarily due to declines in bras and apparel, driven by merchandise performance. PINK comparable sales were down in the low-double digit range, primarily driven by declines in apparel, principally in tops, due to merchandise performance and the exit of the swim business. Victoria's Secret Beauty comparable sales increased in the low-single digit range, as growth in accessories and PINK beauty were partially offset by a decline in the lip business.\nOur Bath & Body Works direct business, with over $950 million in sales and an operating margin in excess of 20%, grew sales by 32% over last year. We continue to invest in direct channel fulfillment to further accelerate growth.\n________________\nThe following information summarizes our results of operations for 2019 compared to 2018.\nThe decrease in comparable store sales was driven by lower average unit retail and reduced traffic.\nLeases\nWe adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2019 under the modified retrospective approach. As allowed by the new standard, we elected the package of transition practical expedients but elected to not apply the hindsight practical expedient to its leases at transition.\n\nThe annual assessment concluded that the fair value of the Victoria's Secret reporting unit did not exceed its carrying value. Accordingly, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $690 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to the Victoria's Secret reporting unit. This charge is included in Impairment of Goodwill in the 2019 Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss). The annual assessment also concluded that the fair value of the Bath & Body Works reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.\nResults of Operations-2019 Compared to 2018\n \u2022 Reducing our regular dividend.  Further, on February 20, 2020, we announced the sale of 55% of the Victoria's Secret business to Sycamore for proceeds of approximately $525 million. The transaction is designed to best position our brands for long-term success and drive shareholder value, and we believe this transaction will highlight the value and performance of the standalone Bath & Body Works business, enhance management focus and reduce structural complexity.\nThe core assortment of Bath & Body Works is body care, home fragrance products, soaps and sanitizers, which together make up the majority of sales and profits for the business. We see clear opportunities for substantial growth in these categories by focusing on product newness and innovation and expanding into under-penetrated market and price segments. We will continue to invest in the White Barn concept, which continues to yield strong results. In 2020, we plan to increase our square footage at Bath & Body Works North America through the opening of new Bath & Body Works stores, substantially in off-mall locations, and the remodeling of existing stores.\n (c) Purchase obligations primarily include purchase orders for merchandise inventory and other agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions. \nThe following table provides the average daily borrowings and average borrowing rates for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017:\nThe following table provides net sales for the fourth quarter of 2019 in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2018:\nIn June 2018, we completed private offers to exchange $62 million, $220 million and $44 million of outstanding 2020 Notes, 2021 Notes and 2022 Notes, respectively, for $297 million of newly issued 6.694% notes due in January 2027 (\"2027 Notes\") and $52 million in cash consideration, which included a $24 million exchange premium. The exchange was treated as a modification under ASC 470, Debt, and no gain or loss was recognized. The exchange premium is being amortized through the maturity date of January 2027 and is included within Long-term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The obligation to pay principal and interest on the 2027 Notes is jointly and severally guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by the Guarantors.\nBath & Body Works\nLa Senza\nFor 2019, the gross profit decrease was primarily due to the increase in long-lived store asset impairment charges, related to stores in Greater China, the U.K. and Ireland, from $31 million in 2018 to $212 million in 2019.\nFor 2018, our gross profit decreased $60 million to $4.899 billion, and our gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) decreased to 37.0% from 39.3% primarily as a result of:\nThe following table provides a summary of our cash flow activity for the fiscal years ended February 1, 2020, February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018:\nAfter taking into account certain liabilities, Sycamore will purchase a 55% interest in Victoria's Secret for approximately $525 million. We intend to use the proceeds from the transaction, along with approximately $500 million of excess balance sheet cash, to reduce debt. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020, subject to customary closing conditions.\nVictoria's Secret\n________________\nOn February 20, 2020, we announced the sale of 55% of the Victoria's Secret business to Sycamore for proceeds of approximately $525 million. The transaction is the result of a comprehensive review of a broad range of options undertaken by our Board of Directors, with input from outside financial advisors, designed to best position our brands for long-term success and drive shareholder value. We believe this transaction will highlight the value and performance of the standalone Bath & Body Works business, enhance management focus and reduce structural complexity.\nInterest Expense\nWe record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of inventory on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory. These estimates are based on management's judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience. If actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management, future period merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates.\nThe use of different assumptions or judgments in our goodwill impairment assessment, including with respect to the estimated future cash flows, the earnings multiples used in the market approach, the discount rate used to discount such estimated future cash flows to their net present value and the reasonableness of the implied control premium relative to our market capitalization, could materially increase or decrease the fair value of our reporting units and, accordingly, could materially increase or decrease any related impairment charge. Declines in our market capitalization or in our business performance could result in a material impairment charge in a future period.\nInventories\nFor the fourth quarter of 2018, net sales decreased $11 million to $179 million due to declines in La Senza and Henri Bendel as we divested La Senza and closed Henri Bendel in the quarter.\nRevenue Recognition\nFor 2018, our general, administrative and store operating expenses increased $332 million to $3.563 billion driven by the change in presentation for income received from our Victoria's Secret private label credit card arrangement, incremental wage investments, higher selling expenses related to higher sales volumes at Bath & Body Works and new company-owned stores in Greater China.\nOur income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual, when the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.\nFor 2018, the gross profit decrease was driven by lower merchandise margin dollars related to the decrease in net sales, increased promotional activity to drive traffic and clear inventory, $70 million of long-lived store asset impairment charges related to certain stores in the U.S. and Canada and increased distribution and fulfillment expenses related to higher direct channel sales.\n \u2022 Suspending our quarterly cash dividend beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. We remain committed to paying dividends over the long-term and will re-evaluate when appropriate. \n (a) Includes company-owned stores in the U.S. and Canada. \n\nWe also record inventory loss adjustments for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory. These estimates are based on management's analysis of historical results and operating trends.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2018, net sales increased $20 million to $190 million, due to new company-owned Victoria's Secret stores, direct channel growth in Greater China and additional stores opened by our partners. These increases were partially offset by a decline at Victoria's Secret U.K.\nLong-lived Store Assets\nNet cash used for financing activities in 2019 was $666 million consisting primarily of $799 million in payments for the early extinguishment of outstanding notes maturing between 2020 and 2022, quarterly dividend payments of $1.20 per share, or $332 million, and tax payments related to share-based awards of $13 million. These were partially offset by the net proceeds of $486 million from the issuance of the 2029 Notes and $5 million of net new borrowings under our Foreign Facilities.\n (a) In the fourth quarter of 2019, we recognized a $690 million pre-tax goodwill impairment charge ($687 million after-tax) related to the Victoria's Secret segment. In the third quarter of 2019, we recognized a $30 million goodwill impairment charge (no tax impact) related to the Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International segment. For additional information see Note 9, \"Goodwill and Trade Names\" included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. \nUnder the authority of our Board of Directors, we repurchased shares of our common stock under the following repurchase programs during fiscal 2018 and 2017:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nUpon adoption at the beginning of 2019, we recorded operating lease liabilities of $3.7 billion and operating lease assets for its leases of $3.3 billion. The operating lease assets are net of $470 million of liabilities for deferred rent and unamortized landlord construction allowances that were previously recorded as Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We also recorded a decrease to opening retained earnings, net of tax, of $2 million. The adoption of the standard did not materially impact the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) or Cash Flows.\n (b) Includes company-owned stores in the U.S. and Canada.  The results by segment are as follows:\nNet cash used for investing activities in 2018 was $609 million consisting primarily of $629 million of capital expenditures partially offset by a $16 million return of capital from Easton investments. The capital expenditures included $487 million for opening new stores and remodeling and improving existing stores. Remaining capital expenditures were primarily related to spending on technology and infrastructure to support growth.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, our interest expense decreased $1 million to $92 million due to lower average daily borrowings partially offset by a higher average borrowing rate.\nThe gross profit rate decrease was driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increased promotions to drive traffic and clear inventory, combined with buying and occupancy deleverage on lower net sales.\n (b) Includes company-owned stores in the U.S. and Canada.  The results by segment are as follows:\nNet Sales\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nThe following table provides a summary of our working capital position and capitalization as of February 1, 2020, February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018:\n (b) Includes company-owned stores in the U.S. and Canada.  The results by segment are as follows:\nFor 2018, net sales increased $31 million to $626 million primarily due to an increase in wholesale sales to our international partners, partially offset by a decline in La Senza as we divested this business on January 6, 2019.\nFocus on the fundamentals of our business\n (a) The percentage change in comparable sales represents direct and comparable store sales. The percentage change in comparable store sales represents the change in sales at comparable stores only and excludes the change in sales from our direct channels. The change in comparable sales provides an indication of period over period growth (decline). A store is typically included in the calculation of comparable sales when it has been open 12 months or more and it has not had a change in selling square footage of 20% or more. Additionally, stores of a given brand are excluded if total selling square footage for the brand in the mall changes by 20% or more through the opening or closing of a second store. The percentage change in comparable sales are calculated on a comparable calendar period as opposed to a fiscal basis. Therefore, the percentage change in comparable sales for 2018 was calculated on a 13-to-13-week basis, and the percentage change in comparable sales for 2017 was calculated on a 14-to-14-week basis. Comparable sales attributable to our international stores are calculated on a constant currency basis. \nOther\nThe general, administrative and store operating expense rate increased to 22.0% from 21.8% due to the presentation change for income received from our Victoria's Secret private label credit card and incremental wage investments.\nThe general, administrative and store operating expense rate increased to 26.9% from 25.6% due to the presentation change for income received from our Victoria's Secret private label credit card and incremental wage investments.\nThe following table provides net sales for the fourth quarter of 2018 in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2017:\nFor the fourth quarter of 2018, our general, administrative and store operating expenses increased $16 million to $1.069 billion primarily driven by the change in presentation for income received from our Victoria's Secret private label credit card arrangement, incremental wage investments and higher selling expenses related to higher sales volumes at Bath & Body Works, partially offset by lower selling expenses and fashion show costs at Victoria's Secret.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, our general, administrative and store operating expenses decreased $47 million to $1.022 billion due to the elimination of the La Senza and Henri Bendel businesses and lower marketing and store selling expenses at Victoria's Secret, partially offset by higher selling and marketing expenses related to higher sales volume at Bath & Body Works.\nIn the second quarter of 2019, we recognized a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $40 million (after-tax loss of $30 million), which includes redemption fees and the write-off of unamortized issuance costs. This loss is included in Other Income (Loss) in the 2019 Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss).\n________________\nNet cash used for investing activities in 2017 was $698 million consisting primarily of $707 million of capital expenditures and purchase of marketable securities of $10 million, partially offset by a $29 million return of capital from Easton investments. The capital expenditures included $601 million for opening new stores and remodeling and improving existing stores. Remaining capital expenditures were primarily related to spending on technology and infrastructure to support growth.\nClaims and Contingencies\n (b) Includes company-owned stores in the U.K., Ireland and Greater China, direct sales in Greater China and wholesale sales, royalties and other fees associated with non-company owned stores. \nFor the fourth quarter of 2018, our other income (loss) increased $42 million to $4 million of income primarily driven by a $45 million pre-tax loss on extinguishment of the 2019 Notes recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFor 2019, our interest expense decreased $7 million to $378 million due to a lower average daily borrowings.\nFor 2018, net sales increased $103 million to $605 million due to new company-owned Victoria's Secret stores, direct channel growth in Greater China and additional stores opened by our partners.\nHedging Activities\nExecutive Overview\nIn connection with the sale of La Senza in the fourth quarter of 2018, certain of our subsidiaries have remaining contingent obligations of $40 million related to lease payments under the current terms of noncancelable leases expiring at various dates through 2028. These obligations include minimum rent and additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain other expenses and relate to leases that commenced prior to the disposition of the business. As part of the sale, a liability of $5 million was recorded for these obligations. During 2019, an additional reserve of $35 million was recorded related to these obligations and certain other items. As of February 1, 2020, reserves of $8 million are included within Accrued Expenses and Other on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the remaining reserves are included within Other Long-term Liabilities.\nWe utilize the retail calendar for reporting. As such, the results for the fourth quarter of 2018 represent the 13-week period ended February 2, 2019, and the results for the fourth quarter of 2017 represent the 14-week period ended February 3, 2018.\n________________\nThe results by segment are as follows:\n (a) Long-term debt obligations relate to our principal and interest payments for outstanding notes and debentures. Interest payments have been estimated based on the coupon rate for fixed rate obligations. Interest obligations exclude amounts which have been accrued through February 1, 2020. For additional information, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. \nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed our annual impairment assessment of the Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works trade names. To estimate the fair value of the trade names, we used the relief from royalty method under the income approach. The annual assessment concluded that the fair values of the trade names were in excess of their respective carrying values.\n\nIn addition to our results provided in accordance with GAAP above and throughout this Form 10-K, provided below are non-GAAP measurements which present operating income, net income and earnings per share in 2019, 2018 and 2017 on an adjusted basis, which remove certain special items. We believe that these special items are not indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and nature. We use adjusted financial information as key performance measures of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Instead, we believe that the presentation of adjusted financial information provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. Further, our definition of adjusted financial information may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. The table below reconciles the GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures. \n (e) Other liabilities also include future estimated payments associated with unrecognized tax benefits. The Less Than 1 Year\u201d category includes $66 million of these tax items because it is reasonably possible that the amounts could change in the next 12 months due to audit settlements or resolution of uncertainties. The remaining portion totaling $24 million is included in the Other\u201d category as it is not reasonably possible that the amounts could change in the next 12 months. In addition, we have a remaining liability of $41 million related to the deemed repatriation tax on our undistributed foreign earnings resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The tax liability will be paid over the next five years. For additional information, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. \nProvision for Income Taxes\nGeneral, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses\nGrow our business in North America\nLong-lived store assets, which include leasehold improvements, store related assets and operating lease assets (subsequent to the adoption of ASC 842, Leases), are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Store assets are grouped at the lowest level for which they are largely independent of other assets or asset groups. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset group are less than the carrying value, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value, determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset group. For operating lease assets, we determine the fair value of the assets by comparing the contractual rent payments to estimated market rental rates. An individual asset within an asset group is not impaired below its estimated fair value. The fair value of long-lived store assets are determined using Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy.\n________________\nTreasury Stock Retirement\n \u2022 Temporarily reducing base compensation by 20% for senior vice presidents and above. The cash compensation of Chairman and CEO Leslie H. Wexner and other members of the Board of Directors has been suspended. Additionally, we are deferring annual merit increases. \nWe believe there is substantial opportunity for international growth. We have a separate, dedicated team that has taken a methodical, \"test and learn\" approach to expansion. We plan to expand our presence outside of North America by increasing the number of stores operated by our international partners. Our partners opened 43 net new Bath & Body Works stores in 2019, bringing the total in the Middle East, Latin America, Southeast Asia and Europe to 278 stores. Our partners plan to open additional stores in 2020.\n2019 Overview\n (a) Includes sourcing and corporate functions, La Senza and Henri Bendel.  For 2018, operating income decreased $491 million to $1.237 billion, and the operating income rate decreased to 9.3% from 13.7%. The drivers of the operating income results are discussed in the following sections.\n (a) Includes company-owned stores in the U.S. and Canada. \n (b) Letters of credit issued reduce our availability under the Secured Revolving Facility. We had outstanding letters of credit that reduce our availability under the Secured Revolving Facility of $19 million as of February 1, 2020, and $9 million as of February 2, 2019, and February 3, 2018.  The following table provides certain measures of liquidity and capital resources as of February 1, 2020, February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018:\nThe following table provides the average daily borrowings and average borrowing rates for 2019 and 2018:\n\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe following table represents company-owned store data for 2017:\n\nOur Board of Directors will determine future dividends after giving consideration to our levels of profit and cash flow, capital requirements, current and forecasted liquidity, the restrictions placed upon us by our borrowing arrangements as well as financial and other conditions existing at the time. We use cash flow generated from operating and financing activities to fund our dividends and share repurchase programs.\nThe following table compares 2019 comparable sales to 2018:\nincluded in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n \u2022 Closing Henri Bendel; \nOther Income and Expenses\n\n________________\nFor additional information related to our 2019 financial performance, see Results of Operations - 2019 Compared to 2018.\u201d\nOther\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change. We have the option to either first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that each reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value (including goodwill), or to proceed directly to the quantitative assessment which requires a comparison of the reporting unit's fair value to its carrying value (including goodwill). If we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Our reporting units are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. As a result of goodwill impairment charges recognized in 2019, only the Bath & Body Works reporting unit has goodwill as of February 1, 2020.\nLoss on Divestiture of La Senza\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2018, operating income decreased $187 million to $800 million, and the operating income rate decreased to 16.5% from 20.5%. The drivers of the operating income results are discussed in the following sections.\nVictoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International\n (a) Includes sourcing and corporate functions, La Senza and Henri Bendel. \nworld may be adversely affected, including manufacturing and textile production. The situation and preventative or protective actions that governments around the world have taken to contain the spread of the coronavirus have resulted in a period of disruption, including closure of stores where our products are sold, limited store operating hours, reduced customer traffic and consumer spending, labor shortages and delays in manufacturing and shipping of products and raw materials in the U.S., China and other countries. To the extent the impact of the coronavirus continues or worsens, we may have difficulty obtaining the materials necessary for the manufacturing of our products, factories which produce our products may remain closed for sustained periods of time, and industry-wide shipment of products may be negatively impacted. Further, if the impact of the coronavirus continues or worsens, consumer behavior may be altered for an extended period of time which would impact our cash and liquidity and financial condition. The coronavirus and resulting economic disruption has also led to significant volatility in the capital markets and may adversely impact our stock price and ability to access cash. Any one adverse effect of the coronavirus, or a combination of adverse effects, could materially impact our results and financial condition.\nBath & Body Works\nLoss on Divestiture of La Senza\nVictoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International\nThe following table compares 2018 comparable sales to 2017:\n\nInterest Expense\nincluded in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2019, we performed a quantitative interim impairment assessment over the Victoria's Secret and Greater China reporting units. An interim assessment was performed in consideration of the negative performance of these reporting units and their impact on the sustained decline in our market capitalization. Further, for the Greater China reporting unit, we considered the results of the long-lived store asset impairment assessment.\nFor 2018, net sales increased $483 million to $4.631 billion; comparable sales increased 11%; and comparable store sales increased 8%. Net sales increased in most categories including home fragrance, body care and soaps and sanitizers, which incorporated newness, innovation and fashion.\n (c) Includes wholesale revenues from our sourcing function, Henri Bendel and La Senza results prior to January 6, 2019.  The following table provides a reconciliation of net sales for the fourth quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2017:\nFor 2019, the gross profit decrease was primarily driven by lower merchandise margin dollars related to the decrease in net sales, partially offset by a reduction in long-lived store asset impairment charges, from $70 million in 2018 to $51 million in 2019.\nManagement believes that the assumptions used in these estimates are reasonable and appropriate. A 10% increase or decrease in the inventory valuation adjustment would have impacted net loss by approximately $4 million for 2019. A 10% increase or decrease in the estimated physical inventory loss adjustment would have impacted net loss by approximately $5 million for 2019.\nIntangible Assets - Indefinite Lives\n \u2022 Maintaining a strong cash and liquidity position while optimizing our capital structure; and \nThe following table represents company-owned store data for 2019:\nOur operating results are generally impacted by economic changes and, therefore, we monitor the retail environment using, among other things, certain key industry performance indicators including competitor performance and mall traffic data. These can provide insight into consumer spending patterns and shopping behavior in the current retail environment and assist us in assessing our performance as well as the potential impact of industry trends on our future operating results. Additionally, we evaluate a number of key performance indicators including comparable sales, gross profit, operating income and other performance metrics such as sales per average selling square foot and inventory per selling square foot in assessing our performance.\nThe following table represents company-owned store data for 2018:\n (a) Includes sourcing and corporate functions. Results for 2018 also include Henri Bendel and La Senza.  For the fourth quarter of 2019, operating income decreased $718 million to $82 million, and the operating income rate decreased to 1.7% from 16.5%. The drivers of the operating income results are discussed in the following sections.\nFor 2019, net sales decreased $287 million to $339 million primarily due to the sale of La Senza and closure of Henri Bendel in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nWorking Capital and Capitalization\n\nOther Income (Loss)\nOperating Income\nPINK comparable sales declined in the low-double digit range in 2019, and the merchandise margin rate declined significantly. Growth in bras and panties was more than offset by a decline in apparel, particularly in tops.\nThe gross profit rate decrease was driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increases in supply chain and sourcing costs and the sales mix shift into the direct business, which has a lower merchandise margin rate than the stores channel.\nVictoria's Secret\nFor 2019, net sales decreased $5 million to $600 million due to declines in the Victoria's Secret Travel Retail business and the negative impact of foreign currency in Greater China, partially offset by the increase from new company-owned Victoria's Secret stores in Greater China.\nCredit Losses\nDividend Policy and Procedures\nDuring 2019, we borrowed and repaid $12 million under the Secured Revolving Facility. As of February 1, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Secured Revolving Facility.\nValuation of Long-lived Assets\nOutside North America, we opened 59 net new stores in 2019, ending the year with 812 stores. Revenue in our international segment was about flat in 2019 compared to last year, and the operating loss increased by $199 million, primarily driven by store asset and goodwill impairment charges in Greater China.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2018 was $1.377 billion, including net income of $644 million. Net income included depreciation of $590 million, long-lived store asset impairment charges of $101 million, loss on divestiture of La Senza of $99 million, share-based compensation expense of $97 million and deferred income tax benefits of $52 million. Other changes in assets and liabilities represent items that had a current period cash flow impact, such as changes in working capital. The most significant item in working capital was a decrease in operating cash flow of $113 million associated with a decrease in income taxes payable.\n\nOur fair value estimates incorporated significant assumptions and judgments including, but not limited to, estimated future cash flows, discount rates and market rental rates. The use of different assumptions or judgments in our assessment could materially increase or decrease the fair value of our store assets and, accordingly, could materially increase or decrease any related impairment charge. A three percentage point reduction to our comparable sales assumptions, a key input in determining estimated future cash flows, would not have resulted in a material incremental impairment charge in 2019. Further sustained declines in our business performance could result in a material impairment charge in a future period.\nWe guarantee unsecured revolving and term loan bank facilities used by certain of our Greater China subsidiaries to support their operations (\"Unsecured Foreign Facilities\"). The Unsecured Foreign Facilities have availability totaling $75 million. The interest rates on outstanding borrowings are based upon the applicable benchmark rate for each borrowing. During 2019, we borrowed $50 million and made payments of $59 million under the Unsecured Foreign Facilities. The maximum daily amount outstanding at any point in time in 2019 was $74 million. Borrowings on the Unsecured Foreign Facilities mature between March 2020 and April 2020. As of February 1, 2020, borrowings of $50 million are included within Current Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nFor 2019, our gross profit decreased $449 million to $4.450 billion, and our gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) decreased to 34.5% from 37.0% primarily as a result of:\nFor 2019, our effective tax rate was (101.9%) compared to 24.9% in 2018. The 2019 rate varied from our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the Victoria's Secret goodwill impairment charges, which generated minimal tax benefit. The 2018 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the tax effects of the divestiture of the La Senza business.\nWe are closely monitoring the outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus that was first detected in Wuhan, China and has since spread globally. The coronavirus has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a pandemic,\u201d has spread to many countries, including the U.S., and is impacting worldwide economic activity. A public health epidemic, including the coronavirus, poses the risk that we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, and other business partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an unknown period of time. Related industries in the U.S. and across the\nBath & Body Works\nUpon the Closing, which is expected to occur in the second quarter, Leslie H. Wexner will step down as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board to become Chairman Emeritus, remaining as a member of the Board. Andrew Meslow, Chief Executive Officer of Bath & Body Works, will be appointed by the Board as the Chief Executive Officer of L Brands, Inc. and as a director of L Brands, Inc., effective upon the Closing. Sarah E. Nash, a member of the Board, will be appointed as the Chair of the Board effective upon the Closing.\nOver the next several months, we will be reviewing the functional and corporate support required for the standalone Bath & Body Works business, with a view to simplify our existing structure, while recognizing that we will still be supporting the Victoria's Secret businesses through a Transition Services Agreement with various terms for different services, which will minimize near-term dissynergies.\nThe following table compares fourth quarter of 2018 comparable sales to fourth quarter of 2017:\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nVictoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International\nOther Income and Expense\nIn 2019, our goodwill impairment assessments concluded that the carrying values of our Victoria's Secret and Greater China reporting units exceeded their fair values. Accordingly, we recognized pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $690 million and $30 million in the Victoria's Secret and Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International segments, respectively.\nBeginning in 2018, we began making significant changes in our business to focus resources on core categories to enhance performance and accelerate growth. In 2018, these actions included:\nFor 2019, our other income (loss) decreased $66 million to a $61 million loss due to a $40 million pre-tax loss associated with the early extinguishment of $764 million in outstanding notes maturing between 2020 and 2022 and $37 million of charges to increase reserves related to ongoing contingent obligations for the La Senza business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nThe gross profit rate decrease was driven by the long-lived store asset impairment charges and investments in store real estate.\n________________\nWe are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, insurance, regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business. Our determination of the treatment of claims and contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements is based on management's view of the expected outcome of the applicable claim or contingency. We consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and seek input from both internal and external experts with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. We accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible (as opposed to probable) or if an estimate is not reasonably determinable, disclosure of a material claim or contingency is disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nWe sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers. We do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards. We recognize revenue from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer. In addition, we recognize revenue on unredeemed gift cards where the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions (gift card breakage). Gift card breakage revenue is recognized in proportion, and over the same period, as actual gift card redemptions. We determine the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns. Gift card breakage is included in Net Sales in our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).\nOther Income (Loss) and Expense\n________________\nThe following table provides our segment operating income (loss) and operating income (loss) rates (expressed as a percentage of net sales) for 2019 in comparison to 2018:\nFor 2018, the gross profit decrease was primarily driven by $31 million of long-lived store asset impairment charges related to certain Victoria's Secret stores in the U.K. and higher occupancy expenses due to investments in store real estate in Greater\nGeneral, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses\nThe following table compares fourth quarter of 2019 comparable sales to fourth quarter of 2018:\n\nIn Victoria's Secret Lingerie, comparable sales declined in the high-single digit range in 2019, and the merchandise margin rate declined significantly. In the fourth quarter, we continued to pull back on promotional activity in bras, and while sales were down significantly, the merchandise margin rate was up. Sleepwear performance was below our expectations, with sales and merchandise margin rate down significantly to last year.\nThe general, administrative and store operating expense rate remained flat at 26.9% as the absence of the higher-rate La Senza and Henri Bendel businesses and declines in marketing and store selling expenses at Victoria's Secret were offset by deleverage on lower net sales.\nVictoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International\nIn June 2019, we issued $500 million of 7.50% notes due in June 2029 (\"2029 Notes\"). The obligation to pay principal and interest on these notes is jointly and severally guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by certain of our 100% owned subsidiaries (the Guarantors\u201d). The proceeds from the issuance were $486 million, which were net of discounts and issuance costs of $14 million. The discounts and issuance costs are being amortized through the maturity date and are included within Long-term Debt on the February 1, 2020 Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nImpairment of Goodwill\n (g) In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a $92 million tax benefit related to changes in U.S. tax legislation. For additional information see Note 12, \"Income Taxes\" included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  2020 Outlook\nThese recent developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additional information on this risk and other uncertainties and factors, is set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nNet Sales\n (b) Includes company-owned stores in the U.K., Ireland and Greater China, direct sales in Greater China and wholesale sales, royalties and other fees associated with non-company owned stores. \n\nGoodwill\nThe following table compares 2019 company-owned store data to the comparable periods for 2018 and 2017:\nIn 2018, we recognized impairment charges of $101 million for leasehold improvements and store related assets. Impairment charges of $70 million, related to stores in the U.S. and Canada, were recorded within the Victoria's Secret segment. Impairment charges of $31 million, related to stores in the U.K., were recorded within the Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International segment. These charges are included in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying & Occupancy in the 2018 Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss).\nRepurchases of Notes\nFor 2019, the gross profit increase was driven by higher merchandise margin dollars related to the increase in net sales, partially offset by higher occupancy expenses due to higher distribution and fulfillment expenses related to higher direct channel sales and investments in store real estate.\nVictoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International\nFor 2019, our general, administrative and store operating expenses decreased $91 million to $3.472 billion due to the elimination of the La Senza and Henri Bendel businesses and lower marketing and store selling expenses at Victoria's Secret, partially offset by higher selling and marketing expenses related to higher sales volume at Bath & Body Works.\nThe gross profit rate decrease was primarily driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increases in supply chain and sourcing costs and the sales mix shift into the direct business, which has a lower merchandise margin rate than the stores channel.\nLiquidity, or access to cash, is an important factor in determining our financial stability. We are committed to maintaining adequate liquidity. Cash generated from our operating activities provides the primary resources to support current operations, growth initiatives, seasonal funding requirements and capital expenditures. Our cash provided from operations is impacted by our net income (loss) and working capital changes. Our net income (loss) is impacted by, among other things, sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, success of new product introductions, profit margins and income taxes. Historically, sales are higher during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. Generally, our need for working capital peaks during the summer and fall months as inventory builds in anticipation of the holiday period. Our cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were $265 million as of February 1, 2020.\nCredit Ratings\nThe Secured Revolving Facility contains fixed charge coverage and debt to EBITDA financial covenants. We are required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.75 to 1.00 and a consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio not exceeding 4.00 to 1.00 for the most recent four-quarter period. Additionally, the Secured Revolving Facility provides that investments and restricted payments may be made, without limitation on amount, if (a) at the time of and after giving effect to such investment or restricted payment, the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the most recent four-quarter period is less than 3.50 to 1.00 and (b) no default or event of default exists. As of February 1, 2020, we were in compliance with both of our financial covenants, and the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA was less than 3.50 to 1.00.\nOperating Income\n\n________________\n\nThe increase in comparable store sales was driven by higher average dollar sales and conversion.\nWe and the Guarantors guarantee and pledge collateral to secure a revolving credit facility. The Secured Revolving Facility has aggregate availability of $1 billion and allows us and certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to borrow and obtain letters of credit in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, Euros, Hong Kong dollars or British pounds.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, the gross profit decrease was driven primarily by lower merchandise margin dollars related to the decrease in net sales.\nResults of Operations-2018 Compared to 2017\nContingent Liabilities and Contractual Obligations\n (b) Includes company-owned stores in the U.S. and Canada. \n\nWe are committed to returning value to our shareholders. During 2019, we paid $332 million in dividends. We use cash flow generated from operating and financing activities to fund our dividends and share repurchase programs. Since 2000, we have returned approximately $21 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nRevenue earned in connection with Victoria's Secret's private label credit card arrangement is recognized over the term of the license arrangement and is included in Net Sales in our 2019 and 2018 Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).\nOperating Activities\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, our gross profit decreased $174 million to $1.794 billion, and our gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) decreased to 38.1% from 40.6% primarily as a result of:\nThe decrease in comparable store sales was driven by lower average unit retail and reduced traffic.\nIncome Taxes\nOperating Income\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, our effective tax rate declined compared to 24.0% in 2018. The 2019 rate varied from our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the Victoria's Secret goodwill impairment charge, which generated minimal tax benefit. The 2018 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the tax effects of the divestiture of the La Senza business.\nL Brands' overall financial performance in 2019 was below our expectations. Operating income declined as growth at Bath & Body Works was more than offset by declines at Victoria's Secret. Our net sales decreased $323 million to $12.914 billion primarily driven by Victoria's Secret and the sale of La Senza and closure of Henri Bendel in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our operating income decreased $979 million to $258 million, primarily due to Victoria's Secret underperformance, and goodwill and long-lived store asset impairment charges. Our operating income rate decreased to 2.0% from 9.3%.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, net sales decreased $13 million to $177 million, due to declines in the Victoria's Secret U.K. business, partially offset by the increase from new company-owned Victoria's Secret stores in Greater China.\nFor 2018, our effective tax rate decreased to 24.9% from 25.1%. The 2018 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the tax effects of the divestiture of the La Senza business. The 2017 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the benefit related to changes in U.S. tax legislation.\nThe gross profit rate increase was driven by lower promotional activity.\n________________\nFinancing Activities\n\nThe following table represents noncompany-owned store data for 2017:\n (d) Other liabilities primarily include future payments relating to our non-qualified supplemental retirement plan of $280 million in the \"1-3 Years\" category. The definitive agreement between us and Sycamore for the sale to Sycamore of the 55% interest in Victoria's Secret requires that we terminate our non-qualified supplemental retirement plan as of the Closing with respect to participants affected by the sale and for all other participants within six months. On March 11, 2020, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors authorized management to take steps to terminate the plan as to all participants. The timing and specifics of such termination have not yet been determined. Any remaining benefits and obligations under the non-qualified plan are expected to be paid out in full approximately one year following the applicable termination. \nBath & Body Works\n (c) Includes wholesale revenues from our sourcing function, Henri Bendel and La Senza results prior to January 6, 2019.  The following table provides a reconciliation of net sales for 2017 to 2018:\nThe following table provides the average daily borrowings and average borrowing rates for the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018:\nThe gross profit rate decrease was driven by the long-lived store asset impairment charges.\nBath & Body Works\nIn 2019 and 2018, we concluded that the negative operating results for certain of our Victoria's Secret stores were an indicator of potential impairment of the related store asset groups. We determined that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows were less than the carrying values and, as a result, determined the estimated fair values of the store asset groups using estimated discounted future cash flows and estimated market rental rates. Accordingly, we recognized a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of an asset group and its estimated fair value but did not impair any individual store asset below its estimated fair value.\n________________\n\nInventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, on a weighted-average cost basis.\n \u2022 Extend our brand internationally; and \nInterest Expense\nImpairment of Goodwill\nThe decrease in comparable sales was driven by declines in store traffic, average unit retail and digital conversion.\n (c) Includes wholesale revenues from our sourcing function. Results for 2018 also include store and direct sales for Henri Bendel and La Senza. \nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill. The standard eliminates the second step from the goodwill impairment test, which required a hypothetical purchase price allocation to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. Under the new standard, the goodwill impairment charge is the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. We adopted this standard in the third quarter of 2019 and performed our interim and annual goodwill impairment assessments in accordance with ASU 2017-04.\nThe following table provides our segment operating income (loss) and operating income rates (expressed as a percentage of net sales) for 2018 in comparison to 2017:\nThe management team, in conjunction with our Board, will also be evaluating the capital structure and cash priorities for the standalone Bath & Body Works business.\nIntangible assets with indefinite lives represent the Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works trade names. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change. We have the option to either first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, or to proceed directly to the quantitative assessment which requires a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value. To determine if the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount, we will estimate the fair value, usually determined by the relief from royalty method under the income approach, and compare that value with its carrying amount. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference.\nFor 2018, net sales decreased $12 million to $7.375 billion; comparable sales decreased 2%; and comparable store sales decreased 6%. PINK comparable sales decreased in the mid-single digit range, primarily driven by merchandise performance in apparel and the exit of swim. Victoria's Secret Lingerie comparable sales decreased in the low-single digit range, primarily driven by declines in unconstructed and sport bras, due to merchandise performance and category resets, partially offset by increases in sleep and panties. Victoria's Secret Beauty comparable sales increased low-double digits, driven by the merchandise assortment. Additionally, net sales increased as a result of the change in presentation for income received from our Victoria's Secret private label credit card arrangement.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, which requires the use of a forward-looking expected loss impairment model for accounts receivable and certain other financial instruments. This guidance will be effective beginning in fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2018, the gross profit increase was driven by higher merchandise margin dollars related to the increase in net sales and reduced promotional activity, partially offset by higher occupancy expenses due to higher distribution and fulfillment expenses related to higher direct channel sales and investments in store real estate.\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") as codified in the Accounting Standards Codification. The following information should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n (c) Includes wholesale revenues from our sourcing function. Results for 2018 also include store and direct sales for Henri Bendel and La Senza.  The following table provides a reconciliation of net sales for 2018 to 2019:\n_______________\n (e) In the third quarter of 2019, we recognized $37 million of pre-tax charges ($28 million after-tax) to increase reserves related to ongoing contingent obligations for the La Senza business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2018. For additional information see Note 17, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. \n\nIssuance of Notes\nThe following table provides our segment operating income (loss) and operating income rates (expressed as a percentage of net sales) for the fourth quarter of 2018 in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2017:\nBath & Body Works\nVictoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International\nThe following table provides our outstanding debt balance, net of unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts, as of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019:\nThe March 2018 repurchase program had $79 million remaining as of February 1, 2020.\nWe also recognize revenues associated with franchise, license, wholesale and sourcing arrangements. Revenue recognized under franchise and license arrangements generally consists of royalties earned and recognized upon sale of merchandise by franchise and license partners to retail customers. Revenue is generally recognized under wholesale and sourcing arrangements at the time the title passes to the partner.\nFor 2018, our interest expense decreased $21 million to $385 million due to a lower average borrowing rate partially offset by higher average daily borrowings.\nThe market approach is based on earnings multiples of selected guideline public companies, while the income approach is based on estimated discounted future cash flows. The approaches, which are determined using Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy, incorporated a number of significant assumptions and judgments including, but not limited to, estimated future cash flows, multiples of earnings of similar public companies, discount rates, income tax rates, terminal growth rates and an implied control premium relative to our market capitalization.\n (a) Includes company-owned stores in the U.S. and Canada. \nSubsequent to February 1, 2020, Moody's downgraded our Corporate and Senior Unsecured Debt with Subsidiary Guarantee ratings to Ba3, our Senior Unsecured Debt rating to B2 and updated our outlook to Stable. Additionally, S&P downgraded our Corporate and Senior Unsecured Debt with Subsidiary Guarantee ratings to B+, our Senior Unsecured Debt rating to B- and updated our outlook to Negative.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its accounting policies, estimates and judgments, including those related to inventories, long-lived assets, claims and contingencies, income taxes and revenue recognition. Management bases our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position.\nWe are focused on the fundamentals of our business which include knowing our customers, focusing on core merchandise categories, inventory management, speed and agility, managing real estate and store selling and execution. In terms of speed and agility, we are focused on inventory discipline through lead-time reductions and in-season agility to increase sales and reduce promotional activity. In terms of real estate, we will continue to proactively and rigorously review our portfolio, and we will continue to open and close stores when we believe it makes sense to do so. Finally, we continue to optimize our store selling and execution by concentrating on a better store experience and developing, retaining and investing in talented, trained and productive store associates.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2018, net sales decreased $137 million to $2.532 billion; comparable sales decreased 3%; and comparable store sales decreased 7%. PINK comparable sales decreased in the low-double digit range, primarily driven by merchandise performance in apparel. Victoria's Secret Lingerie comparable sales were about flat, primarily driven by declines in intimate apparel, due to merchandise performance and category resets, offset by an increase in sleep. Victoria's Secret Beauty comparable sales increased in the mid-single digit range, driven by the merchandise assortment. Additionally, net sales increased as a result of the change in presentation for income received from our Victoria's Secret private label credit card arrangement.\nThe following table represents noncompany-owned store data for 2018:\nSecured Revolving Facility\n (b) In the fourth quarter of 2019, we recognized a $35 million pre-tax impairment charge ($30 million after-tax) related to Victoria's Secret long-lived store assets. In the third quarter of 2019, we recognized a $218 million pre-tax impairment charge ($200 million after-tax) related to Victoria's Secret long-lived store assets. In the third quarter of 2018, we recognized an $81 million pre-tax impairment charge ($73 million after-tax) related to Victoria's Secret long-lived store assets. For additional information see Note 7, \"Property and Equipment, Net\" included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. \nLoss on Divestiture of La Senza\nIn August 2019, we entered into an amendment and restatement ( Amendment\u201d) of the Secured Revolving Facility. The Amendment maintained the aggregate availability under the Secured Revolving Facility at $1 billion and extended the expiration date from May 2022 to August 2024. We incurred fees related to the Amendment of $5 million, which were capitalized and are recorded in Other Assets on the February 1, 2020 Consolidated Balance Sheet and are being amortized over the remaining term of the Secured Revolving Facility.\n________________\nVictoria's Secret\nVictoria's Secret\nIn 2019, we recognized impairment charges of $198 million for leasehold improvements and store related assets. Impairment charges of $151 million related to stores in Greater China, the U.K. and Ireland, and impairment charges of $47 million related to stores in the U.S. and Canada. For operating lease assets, we recognized impairment charges of $65 million. Impairment charges of $61 million related to stores in Greater China and the U.K., and impairment charges of $4 million related to stores in the U.S.\nFor 2019, net sales increased $539 million to $5.170 billion; comparable sales increased 10%; and comparable store sales increased 5%. Net sales increased in all of our main categories including home fragrance, body care and soaps and sanitizers, which incorporated newness, innovation and fashion.\nInterest Expense\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, the gross profit increase was driven by higher merchandise margin dollars related to the increase in net sales, partially offset by higher occupancy expenses due to higher distribution and fulfillment expenses related to higher direct channel sales and investments in store real estate.\nVictoria's Secret", "item_7_text": "In March 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new $250 million share repurchase program, which included the $23 million remaining under the September 2017 repurchase program.\nThe increase in comparable sales was driven by increases in store conversion and digital traffic.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2018, the gross profit decrease was driven by lower merchandise margin dollars related to the decrease in net sales, increased promotional activity to drive traffic and clear inventory and due to $20 million of long-lived store asset impairment charges related to certain stores in the U.S.\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2019, we performed a quantitative interim impairment assessment of the Victoria's Secret trade name. An interim assessment was performed in consideration of the negative performance of Victoria's Secret. To estimate the fair value of the Victoria's Secret trade name, we used the relief from royalty method under the income approach. The interim assessment concluded that the fair value of the Victoria's Secret trade name exceeded its carrying value.\nThe following table provides the average daily borrowings and average borrowing rates for 2018 and 2017:\nWe utilize the retail calendar for reporting. As such, the results for 2018 represent the 52-week period ended February 2, 2019, and the results for 2017 represent the 53-week period ended February 3, 2018.\nThe decrease in comparable sales was driven by declines in store traffic, average unit retail and digital conversion.\nAt Bath & Body Works, an aligned, experienced leadership team and strong customer response to our merchandise assortments, driven by a close connection to our customer and a fast and agile supply chain, resulted in another record year, on top of a record 2018. In 2019, Bath & Body Works' comparable sales increased 10% and operating income increased 11%. Sales in the digital\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was $1.236 billion, including net loss of $366 million. Net loss included depreciation of $588 million, goodwill impairment charges of $720 million, long-lived store asset impairment charges of $263 million, share-based compensation expense of $87 million, loss on extinguishment of debt of $40 million, La Senza charges of $37 million and deferred income tax benefits of $29 million. Other changes in assets and liabilities represent items that had a current period cash flow impact, such as changes in working capital. The most significant item in working capital was a decrease in operating cash flow of $93 million associated with the decrease in Accounts Payables, Accrued Expenses and Other.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2018, our effective tax rate increased to 24.0% from 21.1%. The 2018 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the tax effects of the divestiture of the La Senza business. The 2017 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the benefit related to changes in U.S. tax legislation.\nWe recognize revenue based on the amount we expect to receive when control of the goods or services is transferred to our customer. We recognize sales upon customer receipt of merchandise, which for direct channel revenues reflect an estimate of shipments that have not yet been received by our customer based on shipping terms and historical delivery times. Our shipping and handling revenues are included in Net Sales with the related costs included in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy in our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). We also provide a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on historical experience. Net Sales exclude sales and other similar taxes collected from customers.\nVictoria's Secret\nChina, partially offset by increased merchandise margin dollars related to higher net sales in Greater China and additional stores opened by our partners.\nGross Profit\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized a pre-tax loss on the sale of La Senza of $99 million related to the recognition of $45 million of accumulated translation adjustments and the transfer of the net working capital and long-lived store assets to the buyer.\nAdditionally, we believe that a private entity structure creates the best environment for a Victoria's Secret turnaround. We believe that Sycamore, which has substantial experience in the retail industry, will bring a new perspective and greater focus to the business. We are pleased that, by retaining a significant ownership stake, our shareholders will have the ability to meaningfully participate in the upside potential of this iconic brand.\nThe gross profit rate decrease was driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increased promotions to drive traffic and clear inventory, combined with buying and occupancy deleverage on lower net sales.\n \u2022 Attracting and retaining top talent; \nFor 2018, the gross profit increase was driven by higher merchandise margin dollars related to the increase in net sales and reduced promotional activity, partially offset by higher occupancy expenses due to higher distribution and fulfillment expenses related to higher direct channel sales and investments in store real estate.\nUnder the authority and declaration of our Board of Directors, we paid the following dividends during fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017: \n(a) Relates to the divestiture of La Senza. For additional information see Note 5, \"Restructuring Activities\"\nWe follow the authoritative guidance included in ASC 740, Income Taxes, which contains a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and for which actual outcomes may differ from forecasted outcomes. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.\nThe following table provides our segment operating income (loss) and operating income (loss) rates (expressed as a percentage of net sales) for the fourth quarter of 2019 in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2018:\nResults of Operations-Fourth Quarter of 2018 Compared to Fourth Quarter of 2017\nOn March 16, 2020, as a proactive measure in response to the continued spread of the coronavirus, we elected to borrow $950 million from the Secured Revolving Facility, leaving our availability under the Secured Revolving Facility at $22 million.\nGross Profit\n (a) Includes company-owned stores in the U.S. and Canada. \n (a) The percentage change in comparable sales represents direct and comparable store sales. The percentage change in comparable store sales represents the change in sales at comparable stores only and excludes the change in sales from our direct channels. The change in comparable sales provides an indication of period over period growth (decline). A store is typically included in the calculation of comparable sales when it has been open 12 months or more and it has not had a change in selling square footage of 20% or more. Additionally, stores of a given brand are excluded if total selling square footage for the brand in the mall changes by 20% or more through the opening or closing of a second store. The percentage change in comparable sales is calculated on a comparable calendar period as opposed to a fiscal basis. Therefore, the percentage change in comparable sales for 2019 and 2018 was calculated on a 52-to-52-week basis. Comparable sales attributable to our international stores are calculated on a constant currency basis. \nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASC 842, Leases, which requires companies classified as lessees to account for most leases on their balance sheet but recognize expense on their income statement in a manner similar to legacy accounting. The standard also requires enhanced quantitative and qualitative disclosures, including significant judgments made by management, to provide greater insight into the extent of expense recognized and expected to be recognized from existing leases. In July 2018, the FASB approved an amendment to the standard that provides companies a modified retrospective transition option that did not require earlier periods to be restated upon adoption.\n\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.\n (b) Includes company-owned stores in the U.K., Ireland and Greater China, direct sales in Greater China and wholesale sales, royalties and other fees associated with non-company owned stores. \nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, our annual goodwill impairment assessment concluded that the carrying value of the Victoria's Secret reporting unit exceeded its fair value. Accordingly, we recognized a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $690 million in the Victoria's Secret segment.\n________________\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nWe have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined by Regulation 229.303 Item 303 (a) (4).\n (b) Includes company-owned stores in the U.K., Ireland and Greater China, direct sales in Greater China and wholesale sales, royalties and other fees associated with non-company owned stores. \nThe interim assessment concluded that the fair value of the Victoria's Secret reporting unit, which was based on a weighted average of the income and market approaches, exceeded its carrying value. However, the fair value of the Greater China reporting unit, which was based on the income approach, did not exceed its carrying value. Accordingly, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $30 million in the third quarter of 2019 related to the Greater China reporting unit. This charge is included in Impairment of Goodwill in the 2019 Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss).\n \u2022 Grow our business in North America; \n\nThe Secured Revolving Facility fees related to committed and unutilized amounts are 0.30% per annum, and the fees related to outstanding letters of credit are 1.75% per annum. In addition, the interest rate on outstanding U.S. dollar borrowings is the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") plus 1.75% per annum. The interest rate on outstanding foreign denominated borrowings is the applicable benchmark rate plus 1.75% per annum.\nUnsecured Foreign Facilities\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, net sales increased $224 million to $2.175 billion; comparable sales increased 10%; and comparable store sales increased 5%. Net sales increased in all of our main categories including home fragrance, body care and soaps and sanitizers, which incorporated newness, innovation and fashion.\nWe have a multi-year goal to grow Bath & Body Works and increase operating margins by focusing on these key business priorities:\nSecured Foreign Facilities\nWhile it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on the results of operations and financial condition have been minor.\nBath & Body Works\nThe use of different assumptions or judgments in our impairment assessment of our trade names, including with respect to the estimated future cash flows, the discount rate used to discount such estimated future cash flows to their net present value and royalty rates used for the relief from royalty method, could materially increase or decrease the fair value of our trade names. A 50% reduction to our assumed royalty rate would not have resulted in a material incremental impairment charge in 2019.\nThe Secured Revolving Facility supports our letter of credit program. We had $19 million of outstanding letters of credit as of February 1, 2020 that reduced our availability under the Secured Revolving Facility.\nVictoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International\nGeneral, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses\n (a) Includes sourcing and corporate functions. Results for 2018 also include Henri Bendel and La Senza.  For 2019, operating income decreased $979 million to $258 million, and the operating income rate decreased to 2.0% from 9.3%. The drivers of the operating income results are discussed in the following sections.\n(a) Relates to the divestiture of La Senza. For additional information see Note 5, \"Restructuring Activities\"\n \u2022 Executing a substantial reduction in expenses and capital expenditures. This includes an ongoing reduction in forward inventory receipts. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIn total, we recognized impairment charges of $263 million for long-lived store assets, which are included in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying & Occupancy in the 2019 Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss). Impairment charges of $212 million, related to store assets in Greater China, the U.K. and Ireland, were recorded within the Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International segment. Impairment charges of $51 million, related to store assets in the U.S. and Canada, were recorded within the Victoria's Secret segment.\nThe gross profit rate increase was driven by buying and occupancy leverage on higher net sales.\n________________\nBath & Body Works\nSubsequent to February 1, 2020, our Board of Directors declared the first quarter of 2020 ordinary dividend of $0.30 per share.\nThe global retail sector and our business continue to face an uncertain environment and, as a result, we will continue to manage our business thoughtfully, and we will focus on the execution of the retail fundamentals.\n (a) Sales per average selling square foot and sales per average store, which are indicators of store productivity, are calculated based on store sales for the period divided by the average, including the beginning and end of year, of total square footage and store count, respectively. \nOther\nOther Income (Loss) and Expenses\nIn June 2019, we completed the early settlement of tender offers to repurchase $212 million of outstanding 2020 Notes, $330 million of outstanding 2021 Notes and $96 million of outstanding 2022 Notes for $669 million. We used the proceeds from the 2029 Notes, together with cash on hand, to fund the purchase price for the tender offers. Additionally, in July 2019, we redeemed the remaining $126 million of outstanding 2020 Notes for $130 million.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, net sales decreased $256 million to $2.276 billion; comparable sales decreased 10%; and comparable store sales decreased 10%. Victoria's Secret Lingerie comparable sales were down in the mid-teens as we continued to pull back promotional activity in bras, and due to merchandise performance in sleepwear. PINK comparable sales were down in the mid-teens driven by declines in apparel, principally in tops, due to merchandise performance. PINK lingerie sales were about flat to last year. Victoria's Secret Beauty comparable sales increased in the low-single digit range due to growth in prestige fragrance, driven by a strong launch of Bombshell Intense, and in PINK beauty and accessories.\nThe following table represents noncompany-owned store data for 2019: \n\n________________\nThe following table provides net sales for 2018 in comparison to 2017:\n\n \u2022 Focus on the fundamentals of our business.  We also continue to focus on:\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net sales for the fourth quarter of 2019 to the fourth quarter of 2018:\nLong-term Debt and Borrowing Facilities\nnot had a change in selling square footage of 20% or more. Additionally, stores of a given brand are excluded if total selling square footage for the brand in the mall changes by 20% or more through the opening or closing of a second store. The percentage change in comparable sales is calculated on a comparable calendar period as opposed to a fiscal basis. Therefore, the percentage change in comparable sales for 2018 was calculated on a 52-to-52-week basis, and the percentage change in comparable sales for 2017 was calculated on a 53-to-53-week basis. Comparable sales attributable to our international stores are calculated on a constant currency basis.\nLoss on Divestiture of La Senza\n\nThe general, administrative and store operating expense rate decreased to 21.7% from 22.0% driven by the absence of the higher-rate La Senza and Henri Bendel businesses.\n\nOn March 16, 2020, in an abundance of caution and as a proactive measure, we elected to borrow $950 million from our Secured Revolving Facility, leaving our availability under the Secured Revolving Facility at $22 million.\n\nOther Income (Loss)\n (a) The percentage change in comparable sales represents direct and comparable store sales. The percentage change in comparable store sales represents the change in sales at comparable stores only and excludes the change in sales from our direct channels. The change in comparable sales provides an indication of period over period growth (decline). A store is typically included in the calculation of comparable sales when it has been open 12 months or more and it has \nFor the fourth quarter of 2018, net sales increased $157 million to $1.951 billion; comparable sales increased 12%; and comparable store sales increased 8%. Net sales increased in most categories including home fragrance, body care and soaps and sanitizers, which incorporated newness, innovation and fashion.\nNet Sales\nThe gross profit (loss) rate decrease was driven by the increase in long-lived store asset impairment charges.\nNet cash used for financing activities in 2018 was $872 million consisting primarily of quarterly dividend payments totaling $2.40 per share, or $666 million, payments for repurchases of common stock of $198 million and payment of long-term debt related to our exchange of notes of $52 million, partially offset by $63 million of net new borrowings under our foreign facilities.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, the gross profit decrease was primarily due to $35 million in long-lived store asset impairment charges recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019, which was related to the operating lease asset of a store in Greater China.\nThe increase in comparable sales was driven by increases in store conversion and digital traffic.\nVictoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International\n (a) Long-term debt divided by total capitalization.  Cash Flow\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, net sales decreased $100 million to $79 million due to the sale of La Senza and closure of Henri Bendel in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nVictoria's Secret Beauty had a good year and a solid holiday performance, with positive low-single digit comparable sales and an improvement in the merchandise margin rate.\nCompany Response to Coronavirus\nImpact of Inflation\nFor the fourth quarter of 2018, the gross profit increase was driven by higher merchandise margin dollars related to higher net sales in Greater China and additional stores opened by our partners.\nWe and the Guarantors guarantee and pledge collateral to secure revolving and term loan bank facilities used by certain of our Greater China subsidiaries to support their operations (\"Secured Foreign Facilities\"). The Secured Foreign Facilities have availability totaling $150 million. The interest rates on outstanding borrowings are based upon the applicable benchmark rate for each borrowing. During 2019, we borrowed $117 million and made payments of $103 million under the Secured Foreign Facilities. The maximum daily amount outstanding at any point in time in 2019 was $103 million. Borrowings on the Secured Foreign Facilities mature between March 2020 and August 2024. As of February 1, 2020, borrowings of $11 million are included within Current Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the remaining borrowings are included within Long-term Debt.\nNet cash used for financing activities in 2017 was $1.127 billion consisting primarily of quarterly dividend payments totaling $2.40 per share, or $686 million, $540 million to redeem our 2019 Notes, repurchases of common stock of $446 million and tax payments related to share-based awards of $32 million. These were partially offset by the net proceeds of $495 million from the 2028 Notes issuance, $52 million of net new borrowings under our foreign facilities and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $38 million.\nAt the same time, we are aggressively focusing on bringing compelling merchandise assortments, marketing and store and online experiences to our customers. We will look for, and seek to capitalize on, those opportunities available to us.\nThe increase in comparable store sales was driven by higher average dollar sales and conversion.\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment over the Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret reporting units. The fair value of the Bath & Body Works reporting unit was estimated using a weighted average of the income and market approaches. As a result of continued fourth quarter declines in business performance and increased risk, volatility and uncertainty related to the Victoria's Secret reporting unit, we estimated its fair value using a market approach.\nGross Profit\nThe gross profit rate increase was driven by lower promotional activity.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, we adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, using the modified retrospective approach.\nWe offer certain loyalty programs that allow customers to earn points based on purchasing activity. As customers accumulate points and reach point thresholds, they can use the points to purchase merchandise in stores or online. We allocate revenue to points earned on qualifying purchases and defer recognition until the points are redeemed. The amount of revenue deferred is based on the relative stand-alone selling price method, which includes an estimate for points not expected to be redeemed based on historical experience.\nIn connection with noncancelable operating leases of certain assets, we provided residual value guarantees to the lessor if the leased assets cannot be sold for an amount in excess of a specified minimum value at the conclusion of the lease term. The leases expire at various dates through 2021, and the total amount of the guarantees is $94 million. We recorded a liability of $17 million and $11 million related to these guarantee obligations as of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, respectively. This liability is included in Current Operating Lease Liabilities on the February 1, 2020 Consolidated Balance Sheet, and in Other Long-term Liabilities on the February 2, 2019 Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nOther\n \u2022 Selling the La Senza business; and \nOn February 20, 2020, we and Sycamore entered into a definitive agreement that is intended to deliver long-term value to L Brands, Inc. shareholders by positioning Bath & Body Works as a standalone public company and transitioning Victoria's Secret, including business conducted under the Victoria's Secret and PINK brands and certain support functions, into a privately-held entity.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized a pre-tax loss on the sale of La Senza of $99 million related to the recognition of $45 million of accumulated translation adjustments and the transfer of the net working capital and long-lived store assets to the buyer.\nOur Board of Directors will determine share repurchase authorizations giving consideration to our levels of profit and cash flow, capital requirements, current and forecasted liquidity, the restrictions placed upon us by our borrowing arrangements as well as financial and other conditions existing at the time. We use cash flow generated from operating and financing activities to fund our share repurchase programs. The timing and amount of any repurchases will be made at our discretion, taking into account a number of factors, including market conditions.\nFor 2018, our other income (loss) increased $15 million to $5 million of income primarily driven by a $45 million pre-tax loss on extinguishment of the 2019 Notes recognized in 2017, partially offset by fewer distributions received from our Easton investments and the negative impacts of foreign exchange.\nIn 2018, we recognized a pre-tax loss on the sale of La Senza of $99 million related to the recognition of $45 million of accumulated translation adjustments and the transfer of the net working capital and long-lived store assets to the buyer.\n________________\nOn March 17, 2020, we announced the temporary closure of all Bath & Body Works, Victoria's Secret and PINK stores in the United States and Canada through March 29, 2020. Associates will continue to receive pay and benefits through April 4, 2020, which is one week longer than originally announced.\n\nIn August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which is intended to better align risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships. The standard eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. It also eases certain documentation and assessment requirements. We adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2019. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nNet cash used for investing activities in 2019 was $480 million consisting primarily of $458 million of capital expenditures. The capital expenditures included $286 million for opening new stores and remodeling and improving existing stores. Remaining capital expenditures were primarily related to spending on technology and logistics to support our digital businesses and other retail capabilities.\nExchange of Notes\nIn an effort to further strengthen our financial flexibility and efficiently manage through the pandemic, we are proactively taking the following additional actions:\nOther Income (Loss)\nNet Sales\nOperating Income (Loss)\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2017 was $1.406 billion, including net income of $983 million. Net income included depreciation of $571 million, deferred income tax benefit of $108 million, share-based compensation expense of $102 million, loss on extinguishment of debt of $45 million and gains on distributions from Easton investments of $20 million. Other changes in assets and liabilities represent items that had a current period cash flow impact, such as changes in working capital. The most significant item in working capital was a decrease in operating cash flow of $137 million associated with an increase in inventory.\n_______________\nThe following table provides net sales for 2019 in comparison to 2018:\nVictoria's Secret\nThe following table provides our contractual obligations, aggregated by type, including the maturity profile as of February 1, 2020:\nThe following table provides our credit ratings as of February 1, 2020:\nThe gross profit rate decrease was driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increased promotional activity and the long-lived store asset impairment charges.\nCompany-Owned Store Data\nVictoria's Secret\nchannel increased 32%. We ended the year with more than 800 newly remodeled stores, which include the White Barn store design. These stores present a new, compelling store experience for the brand and customers alike, driving sales growth.\n\nSubsequent to February 1, 2020, we announced actions in response to the continued spread of the coronavirus.\nBased on the continued spread of the coronavirus and stay-at-home orders by government officials across the country, we are extending the closure of our stores beyond the initial March 29th date. As the situation continues to evolve rapidly, we are not currently able to predict the timing of store reopenings. However, we are monitoring the situation closely and will provide updates as appropriate. We continue to serve customers through our direct channels.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2018, our interest expense decreased $13 million to $93 million due to a lower average borrowing rate and lower average daily borrowings.\n\nExtend our brand internationally\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWhen a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life, depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life.\nResults of Operations-Fourth Quarter of 2019 Compared to Fourth Quarter of 2018\n (a) The percentage change in comparable sales represents direct and comparable store sales. The percentage change in comparable store sales represents the change in sales at comparable stores only and excludes the change in sales from our direct channels. The change in comparable sales provides an indication of period over period growth (decline). A store is typically included in the calculation of comparable sales when it has been open 12 months or more and it has not had a change in selling square footage of 20% or more. Additionally, stores of a given brand are excluded if total selling square footage for the brand in the mall changes by 20% or more through the opening or closing of a second store. The percentage change in comparable sales are calculated on a comparable calendar period as opposed to a fiscal basis. Therefore, the percentage change in comparable sales for 2019 and 2018 was calculated on a 13-to-13-week basis. Comparable sales attributable to our international stores are calculated on a constant currency basis. \nGeneral, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses\nWe believe that our available short-term and long-term capital resources are sufficient to fund foreseeable requirements.\nAdjusted Financial Information\nWe did not repurchase any shares during 2019.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2018, our gross profit decreased $72 million to $1.968 billion, and our gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) decreased to 40.6% from 42.3% primarily as a result of:\nThe following information summarizes our results of operations for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018.\n (f) In the second quarter of 2019, we redeemed $764 million of outstanding notes maturing between 2020 and 2022, resulting in a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of $40 million (after-tax loss of $30 million). In the fourth quarter of 2017, we redeemed our $500 million 8.50% Senior Unsecured Notes due June 2019 resulting in a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of $45 million (after-tax loss of $29 million). For additional information see Note 13, \"Long-term Debt and Borrowing Facilities\" included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. \nIn 2018, we recognized a pre-tax loss on the sale of La Senza of $99 million related to the recognition of $45 million of accumulated translation adjustments and the loss related to the transfer of the net working capital and long-lived store assets to the buyer.\n (b) Future lease obligations primarily represent minimum payments due under store lease agreements. For additional information, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. \nProvision for Income Taxes\n (d) In the third quarter of 2018, we recognized $20 million ($15 million after-tax) of closure costs related to the closure of the Henri Bendel business. For additional information see Note 5, \"Restructuring Activities\" included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. \nSignificant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In determining our provision for income taxes, we consider permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates. Our effective income tax rate is affected by items including changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures and the level of earnings.\nNoncompany-Owned Store Data\n \u2022 Furloughing most store associates and those who are not currently working to support the online businesses or who cannot work from home, effective April 5, 2020 until further notice. All furloughed associates will continue to receive existing healthcare benefits. As circumstances change, we will make every effort to bring these associates back to work as soon as possible. Furloughed associates will also be able to apply for unemployment benefits, if eligible.  As of March 27, 2020, we currently have more than $2 billion in cash, which includes the $950 million borrowed under the Secured Revolving Facility on March 16, 2020. Our Secured Revolving Facility has certain financial covenants, including a debt to consolidated EBITDA covenant, which may be breached as early as the end of the fiscal quarter ending May 2, 2020. If we were to violate a covenant, our lenders would have the right to accelerate our Secured Revolving Facility indebtedness, demand cash collateral in respect of the letters of credit issued thereunder and terminate the funding commitments available thereunder. While we believe that we would be able to obtain temporary waivers for any such breach of a covenant to prevent an acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness or obtain a replacement credit facility, we cannot conclude with certainty that we would have the ability to obtain necessary waivers or negotiate less restrictive debt covenants with our lenders. We are in active conversations with the lenders under our credit facility to obtain a replacement credit facility that does not contain a debt to consolidated EBITDA financial covenant or a temporary waiver in respect of such financial covenant in our existing Secured Revolving Facility. We believe that our current cash balance, along with the actions taken as outlined above, provides us with sufficient current liquidity.\nVictoria's Secret underperformed in 2019. Reduced traffic resulted in increased promotion that negatively impacted margin rates. Victoria's Secret segment comparable sales declined 7% for the year, and operating income declined to a loss of $616 million, due to a $690 million goodwill impairment charge and sales and margin underperformance.\nGoodwill\nGross Profit\nIn November 2017, we retired 36 million shares of our treasury stock. The retirement resulted in a reduction of $2.036 billion in Treasury Stock, $18 million in the par value of Common Stock, $82 million in Paid-in Capital and $1.936 billion in Retained Earnings.\n\n (c) In the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized a $99 million ($55 million after-tax) loss on the sale of La Senza. For additional information see Note 5, \"Restructuring Activities\" included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. \nCommon Stock Share Repurchases\n________________\nOther\n (a) The February 1, 2020 amount includes Current Operating Lease Liabilities as a result of our adoption of ASC 842, Leases, in the first quarter of 2019. \nOur borrowing costs under our Secured Revolving Facility and Secured Foreign Facilities are linked to our credit ratings. If we receive an upgrade or downgrade to our corporate credit ratings, the borrowing costs could decrease or increase, respectively. The guarantees of our obligations under the Secured Revolving Facility and Secured Foreign Facilities by the Guarantors and the security interests granted in our and the Guarantors' collateral securing such obligations are released if our credit ratings are higher than a certain level. Additionally, the restrictions imposed under the Secured Revolving Facility and Secured Foreign Facilities on our ability to make investments and to make restricted payments cease to apply if our credit ratings are higher than certain levels. Credit rating downgrades by any of the agencies do not accelerate the repayment of any of our debt.\nThe gross profit rate decrease was driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increased promotional activity and the long-lived store asset impairment charges.\nIn November 2018, our Board of Directors reduced our annual ordinary dividend to $1.20 per share from $2.40 per share, beginning with the quarterly dividend paid in March 2019.\n \u2022 Returning value to our shareholders.  The following is a discussion regarding certain of our key business priorities:\nFor 2019, net sales decreased $570 million to $6.805 billion; comparable sales decreased 7%; and comparable store sales decreased 9%. Victoria's Secret Lingerie comparable sales were down in the high-single digit range, primarily due to declines in bras and apparel, driven by merchandise performance. PINK comparable sales were down in the low-double digit range, primarily driven by declines in apparel, principally in tops, due to merchandise performance and the exit of the swim business. Victoria's Secret Beauty comparable sales increased in the low-single digit range, as growth in accessories and PINK beauty were partially offset by a decline in the lip business.\nOur Bath & Body Works direct business, with over $950 million in sales and an operating margin in excess of 20%, grew sales by 32% over last year. We continue to invest in direct channel fulfillment to further accelerate growth.\n________________\nThe following information summarizes our results of operations for 2019 compared to 2018.\nThe decrease in comparable store sales was driven by lower average unit retail and reduced traffic.\nLeases\nWe adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2019 under the modified retrospective approach. As allowed by the new standard, we elected the package of transition practical expedients but elected to not apply the hindsight practical expedient to its leases at transition.\n\nThe annual assessment concluded that the fair value of the Victoria's Secret reporting unit did not exceed its carrying value. Accordingly, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $690 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to the Victoria's Secret reporting unit. This charge is included in Impairment of Goodwill in the 2019 Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss). The annual assessment also concluded that the fair value of the Bath & Body Works reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.\nResults of Operations-2019 Compared to 2018\n \u2022 Reducing our regular dividend.  Further, on February 20, 2020, we announced the sale of 55% of the Victoria's Secret business to Sycamore for proceeds of approximately $525 million. The transaction is designed to best position our brands for long-term success and drive shareholder value, and we believe this transaction will highlight the value and performance of the standalone Bath & Body Works business, enhance management focus and reduce structural complexity.\nThe core assortment of Bath & Body Works is body care, home fragrance products, soaps and sanitizers, which together make up the majority of sales and profits for the business. We see clear opportunities for substantial growth in these categories by focusing on product newness and innovation and expanding into under-penetrated market and price segments. We will continue to invest in the White Barn concept, which continues to yield strong results. In 2020, we plan to increase our square footage at Bath & Body Works North America through the opening of new Bath & Body Works stores, substantially in off-mall locations, and the remodeling of existing stores.\n (c) Purchase obligations primarily include purchase orders for merchandise inventory and other agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions. \nThe following table provides the average daily borrowings and average borrowing rates for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017:\nThe following table provides net sales for the fourth quarter of 2019 in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2018:\nIn June 2018, we completed private offers to exchange $62 million, $220 million and $44 million of outstanding 2020 Notes, 2021 Notes and 2022 Notes, respectively, for $297 million of newly issued 6.694% notes due in January 2027 (\"2027 Notes\") and $52 million in cash consideration, which included a $24 million exchange premium. The exchange was treated as a modification under ASC 470, Debt, and no gain or loss was recognized. The exchange premium is being amortized through the maturity date of January 2027 and is included within Long-term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The obligation to pay principal and interest on the 2027 Notes is jointly and severally guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by the Guarantors.\nBath & Body Works\nLa Senza\nFor 2019, the gross profit decrease was primarily due to the increase in long-lived store asset impairment charges, related to stores in Greater China, the U.K. and Ireland, from $31 million in 2018 to $212 million in 2019.\nFor 2018, our gross profit decreased $60 million to $4.899 billion, and our gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) decreased to 37.0% from 39.3% primarily as a result of:\nThe following table provides a summary of our cash flow activity for the fiscal years ended February 1, 2020, February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018:\nAfter taking into account certain liabilities, Sycamore will purchase a 55% interest in Victoria's Secret for approximately $525 million. We intend to use the proceeds from the transaction, along with approximately $500 million of excess balance sheet cash, to reduce debt. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020, subject to customary closing conditions.\nVictoria's Secret\n________________\nOn February 20, 2020, we announced the sale of 55% of the Victoria's Secret business to Sycamore for proceeds of approximately $525 million. The transaction is the result of a comprehensive review of a broad range of options undertaken by our Board of Directors, with input from outside financial advisors, designed to best position our brands for long-term success and drive shareholder value. We believe this transaction will highlight the value and performance of the standalone Bath & Body Works business, enhance management focus and reduce structural complexity.\nInterest Expense\nWe record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of inventory on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory. These estimates are based on management's judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience. If actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management, future period merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates.\nThe use of different assumptions or judgments in our goodwill impairment assessment, including with respect to the estimated future cash flows, the earnings multiples used in the market approach, the discount rate used to discount such estimated future cash flows to their net present value and the reasonableness of the implied control premium relative to our market capitalization, could materially increase or decrease the fair value of our reporting units and, accordingly, could materially increase or decrease any related impairment charge. Declines in our market capitalization or in our business performance could result in a material impairment charge in a future period.\nInventories\nFor the fourth quarter of 2018, net sales decreased $11 million to $179 million due to declines in La Senza and Henri Bendel as we divested La Senza and closed Henri Bendel in the quarter.\nRevenue Recognition\nFor 2018, our general, administrative and store operating expenses increased $332 million to $3.563 billion driven by the change in presentation for income received from our Victoria's Secret private label credit card arrangement, incremental wage investments, higher selling expenses related to higher sales volumes at Bath & Body Works and new company-owned stores in Greater China.\nOur income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual, when the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.\nFor 2018, the gross profit decrease was driven by lower merchandise margin dollars related to the decrease in net sales, increased promotional activity to drive traffic and clear inventory, $70 million of long-lived store asset impairment charges related to certain stores in the U.S. and Canada and increased distribution and fulfillment expenses related to higher direct channel sales.\n \u2022 Suspending our quarterly cash dividend beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. We remain committed to paying dividends over the long-term and will re-evaluate when appropriate. \n (a) Includes company-owned stores in the U.S. and Canada. \n\nWe also record inventory loss adjustments for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory. These estimates are based on management's analysis of historical results and operating trends.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2018, net sales increased $20 million to $190 million, due to new company-owned Victoria's Secret stores, direct channel growth in Greater China and additional stores opened by our partners. These increases were partially offset by a decline at Victoria's Secret U.K.\nLong-lived Store Assets\nNet cash used for financing activities in 2019 was $666 million consisting primarily of $799 million in payments for the early extinguishment of outstanding notes maturing between 2020 and 2022, quarterly dividend payments of $1.20 per share, or $332 million, and tax payments related to share-based awards of $13 million. These were partially offset by the net proceeds of $486 million from the issuance of the 2029 Notes and $5 million of net new borrowings under our Foreign Facilities.\n (a) In the fourth quarter of 2019, we recognized a $690 million pre-tax goodwill impairment charge ($687 million after-tax) related to the Victoria's Secret segment. In the third quarter of 2019, we recognized a $30 million goodwill impairment charge (no tax impact) related to the Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International segment. For additional information see Note 9, \"Goodwill and Trade Names\" included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. \nUnder the authority of our Board of Directors, we repurchased shares of our common stock under the following repurchase programs during fiscal 2018 and 2017:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nUpon adoption at the beginning of 2019, we recorded operating lease liabilities of $3.7 billion and operating lease assets for its leases of $3.3 billion. The operating lease assets are net of $470 million of liabilities for deferred rent and unamortized landlord construction allowances that were previously recorded as Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We also recorded a decrease to opening retained earnings, net of tax, of $2 million. The adoption of the standard did not materially impact the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) or Cash Flows.\n (b) Includes company-owned stores in the U.S. and Canada.  The results by segment are as follows:\nNet cash used for investing activities in 2018 was $609 million consisting primarily of $629 million of capital expenditures partially offset by a $16 million return of capital from Easton investments. The capital expenditures included $487 million for opening new stores and remodeling and improving existing stores. Remaining capital expenditures were primarily related to spending on technology and infrastructure to support growth.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, our interest expense decreased $1 million to $92 million due to lower average daily borrowings partially offset by a higher average borrowing rate.\nThe gross profit rate decrease was driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increased promotions to drive traffic and clear inventory, combined with buying and occupancy deleverage on lower net sales.\n (b) Includes company-owned stores in the U.S. and Canada.  The results by segment are as follows:\nNet Sales\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nThe following table provides a summary of our working capital position and capitalization as of February 1, 2020, February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018:\n (b) Includes company-owned stores in the U.S. and Canada.  The results by segment are as follows:\nFor 2018, net sales increased $31 million to $626 million primarily due to an increase in wholesale sales to our international partners, partially offset by a decline in La Senza as we divested this business on January 6, 2019.\nFocus on the fundamentals of our business\n (a) The percentage change in comparable sales represents direct and comparable store sales. The percentage change in comparable store sales represents the change in sales at comparable stores only and excludes the change in sales from our direct channels. The change in comparable sales provides an indication of period over period growth (decline). A store is typically included in the calculation of comparable sales when it has been open 12 months or more and it has not had a change in selling square footage of 20% or more. Additionally, stores of a given brand are excluded if total selling square footage for the brand in the mall changes by 20% or more through the opening or closing of a second store. The percentage change in comparable sales are calculated on a comparable calendar period as opposed to a fiscal basis. Therefore, the percentage change in comparable sales for 2018 was calculated on a 13-to-13-week basis, and the percentage change in comparable sales for 2017 was calculated on a 14-to-14-week basis. Comparable sales attributable to our international stores are calculated on a constant currency basis. \nOther\nThe general, administrative and store operating expense rate increased to 22.0% from 21.8% due to the presentation change for income received from our Victoria's Secret private label credit card and incremental wage investments.\nThe general, administrative and store operating expense rate increased to 26.9% from 25.6% due to the presentation change for income received from our Victoria's Secret private label credit card and incremental wage investments.\nThe following table provides net sales for the fourth quarter of 2018 in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2017:\nFor the fourth quarter of 2018, our general, administrative and store operating expenses increased $16 million to $1.069 billion primarily driven by the change in presentation for income received from our Victoria's Secret private label credit card arrangement, incremental wage investments and higher selling expenses related to higher sales volumes at Bath & Body Works, partially offset by lower selling expenses and fashion show costs at Victoria's Secret.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, our general, administrative and store operating expenses decreased $47 million to $1.022 billion due to the elimination of the La Senza and Henri Bendel businesses and lower marketing and store selling expenses at Victoria's Secret, partially offset by higher selling and marketing expenses related to higher sales volume at Bath & Body Works.\nIn the second quarter of 2019, we recognized a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $40 million (after-tax loss of $30 million), which includes redemption fees and the write-off of unamortized issuance costs. This loss is included in Other Income (Loss) in the 2019 Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss).\n________________\nNet cash used for investing activities in 2017 was $698 million consisting primarily of $707 million of capital expenditures and purchase of marketable securities of $10 million, partially offset by a $29 million return of capital from Easton investments. The capital expenditures included $601 million for opening new stores and remodeling and improving existing stores. Remaining capital expenditures were primarily related to spending on technology and infrastructure to support growth.\nClaims and Contingencies\n (b) Includes company-owned stores in the U.K., Ireland and Greater China, direct sales in Greater China and wholesale sales, royalties and other fees associated with non-company owned stores. \nFor the fourth quarter of 2018, our other income (loss) increased $42 million to $4 million of income primarily driven by a $45 million pre-tax loss on extinguishment of the 2019 Notes recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFor 2019, our interest expense decreased $7 million to $378 million due to a lower average daily borrowings.\nFor 2018, net sales increased $103 million to $605 million due to new company-owned Victoria's Secret stores, direct channel growth in Greater China and additional stores opened by our partners.\nHedging Activities\nExecutive Overview\nIn connection with the sale of La Senza in the fourth quarter of 2018, certain of our subsidiaries have remaining contingent obligations of $40 million related to lease payments under the current terms of noncancelable leases expiring at various dates through 2028. These obligations include minimum rent and additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain other expenses and relate to leases that commenced prior to the disposition of the business. As part of the sale, a liability of $5 million was recorded for these obligations. During 2019, an additional reserve of $35 million was recorded related to these obligations and certain other items. As of February 1, 2020, reserves of $8 million are included within Accrued Expenses and Other on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the remaining reserves are included within Other Long-term Liabilities.\nWe utilize the retail calendar for reporting. As such, the results for the fourth quarter of 2018 represent the 13-week period ended February 2, 2019, and the results for the fourth quarter of 2017 represent the 14-week period ended February 3, 2018.\n________________\nThe results by segment are as follows:\n (a) Long-term debt obligations relate to our principal and interest payments for outstanding notes and debentures. Interest payments have been estimated based on the coupon rate for fixed rate obligations. Interest obligations exclude amounts which have been accrued through February 1, 2020. For additional information, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. \nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed our annual impairment assessment of the Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works trade names. To estimate the fair value of the trade names, we used the relief from royalty method under the income approach. The annual assessment concluded that the fair values of the trade names were in excess of their respective carrying values.\n\nIn addition to our results provided in accordance with GAAP above and throughout this Form 10-K, provided below are non-GAAP measurements which present operating income, net income and earnings per share in 2019, 2018 and 2017 on an adjusted basis, which remove certain special items. We believe that these special items are not indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and nature. We use adjusted financial information as key performance measures of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Instead, we believe that the presentation of adjusted financial information provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. Further, our definition of adjusted financial information may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. The table below reconciles the GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures. \n (e) Other liabilities also include future estimated payments associated with unrecognized tax benefits. The Less Than 1 Year\u201d category includes $66 million of these tax items because it is reasonably possible that the amounts could change in the next 12 months due to audit settlements or resolution of uncertainties. The remaining portion totaling $24 million is included in the Other\u201d category as it is not reasonably possible that the amounts could change in the next 12 months. In addition, we have a remaining liability of $41 million related to the deemed repatriation tax on our undistributed foreign earnings resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The tax liability will be paid over the next five years. For additional information, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. \nProvision for Income Taxes\nGeneral, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses\nGrow our business in North America\nLong-lived store assets, which include leasehold improvements, store related assets and operating lease assets (subsequent to the adoption of ASC 842, Leases), are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Store assets are grouped at the lowest level for which they are largely independent of other assets or asset groups. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset group are less than the carrying value, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value, determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset group. For operating lease assets, we determine the fair value of the assets by comparing the contractual rent payments to estimated market rental rates. An individual asset within an asset group is not impaired below its estimated fair value. The fair value of long-lived store assets are determined using Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy.\n________________\nTreasury Stock Retirement\n \u2022 Temporarily reducing base compensation by 20% for senior vice presidents and above. The cash compensation of Chairman and CEO Leslie H. Wexner and other members of the Board of Directors has been suspended. Additionally, we are deferring annual merit increases. \nWe believe there is substantial opportunity for international growth. We have a separate, dedicated team that has taken a methodical, \"test and learn\" approach to expansion. We plan to expand our presence outside of North America by increasing the number of stores operated by our international partners. Our partners opened 43 net new Bath & Body Works stores in 2019, bringing the total in the Middle East, Latin America, Southeast Asia and Europe to 278 stores. Our partners plan to open additional stores in 2020.\n2019 Overview\n (a) Includes sourcing and corporate functions, La Senza and Henri Bendel.  For 2018, operating income decreased $491 million to $1.237 billion, and the operating income rate decreased to 9.3% from 13.7%. The drivers of the operating income results are discussed in the following sections.\n (a) Includes company-owned stores in the U.S. and Canada. \n (b) Letters of credit issued reduce our availability under the Secured Revolving Facility. We had outstanding letters of credit that reduce our availability under the Secured Revolving Facility of $19 million as of February 1, 2020, and $9 million as of February 2, 2019, and February 3, 2018.  The following table provides certain measures of liquidity and capital resources as of February 1, 2020, February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018:\nThe following table provides the average daily borrowings and average borrowing rates for 2019 and 2018:\n\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe following table represents company-owned store data for 2017:\n\nOur Board of Directors will determine future dividends after giving consideration to our levels of profit and cash flow, capital requirements, current and forecasted liquidity, the restrictions placed upon us by our borrowing arrangements as well as financial and other conditions existing at the time. We use cash flow generated from operating and financing activities to fund our dividends and share repurchase programs.\nThe following table compares 2019 comparable sales to 2018:\nincluded in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n \u2022 Closing Henri Bendel; \nOther Income and Expenses\n\n________________\nFor additional information related to our 2019 financial performance, see Results of Operations - 2019 Compared to 2018.\u201d\nOther\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change. We have the option to either first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that each reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value (including goodwill), or to proceed directly to the quantitative assessment which requires a comparison of the reporting unit's fair value to its carrying value (including goodwill). If we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Our reporting units are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. As a result of goodwill impairment charges recognized in 2019, only the Bath & Body Works reporting unit has goodwill as of February 1, 2020.\nLoss on Divestiture of La Senza\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2018, operating income decreased $187 million to $800 million, and the operating income rate decreased to 16.5% from 20.5%. The drivers of the operating income results are discussed in the following sections.\nVictoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International\n (a) Includes sourcing and corporate functions, La Senza and Henri Bendel. \nworld may be adversely affected, including manufacturing and textile production. The situation and preventative or protective actions that governments around the world have taken to contain the spread of the coronavirus have resulted in a period of disruption, including closure of stores where our products are sold, limited store operating hours, reduced customer traffic and consumer spending, labor shortages and delays in manufacturing and shipping of products and raw materials in the U.S., China and other countries. To the extent the impact of the coronavirus continues or worsens, we may have difficulty obtaining the materials necessary for the manufacturing of our products, factories which produce our products may remain closed for sustained periods of time, and industry-wide shipment of products may be negatively impacted. Further, if the impact of the coronavirus continues or worsens, consumer behavior may be altered for an extended period of time which would impact our cash and liquidity and financial condition. The coronavirus and resulting economic disruption has also led to significant volatility in the capital markets and may adversely impact our stock price and ability to access cash. Any one adverse effect of the coronavirus, or a combination of adverse effects, could materially impact our results and financial condition.\nBath & Body Works\nLoss on Divestiture of La Senza\nVictoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International\nThe following table compares 2018 comparable sales to 2017:\n\nInterest Expense\nincluded in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2019, we performed a quantitative interim impairment assessment over the Victoria's Secret and Greater China reporting units. An interim assessment was performed in consideration of the negative performance of these reporting units and their impact on the sustained decline in our market capitalization. Further, for the Greater China reporting unit, we considered the results of the long-lived store asset impairment assessment.\nFor 2018, net sales increased $483 million to $4.631 billion; comparable sales increased 11%; and comparable store sales increased 8%. Net sales increased in most categories including home fragrance, body care and soaps and sanitizers, which incorporated newness, innovation and fashion.\n (c) Includes wholesale revenues from our sourcing function, Henri Bendel and La Senza results prior to January 6, 2019.  The following table provides a reconciliation of net sales for the fourth quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2017:\nFor 2019, the gross profit decrease was primarily driven by lower merchandise margin dollars related to the decrease in net sales, partially offset by a reduction in long-lived store asset impairment charges, from $70 million in 2018 to $51 million in 2019.\nManagement believes that the assumptions used in these estimates are reasonable and appropriate. A 10% increase or decrease in the inventory valuation adjustment would have impacted net loss by approximately $4 million for 2019. A 10% increase or decrease in the estimated physical inventory loss adjustment would have impacted net loss by approximately $5 million for 2019.\nIntangible Assets - Indefinite Lives\n \u2022 Maintaining a strong cash and liquidity position while optimizing our capital structure; and \nThe following table represents company-owned store data for 2019:\nOur operating results are generally impacted by economic changes and, therefore, we monitor the retail environment using, among other things, certain key industry performance indicators including competitor performance and mall traffic data. These can provide insight into consumer spending patterns and shopping behavior in the current retail environment and assist us in assessing our performance as well as the potential impact of industry trends on our future operating results. Additionally, we evaluate a number of key performance indicators including comparable sales, gross profit, operating income and other performance metrics such as sales per average selling square foot and inventory per selling square foot in assessing our performance.\nThe following table represents company-owned store data for 2018:\n (a) Includes sourcing and corporate functions. Results for 2018 also include Henri Bendel and La Senza.  For the fourth quarter of 2019, operating income decreased $718 million to $82 million, and the operating income rate decreased to 1.7% from 16.5%. The drivers of the operating income results are discussed in the following sections.\nFor 2019, net sales decreased $287 million to $339 million primarily due to the sale of La Senza and closure of Henri Bendel in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nWorking Capital and Capitalization\n\nOther Income (Loss)\nOperating Income\nPINK comparable sales declined in the low-double digit range in 2019, and the merchandise margin rate declined significantly. Growth in bras and panties was more than offset by a decline in apparel, particularly in tops.\nThe gross profit rate decrease was driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increases in supply chain and sourcing costs and the sales mix shift into the direct business, which has a lower merchandise margin rate than the stores channel.\nVictoria's Secret\nFor 2019, net sales decreased $5 million to $600 million due to declines in the Victoria's Secret Travel Retail business and the negative impact of foreign currency in Greater China, partially offset by the increase from new company-owned Victoria's Secret stores in Greater China.\nCredit Losses\nDividend Policy and Procedures\nDuring 2019, we borrowed and repaid $12 million under the Secured Revolving Facility. As of February 1, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Secured Revolving Facility.\nValuation of Long-lived Assets\nOutside North America, we opened 59 net new stores in 2019, ending the year with 812 stores. Revenue in our international segment was about flat in 2019 compared to last year, and the operating loss increased by $199 million, primarily driven by store asset and goodwill impairment charges in Greater China.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2018 was $1.377 billion, including net income of $644 million. Net income included depreciation of $590 million, long-lived store asset impairment charges of $101 million, loss on divestiture of La Senza of $99 million, share-based compensation expense of $97 million and deferred income tax benefits of $52 million. Other changes in assets and liabilities represent items that had a current period cash flow impact, such as changes in working capital. The most significant item in working capital was a decrease in operating cash flow of $113 million associated with a decrease in income taxes payable.\n\nOur fair value estimates incorporated significant assumptions and judgments including, but not limited to, estimated future cash flows, discount rates and market rental rates. The use of different assumptions or judgments in our assessment could materially increase or decrease the fair value of our store assets and, accordingly, could materially increase or decrease any related impairment charge. A three percentage point reduction to our comparable sales assumptions, a key input in determining estimated future cash flows, would not have resulted in a material incremental impairment charge in 2019. Further sustained declines in our business performance could result in a material impairment charge in a future period.\nWe guarantee unsecured revolving and term loan bank facilities used by certain of our Greater China subsidiaries to support their operations (\"Unsecured Foreign Facilities\"). The Unsecured Foreign Facilities have availability totaling $75 million. The interest rates on outstanding borrowings are based upon the applicable benchmark rate for each borrowing. During 2019, we borrowed $50 million and made payments of $59 million under the Unsecured Foreign Facilities. The maximum daily amount outstanding at any point in time in 2019 was $74 million. Borrowings on the Unsecured Foreign Facilities mature between March 2020 and April 2020. As of February 1, 2020, borrowings of $50 million are included within Current Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nFor 2019, our gross profit decreased $449 million to $4.450 billion, and our gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) decreased to 34.5% from 37.0% primarily as a result of:\nFor 2019, our effective tax rate was (101.9%) compared to 24.9% in 2018. The 2019 rate varied from our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the Victoria's Secret goodwill impairment charges, which generated minimal tax benefit. The 2018 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the tax effects of the divestiture of the La Senza business.\nWe are closely monitoring the outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus that was first detected in Wuhan, China and has since spread globally. The coronavirus has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a pandemic,\u201d has spread to many countries, including the U.S., and is impacting worldwide economic activity. A public health epidemic, including the coronavirus, poses the risk that we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, and other business partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an unknown period of time. Related industries in the U.S. and across the\nBath & Body Works\nUpon the Closing, which is expected to occur in the second quarter, Leslie H. Wexner will step down as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board to become Chairman Emeritus, remaining as a member of the Board. Andrew Meslow, Chief Executive Officer of Bath & Body Works, will be appointed by the Board as the Chief Executive Officer of L Brands, Inc. and as a director of L Brands, Inc., effective upon the Closing. Sarah E. Nash, a member of the Board, will be appointed as the Chair of the Board effective upon the Closing.\nOver the next several months, we will be reviewing the functional and corporate support required for the standalone Bath & Body Works business, with a view to simplify our existing structure, while recognizing that we will still be supporting the Victoria's Secret businesses through a Transition Services Agreement with various terms for different services, which will minimize near-term dissynergies.\nThe following table compares fourth quarter of 2018 comparable sales to fourth quarter of 2017:\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nVictoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International\nOther Income and Expense\nIn 2019, our goodwill impairment assessments concluded that the carrying values of our Victoria's Secret and Greater China reporting units exceeded their fair values. Accordingly, we recognized pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $690 million and $30 million in the Victoria's Secret and Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International segments, respectively.\nBeginning in 2018, we began making significant changes in our business to focus resources on core categories to enhance performance and accelerate growth. In 2018, these actions included:\nFor 2019, our other income (loss) decreased $66 million to a $61 million loss due to a $40 million pre-tax loss associated with the early extinguishment of $764 million in outstanding notes maturing between 2020 and 2022 and $37 million of charges to increase reserves related to ongoing contingent obligations for the La Senza business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nThe gross profit rate decrease was driven by the long-lived store asset impairment charges and investments in store real estate.\n________________\nWe are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, insurance, regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business. Our determination of the treatment of claims and contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements is based on management's view of the expected outcome of the applicable claim or contingency. We consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and seek input from both internal and external experts with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. We accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible (as opposed to probable) or if an estimate is not reasonably determinable, disclosure of a material claim or contingency is disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nWe sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers. We do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards. We recognize revenue from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer. In addition, we recognize revenue on unredeemed gift cards where the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions (gift card breakage). Gift card breakage revenue is recognized in proportion, and over the same period, as actual gift card redemptions. We determine the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns. Gift card breakage is included in Net Sales in our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).\nOther Income (Loss) and Expense\n________________\nThe following table provides our segment operating income (loss) and operating income (loss) rates (expressed as a percentage of net sales) for 2019 in comparison to 2018:\nFor 2018, the gross profit decrease was primarily driven by $31 million of long-lived store asset impairment charges related to certain Victoria's Secret stores in the U.K. and higher occupancy expenses due to investments in store real estate in Greater\nGeneral, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses\nThe following table compares fourth quarter of 2019 comparable sales to fourth quarter of 2018:\n\nIn Victoria's Secret Lingerie, comparable sales declined in the high-single digit range in 2019, and the merchandise margin rate declined significantly. In the fourth quarter, we continued to pull back on promotional activity in bras, and while sales were down significantly, the merchandise margin rate was up. Sleepwear performance was below our expectations, with sales and merchandise margin rate down significantly to last year.\nThe general, administrative and store operating expense rate remained flat at 26.9% as the absence of the higher-rate La Senza and Henri Bendel businesses and declines in marketing and store selling expenses at Victoria's Secret were offset by deleverage on lower net sales.\nVictoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International\nIn June 2019, we issued $500 million of 7.50% notes due in June 2029 (\"2029 Notes\"). The obligation to pay principal and interest on these notes is jointly and severally guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by certain of our 100% owned subsidiaries (the Guarantors\u201d). The proceeds from the issuance were $486 million, which were net of discounts and issuance costs of $14 million. The discounts and issuance costs are being amortized through the maturity date and are included within Long-term Debt on the February 1, 2020 Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nImpairment of Goodwill\n (g) In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a $92 million tax benefit related to changes in U.S. tax legislation. For additional information see Note 12, \"Income Taxes\" included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  2020 Outlook\nThese recent developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additional information on this risk and other uncertainties and factors, is set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nNet Sales\n (b) Includes company-owned stores in the U.K., Ireland and Greater China, direct sales in Greater China and wholesale sales, royalties and other fees associated with non-company owned stores. \n\nGoodwill\nThe following table compares 2019 company-owned store data to the comparable periods for 2018 and 2017:\nIn 2018, we recognized impairment charges of $101 million for leasehold improvements and store related assets. Impairment charges of $70 million, related to stores in the U.S. and Canada, were recorded within the Victoria's Secret segment. Impairment charges of $31 million, related to stores in the U.K., were recorded within the Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International segment. These charges are included in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying & Occupancy in the 2018 Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss).\nRepurchases of Notes\nFor 2019, the gross profit increase was driven by higher merchandise margin dollars related to the increase in net sales, partially offset by higher occupancy expenses due to higher distribution and fulfillment expenses related to higher direct channel sales and investments in store real estate.\nVictoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International\nFor 2019, our general, administrative and store operating expenses decreased $91 million to $3.472 billion due to the elimination of the La Senza and Henri Bendel businesses and lower marketing and store selling expenses at Victoria's Secret, partially offset by higher selling and marketing expenses related to higher sales volume at Bath & Body Works.\nThe gross profit rate decrease was primarily driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increases in supply chain and sourcing costs and the sales mix shift into the direct business, which has a lower merchandise margin rate than the stores channel.\nLiquidity, or access to cash, is an important factor in determining our financial stability. We are committed to maintaining adequate liquidity. Cash generated from our operating activities provides the primary resources to support current operations, growth initiatives, seasonal funding requirements and capital expenditures. Our cash provided from operations is impacted by our net income (loss) and working capital changes. Our net income (loss) is impacted by, among other things, sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, success of new product introductions, profit margins and income taxes. Historically, sales are higher during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. Generally, our need for working capital peaks during the summer and fall months as inventory builds in anticipation of the holiday period. Our cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were $265 million as of February 1, 2020.\nCredit Ratings\nThe Secured Revolving Facility contains fixed charge coverage and debt to EBITDA financial covenants. We are required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.75 to 1.00 and a consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio not exceeding 4.00 to 1.00 for the most recent four-quarter period. Additionally, the Secured Revolving Facility provides that investments and restricted payments may be made, without limitation on amount, if (a) at the time of and after giving effect to such investment or restricted payment, the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the most recent four-quarter period is less than 3.50 to 1.00 and (b) no default or event of default exists. As of February 1, 2020, we were in compliance with both of our financial covenants, and the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA was less than 3.50 to 1.00.\nOperating Income\n\n________________\n\nThe increase in comparable store sales was driven by higher average dollar sales and conversion.\nWe and the Guarantors guarantee and pledge collateral to secure a revolving credit facility. The Secured Revolving Facility has aggregate availability of $1 billion and allows us and certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to borrow and obtain letters of credit in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, Euros, Hong Kong dollars or British pounds.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, the gross profit decrease was driven primarily by lower merchandise margin dollars related to the decrease in net sales.\nResults of Operations-2018 Compared to 2017\nContingent Liabilities and Contractual Obligations\n (b) Includes company-owned stores in the U.S. and Canada. \n\nWe are committed to returning value to our shareholders. During 2019, we paid $332 million in dividends. We use cash flow generated from operating and financing activities to fund our dividends and share repurchase programs. Since 2000, we have returned approximately $21 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nRevenue earned in connection with Victoria's Secret's private label credit card arrangement is recognized over the term of the license arrangement and is included in Net Sales in our 2019 and 2018 Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).\nOperating Activities\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, our gross profit decreased $174 million to $1.794 billion, and our gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) decreased to 38.1% from 40.6% primarily as a result of:\nThe decrease in comparable store sales was driven by lower average unit retail and reduced traffic.\nIncome Taxes\nOperating Income\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, our effective tax rate declined compared to 24.0% in 2018. The 2019 rate varied from our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the Victoria's Secret goodwill impairment charge, which generated minimal tax benefit. The 2018 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the tax effects of the divestiture of the La Senza business.\nL Brands' overall financial performance in 2019 was below our expectations. Operating income declined as growth at Bath & Body Works was more than offset by declines at Victoria's Secret. Our net sales decreased $323 million to $12.914 billion primarily driven by Victoria's Secret and the sale of La Senza and closure of Henri Bendel in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our operating income decreased $979 million to $258 million, primarily due to Victoria's Secret underperformance, and goodwill and long-lived store asset impairment charges. Our operating income rate decreased to 2.0% from 9.3%.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, net sales decreased $13 million to $177 million, due to declines in the Victoria's Secret U.K. business, partially offset by the increase from new company-owned Victoria's Secret stores in Greater China.\nFor 2018, our effective tax rate decreased to 24.9% from 25.1%. The 2018 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the tax effects of the divestiture of the La Senza business. The 2017 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the benefit related to changes in U.S. tax legislation.\nThe gross profit rate increase was driven by lower promotional activity.\n________________\nFinancing Activities\n\nThe following table represents noncompany-owned store data for 2017:\n (d) Other liabilities primarily include future payments relating to our non-qualified supplemental retirement plan of $280 million in the \"1-3 Years\" category. The definitive agreement between us and Sycamore for the sale to Sycamore of the 55% interest in Victoria's Secret requires that we terminate our non-qualified supplemental retirement plan as of the Closing with respect to participants affected by the sale and for all other participants within six months. On March 11, 2020, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors authorized management to take steps to terminate the plan as to all participants. The timing and specifics of such termination have not yet been determined. Any remaining benefits and obligations under the non-qualified plan are expected to be paid out in full approximately one year following the applicable termination. \nBath & Body Works\n (c) Includes wholesale revenues from our sourcing function, Henri Bendel and La Senza results prior to January 6, 2019.  The following table provides a reconciliation of net sales for 2017 to 2018:\nThe following table provides the average daily borrowings and average borrowing rates for the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018:\nThe gross profit rate decrease was driven by the long-lived store asset impairment charges.\nBath & Body Works\nIn 2019 and 2018, we concluded that the negative operating results for certain of our Victoria's Secret stores were an indicator of potential impairment of the related store asset groups. We determined that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows were less than the carrying values and, as a result, determined the estimated fair values of the store asset groups using estimated discounted future cash flows and estimated market rental rates. Accordingly, we recognized a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of an asset group and its estimated fair value but did not impair any individual store asset below its estimated fair value.\n________________\n\nInventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, on a weighted-average cost basis.\n \u2022 Extend our brand internationally; and \nInterest Expense\nImpairment of Goodwill\nThe decrease in comparable sales was driven by declines in store traffic, average unit retail and digital conversion.\n (c) Includes wholesale revenues from our sourcing function. Results for 2018 also include store and direct sales for Henri Bendel and La Senza. \nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill. The standard eliminates the second step from the goodwill impairment test, which required a hypothetical purchase price allocation to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. Under the new standard, the goodwill impairment charge is the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. We adopted this standard in the third quarter of 2019 and performed our interim and annual goodwill impairment assessments in accordance with ASU 2017-04.\nThe following table provides our segment operating income (loss) and operating income rates (expressed as a percentage of net sales) for 2018 in comparison to 2017:\nThe management team, in conjunction with our Board, will also be evaluating the capital structure and cash priorities for the standalone Bath & Body Works business.\nIntangible assets with indefinite lives represent the Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works trade names. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change. We have the option to either first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, or to proceed directly to the quantitative assessment which requires a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value. To determine if the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount, we will estimate the fair value, usually determined by the relief from royalty method under the income approach, and compare that value with its carrying amount. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference.\nFor 2018, net sales decreased $12 million to $7.375 billion; comparable sales decreased 2%; and comparable store sales decreased 6%. PINK comparable sales decreased in the mid-single digit range, primarily driven by merchandise performance in apparel and the exit of swim. Victoria's Secret Lingerie comparable sales decreased in the low-single digit range, primarily driven by declines in unconstructed and sport bras, due to merchandise performance and category resets, partially offset by increases in sleep and panties. Victoria's Secret Beauty comparable sales increased low-double digits, driven by the merchandise assortment. Additionally, net sales increased as a result of the change in presentation for income received from our Victoria's Secret private label credit card arrangement.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, which requires the use of a forward-looking expected loss impairment model for accounts receivable and certain other financial instruments. This guidance will be effective beginning in fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2018, the gross profit increase was driven by higher merchandise margin dollars related to the increase in net sales and reduced promotional activity, partially offset by higher occupancy expenses due to higher distribution and fulfillment expenses related to higher direct channel sales and investments in store real estate.\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") as codified in the Accounting Standards Codification. The following information should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n (c) Includes wholesale revenues from our sourcing function. Results for 2018 also include store and direct sales for Henri Bendel and La Senza.  The following table provides a reconciliation of net sales for 2018 to 2019:\n_______________\n (e) In the third quarter of 2019, we recognized $37 million of pre-tax charges ($28 million after-tax) to increase reserves related to ongoing contingent obligations for the La Senza business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2018. For additional information see Note 17, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. \n\nIssuance of Notes\nThe following table provides our segment operating income (loss) and operating income rates (expressed as a percentage of net sales) for the fourth quarter of 2018 in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2017:\nBath & Body Works\nVictoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International\nThe following table provides our outstanding debt balance, net of unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts, as of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019:\nThe March 2018 repurchase program had $79 million remaining as of February 1, 2020.\nWe also recognize revenues associated with franchise, license, wholesale and sourcing arrangements. Revenue recognized under franchise and license arrangements generally consists of royalties earned and recognized upon sale of merchandise by franchise and license partners to retail customers. Revenue is generally recognized under wholesale and sourcing arrangements at the time the title passes to the partner.\nFor 2018, our interest expense decreased $21 million to $385 million due to a lower average borrowing rate partially offset by higher average daily borrowings.\nThe market approach is based on earnings multiples of selected guideline public companies, while the income approach is based on estimated discounted future cash flows. The approaches, which are determined using Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy, incorporated a number of significant assumptions and judgments including, but not limited to, estimated future cash flows, multiples of earnings of similar public companies, discount rates, income tax rates, terminal growth rates and an implied control premium relative to our market capitalization.\n (a) Includes company-owned stores in the U.S. and Canada. \nSubsequent to February 1, 2020, Moody's downgraded our Corporate and Senior Unsecured Debt with Subsidiary Guarantee ratings to Ba3, our Senior Unsecured Debt rating to B2 and updated our outlook to Stable. Additionally, S&P downgraded our Corporate and Senior Unsecured Debt with Subsidiary Guarantee ratings to B+, our Senior Unsecured Debt rating to B- and updated our outlook to Negative.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its accounting policies, estimates and judgments, including those related to inventories, long-lived assets, claims and contingencies, income taxes and revenue recognition. Management bases our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position.\nWe are focused on the fundamentals of our business which include knowing our customers, focusing on core merchandise categories, inventory management, speed and agility, managing real estate and store selling and execution. In terms of speed and agility, we are focused on inventory discipline through lead-time reductions and in-season agility to increase sales and reduce promotional activity. In terms of real estate, we will continue to proactively and rigorously review our portfolio, and we will continue to open and close stores when we believe it makes sense to do so. Finally, we continue to optimize our store selling and execution by concentrating on a better store experience and developing, retaining and investing in talented, trained and productive store associates.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2018, net sales decreased $137 million to $2.532 billion; comparable sales decreased 3%; and comparable store sales decreased 7%. PINK comparable sales decreased in the low-double digit range, primarily driven by merchandise performance in apparel. Victoria's Secret Lingerie comparable sales were about flat, primarily driven by declines in intimate apparel, due to merchandise performance and category resets, offset by an increase in sleep. Victoria's Secret Beauty comparable sales increased in the mid-single digit range, driven by the merchandise assortment. Additionally, net sales increased as a result of the change in presentation for income received from our Victoria's Secret private label credit card arrangement.\nThe following table represents noncompany-owned store data for 2018:\nSecured Revolving Facility\n (b) In the fourth quarter of 2019, we recognized a $35 million pre-tax impairment charge ($30 million after-tax) related to Victoria's Secret long-lived store assets. In the third quarter of 2019, we recognized a $218 million pre-tax impairment charge ($200 million after-tax) related to Victoria's Secret long-lived store assets. In the third quarter of 2018, we recognized an $81 million pre-tax impairment charge ($73 million after-tax) related to Victoria's Secret long-lived store assets. For additional information see Note 7, \"Property and Equipment, Net\" included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. \nLoss on Divestiture of La Senza\nIn August 2019, we entered into an amendment and restatement ( Amendment\u201d) of the Secured Revolving Facility. The Amendment maintained the aggregate availability under the Secured Revolving Facility at $1 billion and extended the expiration date from May 2022 to August 2024. We incurred fees related to the Amendment of $5 million, which were capitalized and are recorded in Other Assets on the February 1, 2020 Consolidated Balance Sheet and are being amortized over the remaining term of the Secured Revolving Facility.\n________________\nVictoria's Secret\nVictoria's Secret\nIn 2019, we recognized impairment charges of $198 million for leasehold improvements and store related assets. Impairment charges of $151 million related to stores in Greater China, the U.K. and Ireland, and impairment charges of $47 million related to stores in the U.S. and Canada. For operating lease assets, we recognized impairment charges of $65 million. Impairment charges of $61 million related to stores in Greater China and the U.K., and impairment charges of $4 million related to stores in the U.S.\nFor 2019, net sales increased $539 million to $5.170 billion; comparable sales increased 10%; and comparable store sales increased 5%. Net sales increased in all of our main categories including home fragrance, body care and soaps and sanitizers, which incorporated newness, innovation and fashion.\nInterest Expense\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, the gross profit increase was driven by higher merchandise margin dollars related to the increase in net sales, partially offset by higher occupancy expenses due to higher distribution and fulfillment expenses related to higher direct channel sales and investments in store real estate.\nVictoria's Secret", "item_7_tables": "Table 120: <table><tr><td> </td>

which included $23 million remaining from a prior program.\n\n- The report provides details on the number of Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works, and other stores operating at the beginning and end of fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, showing store openings, closings, and sales/transfers during those periods. \n\n- Net sales, comparable sales, gross profit, and operating income/loss are shown for the Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works, Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International, and Other segments for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017.\n\n- Several non-recurring special items
