Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion is designed to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles affect our consolidated financial statements. In addition, the following discussion includes certain forward-looking statements. For a discussion of important factors, including the continuing development of our business and other factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results referred to in the forward-looking statements, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" and \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" contained in this Annual Report. Unless otherwise indicated, information in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect continuing operations for all periods presented. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations and Exit Activities to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further information.\nBusiness Overview\nOur Business\nPremier, Inc. (\"Premier\", the \"Company\", \"we\", or \"our\") is a leading healthcare improvement company, uniting an alliance of more than 4,100 U.S. hospitals and health systems and approximately 200,000 other providers and organizations to transform healthcare. We partner with hospitals, health systems, physicians and other healthcare providers with the common goal of improving and innovating in the clinical, financial and operational areas of their businesses to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving healthcare industry. We deliver value through a comprehensive technology-enabled platform that offers critical supply chain services, clinical, financial, operational and value based care software-as-a-service (\"SaaS\") and licensed-based clinical analytics products, consulting services and performance improvement collaborative programs.\nAs of June 30, 2020, we were owned, in part, by 155 U.S. hospitals, health systems and other healthcare organizations, which represented approximately 1,475 owned, leased and managed acute care facilities and other non-acute care organizations, through their ownership of Class B common stock. As of June 30, 2020, the outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock represented 59% and 41%, respectively, of our combined outstanding Class A and Class B common stock. As of June 30, 2020,\nall of our Class B common stock was held beneficially by our member owners and all of our Class A common stock was held by public investors, which may include member owners that have received shares of our Class A common stock in connection with previous quarterly exchanges pursuant to an exchange agreement (the \"Exchange Agreement\") (see Note 1 - Organization and Basis of Presentation to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for more information). On August 11, 2020, we executed a corporate restructuring as described in \"Item 1. Business\" under \"Recent Restructuring\" and in Note 21 - Subsequent Events to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements.\nWe generated net revenue, net income from continuing operations and Adjusted EBITDA (a financial measure not determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"Non-GAAP\")) for the periods presented as follows (in thousands):\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended June 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,299,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,217,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,184,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>291,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>334,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>258,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>564,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>561,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>539,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee \"Our Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Results of Operations\" below for a discussion of our use of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net income from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA.\nOur Business Segments\nOur business model and solutions are designed to provide our members access to scale efficiencies while focusing on optimization of information resources and cost containment, provide actionable intelligence derived from anonymized data in our data warehouse provided by our members, mitigate the risk of innovation and disseminate best practices that will help our member organizations succeed in their transformation to higher quality and more cost-effective healthcare. We deliver our integrated platform of solutions that address the areas of total cost management, quality and safety improvement and value based care through two business segments: Supply Chain Services and Performance Services.\nSegment net revenue was as follows (in thousands):\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Net Revenue\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue:\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Supply Chain Services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>952,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>855,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>823,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance Services\n</td> <td>346,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>362,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>360,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,629\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,299,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,217,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,184,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Supply Chain Services segment includes one of the largest healthcare group purchasing organization programs (\"GPO\") in the United States, serving acute, non-acute, non-healthcare and alternate sites, supply chain co-management and our direct sourcing activities. We generate revenue in our Supply Chain Services segment from administrative fees received from suppliers based on the total dollar volume of supplies purchased by our members, fees from supply chain co-management and through product sales in connection with our direct sourcing activities.\nOur Performance Services segment includes one of the largest informatics and consulting services businesses in the United States focused on healthcare providers. Our software as a service (\"SaaS\") based clinical analytics products and technology licenses utilize our comprehensive data set to provide actionable intelligence to our members, enabling them to benchmark, analyze and identify areas of improvement across three main categories: cost management, quality and safety, and value based care. The Performance Services segment also includes our technology enabled performance improvement collaboratives, consulting services, direct to employer initiative and insurance management services.\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nAcquisition of Health Design Plus, LLC\nOn May 4, 2020, we, through our consolidated subsidiary Premier Healthcare Solutions, Inc. (\"PHSI\"), acquired 97% of the equity of Health Design Plus, LLC (\"HDP\") for an adjusted purchase price of $24.0 million, giving effect to certain purchase price adjustments provided for in the purchase agreement. The transaction was funded with borrowings under our Credit Facility (as defined in Note 10 - Debt to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements). HDP is a third-party administrator and arranges care for employees through its Centers of Excellence program. Shortly after closing, HDP was renamed Contigo Health,\nLLC (\"Contigo Health\") and is reported as part of the Performance Services segment. See Note 3 - Business Acquisitions to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further information.\nAcquisition of Acurity and Nexera Assets\nOn February 28, 2020, we, through two newly formed consolidated subsidiaries, Prince A Purchaser, LLC (\"PAP\") and Prince N Purchaser, LLC (\"PNP\"), acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Acurity, Inc. and Nexera, Inc., both indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Greater New York Hospital Association (\"GNYHA\"), for an aggregate amount of $291.5 million, of which $166.1 million was paid at closing with borrowings under our Credit Facility. Pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement (as amended, the \"Purchase Agreement\"), an additional $120.0 million will be paid to the sellers in four equal annual installments of $30.0 million on or about June 30, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024. An additional $5.4 million is expected to be paid during our first fiscal quarter of 2021. In addition to the aggregate amount of $291.5 million, the Purchase Agreement provides a graduated earn-out opportunity to Acurity, Inc. of up to $30.0 million based upon our achievement of a range of member renewals on terms to be agreed to by us and GNYHA based on prevailing market conditions in December 2023.\nAfter the closing of the transaction, we changed the names of PAP and PNP to Acurity, LLC (\"Acurity\") and Nexera, LLC (\"Nexera\"), respectively. Acurity is a regional group purchasing organization and has been a customer and strategic partner of ours for more than 24 years. Nexera is a hospital financial improvement consulting firm which partners with healthcare organizations to improve hospital and health system performance, with a significant focus on supply chain enhancement and transformation. We report the operations of Acurity and Nexera as part of the Supply Chain Services segment. See Note 3 - Business Acquisitions to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further information.\nAcquisition of Medpricer\nOn October 28, 2019, we, through its consolidated subsidiary, Premier Supply Chain Improvement, Inc. (\"PSCI\"), acquired all of the outstanding capital stock in Medpricer.com, Inc. (\"Medpricer\") for an adjusted purchase price of $38.5 million, giving effect to certain purchase price adjustments provided for in the purchase agreement. The transaction was funded with borrowings under the Credit Facility. Medpricer is a SaaS-based provider of technology solutions that enable hospitals and other organizations to analyze, benchmark and source purchased services contracts independent of any existing GPO affiliation. Recently, Medpricer changed its name to Conductiv, Inc. (\"Conductiv\") and is reported as part of the Supply Chain Services segment. See Note 3 - Business Acquisitions to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further information.\nAcquisition of Stanson\nOn November 9, 2018, we acquired 100% of the outstanding capital stock in Stanson Health, Inc. (\"Stanson\") for an adjusted purchase price of $55.4 million, giving effect to certain purchase price adjustments provided for in the purchase agreement. Stanson is a SaaS-based provider of clinical decision support tools that are integrated directly into the electronic health record workflow, to help provide real-time, patient-specific best practices at the point of care. Stanson is reported as part of the Performance Services segment. See Note 3 - Business Acquisitions to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further information.\nDivestiture of Specialty Pharmacy Business - Discontinued Operations\nOn June 7, 2019, we completed the sale of prescription files and records and certain other assets used in our specialty pharmacy business for $22.3 million. We also received $7.6 million related to the sale of a portion of our pharmaceutical inventory on June 10, 2019, and an additional $3.6 million on July 24, 2019 primarily in connection with the sale of our remaining pharmaceutical inventory. In addition, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, we had substantially completed the wind down and exit from the specialty pharmacy business. We recognized non-cash impairment charges of $80.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2019 related to goodwill, purchased intangibles and other assets of the specialty pharmacy business that were not sold or did not have an alternative use.\nWe met the criteria for classifying certain assets and liabilities of the specialty pharmacy business as a discontinued operation as of June 30, 2019. Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated, information in this Annual Report has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect continuing operations for all periods presented. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations and Exit Activities to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further information.\nMarket and Industry Trends and Outlook\nWe expect that certain trends and economic or industry-wide factors will continue to affect our business, both in the short-term and long-term. We have based our expectations described below on assumptions made by us and on information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about, or interpretation of, available information prove to be incorrect our actual\nresults may vary materially from our expected results. See \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" and \"Risk Factors.\"\nTrends in the U.S. healthcare market affect our revenues and costs in the Supply Chain Services and Performance Services segments. The trends we see affecting our current healthcare business include the impact of the implementation of current or future healthcare legislation, particularly the uncertainty regarding the status of the Affordable Care Act, its repeal, replacement or other modification, the enactment of new regulatory and reporting requirements, expansion and contraction of insurance coverage and associated costs that may impact subscriber elections, intense cost pressure, payment reform, provider consolidation, shift in care to the alternate site market and increased data availability and transparency. To meet the demands of this environment, there will be increased focus on scale and cost containment and healthcare providers will need to measure and report on and bear financial risk for outcomes. Over the long-term, we believe these trends will result in increased demand for our Supply Chain Services and Performance Services solutions in the areas of cost management, quality and safety, and value based care, however, there are uncertainties and risks that may affect the actual impact of these anticipated trends, expected demand for our services or related assumptions on our business. See \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" for more information.\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nIn addition to the trends in the U.S. healthcare market discussed above, we face known and unknown uncertainties arising from the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") and the resulting global pandemic and financial and operational uncertainty, including its impact on the overall economy, our sales, operations and supply chains, our members, workforce and suppliers, and countries. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and potential future pandemic outbreaks, we face significant risks including, but not limited to:\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Changes in the demand for our products and services. We have experienced and may continue to experience demand uncertainty from both significant increases and decreases in demand as a result of COVID-19. There has been a significant increase in demand for personal protective equipment (\"PPE\"), drugs and other supplies directly related to treating and preventing the spread of COVID-19. However, either voluntarily or due to government orders or advisories, patients, hospitals and other medical facilities have deferred elective procedures and routine medical visits during the crisis, which created a significant decline in the demand for supplies and services not related to COVID-19 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and such lower demand is expected to continue into fiscal 2021. In addition, as a result of our members' focus on managing COVID-19 and its impacts, we have experienced a decrease in demand for our consulting and other performance service engagements. Furthermore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our members' non-acute or non-healthcare facilities, such as education and hospitality businesses, closed, operated on a limited or reduced basis and have delayed re-opening, and, as a result, we may see a material reduction in product sales to those facilities. The extent to which these impacts on demand will continue, and the effect that they will have on our business and operating results, will depend upon future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Limited access to our members' facilities that impacts our ability to fulfill our contractual requirements. Our member hospitals and non-acute care sites have experienced reduced or limited access for non-patients, including our field teams, consultants and other professionals, and travel restrictions have impacted our employees' ability to travel to our members' facilities. The long-term continuation, or any future recurrence of these circumstances may negatively impact the ability of our employees to more effectively deliver existing or sell new products and services to our members and could affect our performance of our existing contracts.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Materials and personnel shortages and disruptions in supply chain, including manufacturing and shipping. The global supply chain has been significantly disrupted due to stay at home orders, border closings and rapidly escalating shipping costs. Borders closings and restrictions in response to COVID-19, particularly regarding China and India, have impacted our access to products for our members. Staffing or personnel shortages due to shelter in place orders and quarantines have impacted and in the future may impact us and our members or suppliers. In addition, due to unprecedented demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, there are widespread shortages in certain product categories. In the food service line, COVID-19 related illnesses have impacted food processing suppliers and led to plant closures. If the supply chain for materials used in the products purchased by our members through our GPO or products contract manufactured through our direct sourcing business is adversely impacted by restrictions resulting from COVID-19, our supply chain may be disrupted. Failure of our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors and other business partners to meet their obligations to our members or to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so due to their own financial or operational difficulties, may adversely impact our operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Requests for contract modifications, payment deferrals or exercises of force majeure clauses.

In addition, we may receive requests from our suppliers for increases to their contracted prices, and such\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nrequests may be implemented in the future. In addition, several pharmacy suppliers have exercised force majeure clauses related to failure to supply clauses in their contracts with us because they are unable to obtain raw materials for manufacturing from India and China. The standard failure to supply language in our contracts contains financial penalties to suppliers if they are unable to supply products, which such suppliers may not be able to pay. In addition, we may not be able to source products from alternative suppliers on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Overall economic and capital markets decline. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in a prolonged recession or depression in the United States or globally that could harm the banking system, limit demand for all products and services and cause other seen and unforeseen events and circumstances, all of which could negatively impact us. The continued spread of COVID-19 has led to and could continue to lead to severe disruption and volatility in the United States and global capital markets, which could increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets in the future. In addition, trading prices on the public stock market, including our Class A common stock, have been highly volatile as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Managing the evolving regulatory environment.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, recurrences, or future similar pandemics may also exacerbate many of the other risks described in this \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" section. Despite our efforts to manage these impacts, their ultimate impact depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of any outbreak and actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects. The foregoing and other continued disruptions in our business as a result of COVID-19 could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, prospects and the trading prices of our securities in the near-term and beyond 2020.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nBelow is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. These and other significant accounting policies are set forth under Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for nore information.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for acquisitions of a business using the acquisition method. All the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies and contingent consideration are generally recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related costs are recorded as expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.\nSeveral valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we typically use the income method. This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows for each asset. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset's life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory or economic barriers to entry. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized. We perform our annual goodwill impairment testing on the first day of the last fiscal quarter of its fiscal year unless impairment indicators are present which could require an interim impairment test.\nUnder accounting rules, we may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. This qualitative assessment requires an evaluation of any excess of fair value over the carrying value for a reporting unit and significant judgment regarding potential changes in valuation inputs, including a review of our most recent long-range projections, analysis of operating results versus the prior year, changes in market values, changes in discount rates and changes in terminal growth rate assumptions. If it is determined that an impairment is more likely than not to exist, then we are\nrequired to perform a quantitative assessment to determine whether or not goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if any.\nA goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis as well as market-based approaches. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analyses are based on the most recent budget and long-term forecast. The discount rates used in the discounted cash flow analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units. The market comparable approach estimates fair value using market multiples of various financial measures compared to a set of comparable public companies and recent comparable transactions.\nOur most recent annual impairment testing as of April 1, 2020 consisted of a quantitative assessment and did not result in any goodwill impairment charges. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, we performed an interim assessment of goodwill and other long-lived assets of the specialty pharmacy business for impairment following the announcement of our commitment to sell certain assets of the specialty pharmacy business and to wind down and exit the specialty pharmacy business. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations and Exit Activities to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further information.\nLeases\nWe enter into lease contracts in which we are the lessee, substantially all of which are related to office space leased in various buildings used for general corporate purposes. The terms of these non-cancelable operating leases typically require us to pay rent and a share of operating expenses and real estate taxes, generally with an inflation-based rent increase included. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nOperating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term beginning at the commencement date. Operating lease right-of-use assets are adjusted for lease incentives, deferred rent and initial direct costs, if incurred. Our leases generally do not include an implicit rate; therefore, we determined the present value of future minimum lease payments using an incremental borrowing rate based on information available as of July 1, 2019, the transition date. The related lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nTRA\nWe record tax receivable agreement (\"TRA\") liabilities based on 85% of the estimated amount of tax savings we expect to receive, generally over a 15-year period, in connection with the additional tax benefits created in conjunction with the initial public offering (\"IPO\"). Absent a TRA Termination Event, tax payments under the TRA will be made to the member owners as we realize tax benefits attributable to the initial purchase of Class B common units from the member owners made concurrently with the IPO and any subsequent exchanges of Class B common units into Class A common stock or cash between us and the member owners. Determining the estimated amount of tax savings we expect to receive requires judgment as deductibility of goodwill amortization expense is not assured and the estimate of tax savings is dependent upon the actual realization of the tax benefit and the tax rates in effect at that time.\nChanges in estimated TRA liabilities that are the result of a change in tax accounting method are recorded in remeasurement of tax receivable agreement liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Changes in estimated TRA liabilities that are related to new basis changes as a result of the exchange of Class B common units for a like number of shares of Class A common stock or as a result of departed member owners are recorded as an increase or decrease to additional paid-in capital in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity (Deficit).\nRevenue Recognition\nWe account for a contract with a customer when the contract is committed, the rights of the parties, including payment terms, are identified, the contract has commercial substance and consideration is probable of collection.\nRevenue is recognized when, or as, control of a promised product or service transfers to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring those products or services. If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, we estimate the amount to which we expect to be entitled using either the expected value or most likely amount method. Our contracts may include terms that could cause variability in the transaction price, including, for example, revenue share, rebates, discounts, and variable fees based on performance.\nWe only include estimated amounts of consideration in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. These estimates require management to make complex, difficult or subjective judgments, and to make estimates about the effect of matters\ninherently uncertain. As such, we may not be able to reliably estimate variable fees based on performance in certain long-term arrangements due to uncertainties that are not expected to be resolved for a long period of time or when our experience with similar types of contracts is limited. Estimates of variable consideration and the determination of whether to include estimated amounts of consideration in the transaction price are based on information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction and the specific facts and circumstances of each arrangement. Additionally, management performs periodic analyses to verify the accuracy of estimates for variable consideration.\nAlthough we believe that our approach in developing estimates and reliance on certain judgments and underlying inputs is reasonable, actual results could differ which may result in exposure of increases or decreases in revenue that could be material.\nPerformance Obligations\nA performance obligation is a promise to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Contracts may have a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer individual goods or services is not separately identifiable from other promises, and therefore, not distinct, while other contracts may have multiple performance obligations, most commonly due to the contract covering multiple deliverable arrangements (licensing fees, implementation fees, subscription fees, professional fees for consulting services, etc.).\nNet Administrative Fees Revenue\nNet administrative fees revenue is a single performance obligation earned through a series of distinct daily services and includes maintaining a network of members to participate in the group purchasing program and providing suppliers efficiency in contracting and access to our members. Revenue is generated through administrative fees received from suppliers and is included in service revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.\nWe, through our GPO programs, aggregate member purchasing power to negotiate pricing discounts and improve contract terms with suppliers. Contracted suppliers pay us administrative fees which generally represent 1% to 3% of the purchase price of goods and services sold to members under the contracts we have negotiated. Administrative fees are variable consideration and are recognized as earned based upon estimated purchases by our members utilizing analytics based on historical member spend and updates for current trends and expectations. Administrative fees are estimated due to the difference in timing of when a member purchases on a supplier contract and when we receive the purchasing information. Member and supplier contracts substantiate persuasive evidence of an arrangement. We do not take title to the underlying equipment or products purchased by members through our GPO supplier contracts. Administrative fee revenue receivable is included in contract assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe pay a revenue share equal to a percentage of gross administrative fees, which is estimated according to the members' contractual agreements with us using a portfolio approach based on historical revenue fee share percentages and adjusted for current or anticipated trends. Revenue share is recognized as a reduction to gross administrative fees revenue to arrive at a net administrative fees revenue, and the corresponding revenue share liability is included in revenue share obligations in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nProduct Revenue\nDirect sourcing generates revenue through products sold to distributors, hospitals and other customers. Revenue is recognized once control of products has been transferred to the customer and is recorded net of discounts and rebates offered to customers. Discounts and rebates are estimated based on contractual terms and historical trends.\nOther Services and Support Revenue\nWithin Performance Services, which provides technology with wrap-around service offerings, revenue consists of SaaS clinical analytics products subscriptions, perpetual and term licenses, performance improvement collaboratives and other service subscriptions, professional fees for consulting services, third-party administrator fees for the direct to employer initiative and insurance services management fees and commissions from group-sponsored insurance programs.\nSaaS clinical analytics subscriptions include the right to use our proprietary hosted technology on a SaaS basis, training and member support to deliver improvements in cost management, quality and safety, value-based care and provider analytics. SaaS arrangements create a single performance obligation for each subscription within the contract in which the nature of the obligation is a stand-ready obligation, and each day of service meets the criteria for over time recognition. Pricing varies by application and size of healthcare system. Clinical analytics subscriptions are generally three- to five-year agreements with automatic renewal clauses and annual price escalators that typically do not allow for early termination. These agreements do not allow for physical possession of the software. Subscription fees are typically billed on a monthly basis and revenue is recognized as a single deliverable on a\nstraight-line basis over the remaining contractual period following implementation. Implementation involves the completion of data preparation services that are unique to each member's data set and, in certain cases, the installation of member site-specific software, in order to access and transfer member data into our hosted SaaS clinical analytics products. Implementation is generally 60 to 240 days following contract execution before the SaaS clinical analytics products can be fully utilized by the member.\nWe sell perpetual and term licenses that include post-contract customer support in the form of maintenance and support services. Pricing varies by application and size of healthcare system. Fees for the initial period include the license fees, implementation fees and the initial bundled maintenance and support services fees. The maintenance fees for the initial period are recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining initial period following implementation. Subsequent renewal maintenance and support services fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractually stated renewal periods. Implementation services are provided to the customer prior to the use of the software and do not involve significant customization or modification. Implementation is generally 250 to 300 days following contract execution before the licensed software products can be fully utilized by the member.\nRevenue from performance improvement collaboratives and other service subscriptions that support our offerings in cost management, quality and safety, and value-based care is recognized over the service period as the services are provided, which is generally one year. Performance improvement collaboratives and other services subscriptions revenue is considered one performance obligation and is generated by providing customers access to online communities whereby data is housed and available for analytics and benchmarking.\nProfessional fees for consulting services are sold under contracts, the terms of which vary based on the nature of the engagement. These services typically include general consulting, report-based consulting and cost savings initiatives. Promised services under such consulting engagements are typically not considered distinct and are regularly combined and accounted for as one performance obligation. Fees are billed as stipulated in the contract, and revenue is recognized on a proportional performance method as services are performed or when deliverables are provided. In situations where the contracts have significant contract performance guarantees, the performance guarantees are estimated and accounted for as a form of variable consideration when determining the transaction price. In the event that guaranteed savings levels are not achieved, we may have to perform additional services at no additional charge in order to achieve the guaranteed savings or pay the difference between the savings that were guaranteed and the actual achieved savings. Occasionally, our entitlement to consideration is predicated on the occurrence of an event such as the delivery of a report for which client acceptance is required. However, except for event-driven point-in-time transactions, the majority of services provided within this service line are delivered over time due to the continuous benefit provided to our customers.\nConsulting arrangements can require significant estimates for the transaction price and estimated number of hours within an engagement. These estimates are based on the expected value which is derived from outcomes from historical contracts that are similar in nature and forecasted amounts based on anticipated savings for the new agreements. The transaction price is generally constrained until the target transaction price becomes more certain.\nThird party administrator fees for our direct to employer initiative consist of integrated fees for the processing of self-insured health care plan claims. Third party administrator fees are invoiced to customers on a monthly basis and typically collected in that period. Revenue is recognized in the period in which the services have been provided.\nInsurance services management fees are recognized in the period in which such services are provided. Commissions from group sponsored insurance programs are earned by acting as an intermediary in the placement of effective insurance policies. Under this arrangement, revenue is recognized at a point in time on the effective date of the associated policies when control of the policy transfers to the customer and is constrained for estimated early terminations.\nMultiple Deliverable Arrangements\nWe enter into agreements where the individual deliverables discussed above, such as SaaS subscriptions and consulting services, are bundled into a single service arrangement. These agreements are generally provided over a time period ranging from approximately three months to five years after the applicable contract execution date. Revenue, including both fixed and variable consideration, is allocated to the individual performance obligations within the arrangement based on the stand-alone selling price when it is sold separately in a stand-alone arrangement.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue consists of unrecognized revenue related to advanced customer invoicing or member payments received prior to fulfillment of our revenue recognition criteria. Substantially all deferred revenue consists of deferred subscription fees and deferred consulting fees. Subscription fees for Company-hosted SaaS applications are deferred until the customer's unique data records have been incorporated into the underlying software database, or until customer site-specific software has been implemented and the customer has access to the software. Deferred consulting fees arise upon invoicing to customers prior to services being performed.\nSoftware Development Costs\nCosts associated with internally developed computer software that are incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. During the development stage, direct consulting costs and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees that are directly associated with each project are capitalized. Internal use capitalized software costs are included in property and equipment, net in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related software applications of up to five years and amortization is included in cost of revenue or selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, based on the software's end use. Replacements and major improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this process involve determining the stages of the software development project, the direct costs to capitalize and the estimated useful life of the capitalized software.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates as well as net operating losses and credit carryforwards, which will be in effect when these differences reverse. We provide a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets when, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe prepare and file tax returns based on interpretations of tax laws and regulations. Our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities in the normal course of business. Such examinations may result in future tax, interest and penalty assessments by these taxing authorities.\nIn determining our tax expense for financial reporting purposes, we establish a reserve for uncertain income tax positions unless it is determined to be \"more likely than not\" that such tax positions would be sustained upon examination, based on their technical merits. That is, for financial reporting purposes, we only recognize tax benefits taken on the tax return if we believe it is \"more likely than not\" that such tax positions would be sustained. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether it is \"more likely than not\" that positions taken on the tax returns would be sustained.\nWe adjust tax reserve estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by, and settlements with, varying taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations. The consolidated tax expense of any given year includes adjustments to prior year income tax reserve and related estimated interest charges that are considered appropriate. Our policy is to recognize, when applicable, interest and penalties on uncertain income tax positions as part of income tax expense.\nNew Accounting Standards\nNew accounting standards that we have recently adopted as well as those that have been recently issued but not yet adopted by us are included in Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nAs further described in Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies, we adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (\"New Lease Standard\") effective July 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. The modified retrospective approach resulted in recognizing the cumulative effect of initially applying the New Lease Standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of equity at July 1, 2019. Therefore, the comparative information is presented in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 840 (\"Previous Lease Standard\").\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nNet Revenue\nNet revenue consists of service revenue, which includes net administrative fees revenue and other services and support revenue, and product revenue. Net administrative fees revenue consists of GPO administrative fees in our Supply Chain Services segment. Other services and support revenue consists primarily of fees generated by our Performance Services segment in connection with our SaaS and licensed-based clinical analytics products subscriptions, license fees, third party administrator fees and consulting services and performance improvement collaborative subscriptions. Product revenue consists of direct sourcing product sales, which are included in the Supply Chain Services segment.\nSupply Chain Services\nSupply Chain Services revenue consists of GPO net administrative fees (gross administrative fees received from suppliers, reduced by the amount of any revenue share paid to members), supply chain co-management and direct sourcing revenue.\nThe success of our Supply Chain Services revenue streams are influenced by our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with suppliers and members, the number of members that utilize our GPO supplier contracts and the volume of their purchases, as well as the impact of changes in the defined allowable reimbursement amounts determined by Medicare, Medicaid and other managed care plans and the number of members that purchase products through our direct sourcing activities and the impact of competitive pricing.\nPerformance Services\nPerformance Services revenue consists of SaaS clinical analytics products subscriptions, license fees, performance improvement collaborative and other service subscriptions, professional fees for consulting services, third party administrator fees for our direct to employer initiative and insurance services management fees and commissions from group-sponsored insurance programs.\nOur Performance Services growth will depend upon the expansion of our SaaS clinical analytics products, performance improvement collaboratives and consulting services to new and existing members, renewal of existing subscriptions to our SaaS and licensed informatics products, and our ability to generate additional applied sciences engagements and expand into new markets.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists of cost of service revenue and cost of product revenue.\nCost of service revenue includes expenses related to employees (including compensation and benefits) and outside consultants who directly provide services related to revenue-generating activities, including consulting services to members and implementation services related to SaaS clinical analytics along with associated amortization of certain capitalized contract costs. Amortization of contract costs represent amounts that have been capitalized and reflect the incremental costs of obtaining and fulfilling a contract. Amortization of contract costs included within cost of service revenue include costs related to implementing SaaS informatics tools. Cost of service revenue also includes expenses related to hosting services, related data center capacity costs, third-party product license expenses and amortization of the cost of internally developed software applications.\nCost of product revenue consists of purchase and shipment costs for direct sourced medical products. Our cost of product revenue is influenced by the manufacturing and transportation costs associated with direct sourced medical products.\nOther Operating Income\nOther operating income includes the adjustment to TRA liabilities. Changes in estimated TRA liabilities that are the result of a change in tax accounting method, including the impacts of the TCJA, are recorded as a component of other operating income in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Changes in estimated TRA liabilities that are related to new basis changes as a result of the exchange of Class B common units for a like number of shares of Class A common stock or as a result of departed member owners are recorded as an increase or decrease to additional paid-in capital in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity (Deficit). See \"Income Tax Expense\" below for additional information.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses are directly associated with selling and administrative functions and support of revenue-generating activities including expenses to support and maintain our software-related products and services. Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation and benefits related costs, travel-related expenses, business development expenses, including costs for business acquisition opportunities, business disposition related expenses, indirect costs such as insurance, professional fees and other general overhead expenses, and amortization of certain contract costs. Amortization of contract costs represent amounts that have been capitalized and reflect the incremental costs of obtaining and fulfilling a contract. Amortization of contract costs included within selling, general and administrative expenses include sales commissions.\nResearch and development expenses consist of employee-related compensation and benefit expenses and third-party consulting fees of technology professionals, net of capitalized labor, incurred to develop our software-related products and services.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets includes the amortization of all identified intangible assets.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net, includes equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates that is generated from our equity method investments. Our equity method investments primarily consist of our 49% ownership in FFF Enterprises, Inc. (\"FFF\"). Other income (expense), net, also includes the change in fair value of our FFF put and call rights (see Note 6 - Fair Value Measurements),\ninterest income and expense, realized and unrealized gains or losses on deferred compensation plan assets, gains or losses on the disposal of assets, and any impairment on our held-to-maturity investments.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur income tax expense is attributable to the activities of Premier, Inc., PHSI, PSCI and Premier Marketplace, LLC (\"PMLLC\"), all of which are subchapter C corporations and are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. In contrast, under the provisions of federal and state laws, Premier LP is not subject to federal and state income taxes as the income realized by Premier LP is taxable to its partners. Our overall effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the ownership structure as well as other items noted in Note 16 - Income Taxes.\nGiven our ownership and capital structure, various effective tax rates are calculated for specific tax items. For example, the deferred tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense (see Note 14 - Stock-Based Compensation) is calculated based on the effective tax rate of PHSI, the legal entity where the majority of stock-based compensation expense is recorded. Our effective tax rate, as discussed in Note 16 - Income Taxes, represents the effective tax rate computed in accordance with GAAP based on total income tax expense (reflected in income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income) of Premier, Inc., PHSI, PSCI and PMLLC divided by consolidated pre-tax income.\nAdjusted Fully Distributed Net Income, a Non-GAAP financial measure as defined below in \"Our Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\", is calculated net of taxes based on our fully distributed estimated statutory tax rate for federal and state income tax for us as if we were one consolidated taxable group with all of our subsidiaries' activities included. Prior to the enactment of the TCJA, the tax rate used to compute the Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income was 39%. Effective January 1, 2018, we used a fully distributed tax rate of 26% to compute the Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income.\nIncome (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax represents the net income or loss associated with the sale of certain assets and wind down and exit of the specialty pharmacy business. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations and Exit Activities for further information.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interest\nAs of June 30, 2020, we owned a 59% controlling general partner interest in Premier LP through Premier GP. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest represents the portion of net income attributable to the limited partners of Premier LP, which was 41% and 51% as of June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively (see Note 11 - Redeemable Limited Partners' Capital).\nOur Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe other key business metrics we consider are EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Segment Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income, Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share and Free Cash Flow, which are all Non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe define EBITDA as net income before income or loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, interest and investment income, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and amortization of purchased intangible assets. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before merger and acquisition related expenses and non-recurring, non-cash or non-operating items and including equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates. For all Non-GAAP financial measures, we consider non-recurring items to be income or expenses and other items that have not been earned or incurred within the prior two years and are not expected to recur within the next two years. Such items include certain strategic and financial restructuring expenses. Non-operating items include gains or losses on the disposal of assets and interest and investment income or expense.\nWe define Segment Adjusted EBITDA as the segment's net revenue less cost of revenue and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment excluding depreciation and amortization, amortization of purchased intangible assets, merger and acquisition related expenses and non-recurring or non-cash items and including equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates. Operating expenses directly attributable to the segment include expenses associated with sales and marketing, general and administrative, and product development activities specific to the operation of each segment. General and administrative corporate expenses that are not specific to a particular segment are not included in the calculation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment Adjusted EBITDA also excludes any income and expense that has been classified as discontinued operations.\nWe define Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income as net income attributable to Premier (i) excluding income or loss from discontinued operations, net, (ii) excluding income tax expense, (iii) excluding the impact of adjustment of redeemable limited partners' capital to redemption amount, (iv) excluding the effect of non-recurring and non-cash items, (v) assuming the exchange of all the Class B common units for shares of Class A common stock, which results in the elimination of non-controlling interest in Premier LP and (vi) reflecting an adjustment for income tax expense on adjusted fully distributed net income before income\ntaxes at our estimated effective income tax rate. We define Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share as Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income divided by diluted weighted average shares (see Note 13 - Earnings (Loss) Per Share).\nWe define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less distributions and TRA payments to limited partners and purchases of property and equipment. Free Cash Flow does not represent discretionary cash available for spending as it excludes certain contractual obligations such as debt repayments.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are supplemental financial measures used by us and by external users of our financial statements and are considered to be indicators of the operational strength and performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow measures allow us to assess our performance without regard to financing methods and capital structure and without the impact of other matters that we do not consider indicative of the operating performance of our business. More specifically, Segment Adjusted EBITDA is the primary earnings measure we use to evaluate the performance of our business segments.\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA, Segment Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income and Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA assist our Board of Directors, management and investors in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period because they remove the impact of earnings elements attributable to our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization), certain items outside the control of our management team, e.g. taxes, other non-cash items (such as impairment of intangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments and stock-based compensation), non-recurring items (such as strategic and financial restructuring expenses) and income and expense that has been classified as discontinued operations from our operating results. We believe Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income and Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share assist our Board of Directors, management and investors in comparing our net income and earnings per share on a consistent basis from period to period because these measures remove non-cash (such as impairment of intangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments and stock-based compensation), non-recurring items (such as strategic and financial restructuring expenses), and eliminate the variability of non-controlling interest that results from member owner exchanges of Class B common units for shares of Class A common stock. We believe Free Cash Flow is an important measure because it represents the cash that we generate after payment of tax distributions to limited partners and capital investment to maintain existing products and services and ongoing business operations, as well as development of new and upgraded products and services to support future growth. Our Free Cash Flow allows us to enhance stockholder value through acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures, investments in related businesses and debt reduction.\nDespite the importance of these Non-GAAP financial measures in analyzing our business, determining compliance with certain financial covenants in our Credit Facility, measuring and determining incentive compensation and evaluating our operating performance relative to our competitors, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Segment Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income, Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share and Free Cash Flow are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, may have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, net income, net cash provided by operating activities, or any other measure of our performance derived in accordance with GAAP.\nSome of the limitations of the EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA measures include that they do not reflect: our capital expenditures or our future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; the interest expense or the cash requirements to service interest or principal payments under our Credit Facility; income tax payments we are required to make; and any cash requirements for replacements of assets being depreciated or amortized. In addition, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are not measures of liquidity under GAAP, or otherwise, and are not alternatives to cash flows from operating activities.\nSome of the limitations of the Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income and Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share measures are that they do not reflect income tax expense or income tax payments we are required to make. In addition, Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income and Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share are not measures of profitability under GAAP.\nWe also urge you to review the reconciliation of these Non-GAAP financial measures included elsewhere in this Annual Report. To properly and prudently evaluate our business, we encourage you to review the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report, and to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. In addition, because the EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Segment Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income, Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share and Free Cash Flow measures are susceptible to varying calculations, such Non-GAAP financial measures may differ from, and may therefore not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nNon-recurring and non-cash items excluded in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income consist of stock-based compensation, acquisition and disposition related expenses, remeasurement of TRA liabilities, loss on disposal of long-lived assets, gain or loss on FFF put and call rights, income and expense that has been classified as discontinued operations and other expense. More information about certain of the more significant items follows below.\nStock-based compensation\nIn addition to non-cash employee stock-based compensation expense, this item includes non-cash stock purchase plan expense of $0.4 million during each of the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nAcquisition and disposition related expenses\nAcquisition related expenses include legal, accounting and other expenses related to acquisition activities and gains and losses on the change in fair value of earn-out liabilities. Disposition related expenses include severance and retention benefits and financial advisor fees and legal fees related to disposition activities.\nRemeasurement of TRA liabilities\nWe record TRA liabilities based on 85% of the estimated amount of tax savings we expect to receive, generally over a 15-year period, which are attributable to the initial purchase of Class B common units from the member owners made concurrently with the IPO and subsequent exchanges by member owners of Class B common units into Class A common stock or cash. Tax payments made under the TRA will be made to the member owners as we realize tax benefits. Determining the estimated amount of tax savings we expect to receive requires judgment as deductibility of goodwill amortization expense is not assured and the estimate of tax savings is dependent upon the actual realization of the tax benefit and the tax rates in effect at that time.\nChanges in estimated TRA liabilities that are the result of a change in tax accounting method, including the impacts of the TCJA, are recorded as a component of other operating income or selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Changes in estimated TRA liabilities that are related to new basis changes as a result of the exchange of Class B common units for a like number of shares of Class A common stock or as a result of departed member owners are recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity (Deficit).\nThe adjustment to TRA liabilities for the year ended June 30, 2020 is primarily attributable to increases in the Premier, Inc. effective tax rate related to state tax liabilities (see Note 16 - Income Taxes). The adjustment to TRA liabilities for the year ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to the 14% decrease in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, which occurred as a result of the TCJA that was enacted on December 22, 2017.\nGain or loss on FFF put and call rights\nSee Note 6 - Fair Value Measurements.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nResults of operations for all periods presented have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect continuing operations unless otherwise indicated.\nThe following table presents our results of operations for the

These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $11.9 million in other services and support revenue.\nNet revenue increased by $32.9 million, or 3%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to an increase of $18.7 million in net administrative fees revenue, an increase of $2.5 million in other services and support revenue and an increase of $11.9 million in product revenue.\nThe variances in the material factors contributing to the changes in consolidated net revenue are discussed further in \"Segment Results\" below.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue increased by $77.2 million, or 22%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to an increase of $71.2 million in cost of product revenue and an increase of $5.9 million in cost of services revenue.\nCost of revenue increased $13.6 million, or 4%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to an increase of $18.7 million in cost of product revenue partially offset by a decrease of $5.0 million in cost of services revenue.\nThe variances in the material factors contributing to the changes in consolidated cost of revenue are discussed further in \"Segment Results\" below.\nOther Operating Income\nOther operating income of $24.6 million during the year ended June 30, 2020 is attributable to the remeasurement of the TRA liability as a result of the change in North Carolina state income tax law. Other operating income of $177.2 million during the year ended June 30, 2018 is attributable to the remeasurement of TRA liabilities driven by the 14% decrease in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate associated with the TCJA that was enacted on December 22, 2017.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses increased by $24.3 million during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to an increase of $20.9 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, an increase of $2.2 million in amortization of intangible assets and an increase of $1.2 million in research and development expenses.\nOperating expenses increased by $14.0 million, or 3%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to driven by an increase of $13.7 million in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nThe variances in the material factors contributing to the changes in consolidated operating expense are discussed further in \"Segment Results\" below.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $20.9 million, or 5%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $13.7 million, or 3%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. The variances in the material factors contributing to the changes in consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses are discussed further in \"Segment Results\" below.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist of employee-related compensation and benefit expenses and third-party consulting fees for technology professionals, net of capitalized labor, incurred to develop our software-related products and services. Research and development expenses increased by $1.2 million, or 100%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. Research and development remained flat during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018.\nTotal capitalized labor and research and development expenditures decreased by $1.7 million to $79.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2020. Total capitalized labor and research and development expenditures increased by $4.3 million to $80.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. We experience fluctuations in our research and development expenditures across reportable periods due to the timing of our software development lifecycles, new product features and functionality, new technologies and upgrades to our service offerings.\nAmortization of Purchased Intangible Assets\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets increased by $2.2 million, or 4%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. Amortization of purchased intangible assets remained flat during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. The variances in the material factors contributing to the changes in consolidated amortization of purchased intangible assets are discussed further in \"Segment Results\" below.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net increased by $10.5 million during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to an increase of $6.8 million in equity in net income from our investments in unconsolidated affiliates and a decrease of $6.2 million in losses on disposals of long-lived assets.\nOther (expense) income, net increased by $22.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to the $22.0 million loss on FFF put and call rights in the prior year and the impairment on investments recorded in the prior year.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense increased by $59.1 million, or 176%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to an increase in deferred tax expense related to deferred tax remeasurement as a result of North Carolina state tax law changes.\nIncome tax expense decreased by $226.0 million, or 87%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. The decrease was largely driven by the tax expenses recorded in fiscal year 2018 associated with the remeasurement of deferred tax balances related to the reduction in the statutory rate from 35% to 21% as a result of the TCJA. See Note 16 - Income Taxes for more information.\nIncome (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax was $1.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to the substantial completion of the wind down of the specialty pharmacy business.\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax was $50.6 million for year ended June 30, 2019 and primarily included the $80.4 million non-cash impairment charge related to an interim assessment of goodwill and other long-lived assets of the specialty pharmacy business that were not sold or did not have an alternative use for impairment. In addition, the loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased due to less revenue generated from the specialty pharmacy business during the current year due to the wind down of the business that was initiated on June 7, 2019. These increases were partially offset by the cash proceeds received from the sale. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations and Exit Activities for more information.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interest\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest decreased by $13.2 million, or 8%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to a decrease in non-controlling ownership interest percentage in Premier LP to 41% from 51%.\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest decreased by $49.3 million, or 22%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to a decrease in non-controlling ownership interest percentage in Premier LP to 51% from 60%, as well as a decrease in Premier LP net income, which was largely driven by the increased loss from discontinued operations, net of tax in the current year.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA, a Non-GAAP financial measure as defined in \"Our Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\", increased by $3.0 million, or 1%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 driven by an increase of $22.3 million in Supply Chain Services partially offset by decreases of $17.9 million and $1.4 million in Performance Services and Corporate, respectively.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by $21.5 million, or 4%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 driven by increases of $16.2 million and $5.7 million in Supply Chain Services and Performance Services, respectively, partially offset by a decrease of $0.4 million in Corporate.\nThe variances in the material factors contributing to the changes in consolidated Adjusted EBITDA are discussed further in \"Segment Results\" below.\nSegment Results\nSupply Chain Services\nThe following

30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. Supply Chain Services segment revenue increased by $31.2 million, or 4%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018.\nNet Administrative Fees Revenue\nNet administrative fees revenue increased $8.1 million, or 1%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. Growth in net administrative fees revenue was primarily due to continuing contract penetration driven largely by the company's high-compliance portfolio programs and the addition of new contract categories and suppliers. The growth in net administrative fees was largely offset by the impact of COVID-19 during the three months ended June 30, 2020, which significantly impacted full year growth.\nWe anticipate lower net administrative fees in fiscal year 2021 due to the amendment and extension of GPO participation agreements and the ongoing impact from COVID-19. However, once the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided and we move into fiscal year 2022, we expect our net administrative fees revenue to grow to the extent our existing members increase the utilization of our contracts and additional members convert to our contract portfolio. Due to competitive market trends, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, requests, at times, to provide existing and prospective members increases in revenue share on\nincremental or overall purchasing volume that could, if materially increased, adversely impact our revenues and overall financial performance.\nNet administrative fees revenue increased by $18.6 million, or 3%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018, due in part to the impact of revenue recognition under the New Revenue Standard. Net administrative fees recognized in the year ended June 30, 2019 under the Previous Revenue Standard increased $10.5 million, or 2%, over the prior year. Growth was primarily due to further contract penetration of existing members and, to a lesser degree, the impact of conversion of new members to our portfolio, partially offset by higher revenue recoveries in the prior year.\nOther Services and Support Revenue\nOther services and support revenue increased by $3.7 million, or 43%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due supply chain co-management fees as a result of the asset acquisition of Nexera as well as continued growth in our strategic initiatives.\nOther services and support revenue increased by $0.7 million, or 10%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. Growth in service fees from our strategic initiatives of $5.4 million was offset by the impact of revenue recognition under the New Revenue Standard related to our partnership with a third party to provide pharmacy benefit management services.\nProduct Revenue\nProduct revenue increased by $85.8 million, or 47%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by the aggregated purchasing of personal protective equipment as a result of COVID-19 and growth in commodity products and aggregated purchasing of certain products.\nProduct revenue increased by $11.8 million, or 7%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by growth in commodity products and aggregated purchasing of certain products, partially offset by the $3.1 million impact of revenue recognition under the New Revenue Standard on distributor fees, which were historically recognized on a gross basis under the Previous Revenue Standard but are now recognized on a net basis under the New Revenue Standard.\nWe expect continued near-term growth of our direct sourcing product revenues due to the impact of COVID-19. Long-term, we expect our direct sourcing product revenues to continue to grow to the extent we are able to increase our product offerings, expand our product sales to existing members and additional members begin to utilize our programs.\nCost of Revenue\nSupply Chain Services segment cost of revenue increased by $71.5 million, or 41%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019, and increased by $14.0 million, or 9%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018.\nCost of services revenue remained flat during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. Cost of services revenue decreased by $4.6 million, or 95%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to the impact of revenue recognition under the New Revenue Standard on the recognition of costs associated with our partnership with a third party to provide pharmacy benefit management services,\nCost of product revenue increased by $71.3 million, or 41%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 and increased by $18.6 million, or 12%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. These increases were both driven by higher costs associated with the aforementioned growth in direct sourcing sales, which during the year ended June 30, 2020 was significantly impacted by COVID-19. We expect our cost of product revenue to increase to the extent we are able to sell additional direct-sourced medical products to new and existing members. Increases in cost of product revenues could reduce our gross profit as a percentage of our net revenues depending on the underlying product sales mix.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses increased by $21.5 million, or 13%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to an increase of $16.1 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and an increase of $5.4 million in intangible asset amortization.\nOperating expenses decreased by $1.2 million, or 1%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to a decrease of $1.2 million in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $16.1 million, or 11%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 driven by increased expenses associated with current year acquisitions and expenses associated with our strategic initiatives. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in employee travel and meeting expenses as a result of the elimination of employee travel due to COVID-19.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $1.2 million during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. Expenses decreased due to the impact of the New Revenue Standard on distributor fees associated with direct sourcing revenue and due to decreased general overhead expenses in the current year. These decreases were offset by increased expenses associated with our strategic initiatives.\nAmortization of Purchased Intangible Assets\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets increased by $5.4 million, or 31%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 driven by additional amortization of purchased intangible assets related to acquisitions. Amortization of purchased intangible assets remained flat during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018.\nAs we execute on our growth strategy and further deploy capital, we expect increases in amortization of intangible assets in connection with future potential acquisitions.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA in the Supply Chain Services segment increased by $22.3 million, or 4%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. The increase was driven by growth in net administrative fees revenue, an increase in product revenue driven by aggregated purchasing of certain products as a result of COVID-19 and growth in commodity products, an increase in earnings from our 49% equity investment with FFF and a decrease in employee travel and meeting expenses as a result of the elimination of employee travel due to COVID-19. These increases were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses as a result of current year acquisitions as well as the significant impact of COVID-19 to the full year growth of net administrative fees revenue during the three months ended June 30, 2020.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA in the Supply Chain Services segment increased by $16.2 million, or 3%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. The increase was primarily a result of growth in net administrative fees revenue and growth in service fees from our academic initiative, partially offset by a decline in gross margin associated with product revenue.\nPerformance Services\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations and Adjusted EBITDA in the Performance Services segment for the fiscal years presented (in

Revenue\nOther services and support revenue in our Performance Services segment decreased by $15.6 million, or 4%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower demand in consulting services and a decrease in revenue as a result of the planned reduction and subsequent discontinuance of the Hospital Improvement Innovation Network contract. These decreases were partially offset by growth in technology license contracts as a result of new enterprise license agreements.\nOther services and support revenue in our Performance Services segment increased by $1.8 million during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. The increase was driven by growth in applied sciences and cost management consulting services, as revenue is now recognized proportionally to when services are provided under the New Revenue Standard whereas revenue recognition was deferred in certain circumstances until certain performance conditions were met under the Previous Revenue Standard, as well as revenue from acquisitions, which contributed $3.7 million in growth. These increases were offset by the impact of revenue that was historically recognized on a gross basis under the Previous Revenue Standard but was recognized on a net basis under the New Revenue Standard and a decrease related to the timing of certain contracts ending in the cost management and quality and safety businesses.\nWe expect our other services and support revenue to grow over the long-term to the extent we are able to expand our sales to existing members and additional members begin to utilize our integrated platform of products and services.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of services revenue in our Performance Services segment increased by $5.7 million, or 3%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to increased amortization of internally-developed software applications.\nCost of services revenue in our Performance Services segment decreased by $0.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. An increase in amortization of internally developed software applications was offset by a decrease in salaries and benefits in the current year due to lower headcount as a result of staffing efficiencies implemented in the prior year and a decrease due to the impact of the New Revenue Standard on the recognition of certain consulting expenses which were historically recognized on a gross basis under the Previous Revenue Standard, but are now recognized on a net basis under the New Revenue Standard.\nWe expect cost of service revenue to increase to the extent we continue to develop new and enhance existing internally developed software applications, expand our consulting services and performance improvement collaboratives and expand into new product offerings.\nOperating Expenses\nPerformance Services segment operating expenses increased by $7.6 million, or 5%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019, and increased by $17.0 million, or 11%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $9.6 million, or 7%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 driven by increased expenses associated with acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in employee travel and meeting expenses as a result of the elimination of employee travel due to COVID-19.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $16.7 million, or 15%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 primarily driven by increased amortization of internally developed software applications, expenses associated with acquisitions and higher bad debt expense primarily due to a hospital bankruptcy.\nAmortization of Purchased Intangible Assets\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets decreased by $3.2 million, or 9%, to $32.6 million during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019, and remained relatively flat during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018.\nAs we execute on our growth strategy and further deploy capital, we expect increases in amortization of intangible assets in connection with future potential acquisitions.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA in the Performance Services segment decreased by $17.9 million, or 14%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily as a result of the aforementioned decrease in other services and support revenue and increase in operating expenses as a result of recent acquisitions partially offset by the decrease in employee travel and meeting expenses as a result of the elimination of employee travel due to COVID-19.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA in the Performance Services segment increased by $5.7 million, or 5%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 primarily as a result of increased other services and support revenue and decreased salaries and benefits expenses in the current year due to lower headcount as a result of staffing efficiencies implemented in the prior year, partially offset by incremental expense resulting from the acquisition in the current year and increased bad debt expense.\nCorporate\nThe following table summarizes corporate expenses and Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal years presented (in thousands):\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

Income\nOther operating income of $24.6 million during the year ended June 30, 2020 is attributable to the remeasurement of the TRA liability as a result of the change in North Carolina state income tax law. Other operating income of $177.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2018 represents the remeasurement of TRA liabilities driven by the 14% decrease in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate associated with the TCJA that was enacted on December 22, 2017.\nOperating Expenses\nCorporate operating expenses decreased by $4.8 million, or 3%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019, and decreased by $1.8 million, or 1%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $4.8 million, or 3%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019, primarily due a decrease in stock-based compensation expense due to lower achievement of certain performance targets relative to the prior year and a decrease in employee travel and meeting expenses as a result of the elimination of employee travel due to COVID-19. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in technology expenses driven by software subscriptions associated with recent acquisitions.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $1.8 million, or 1%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018, primarily driven by decreased salaries and benefits and travel expenses, partially offset by increased depreciation of purchased software and hardware.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased by $1.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 driven by an increase in technology expenses driven by software subscriptions associated with recent acquisitions partially offset by a decrease in employee travel and meeting expenses as a result of the elimination of employee travel due to COVID-19.\nAdjusted EBITDA remained relatively flat during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of June 30, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal source of cash has historically been cash provided by operating activities. From time to time we have used, and expect to use in the future, borrowings under our Credit Facility as a source of liquidity. Our primary cash requirements involve operating expenses, working capital fluctuations, revenue share obligations, tax payments, capital expenditures, dividend payments on our Class A common stock, if and when declared, repurchases of Class A common stock pursuant to stock repurchase programs in place from time to time, acquisitions and related business investments, and other general corporate activities. Our capital expenditures typically consist of internally developed software costs, software purchases and computer hardware purchases.\nAs of June 30, 2020 and 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $99.3 million and $141.1 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, there was $75.0 million and $25.0 million, respectively, of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. During the year ended June 30, 2020, we borrowed $400.0 million and repaid $350.0 million of borrowings under the Credit Facility, which was used to fund acquisitions during the current year, share repurchases under the fiscal 2020 stock repurchase program, and for other general corporate activities. On July 31, 2020, we repaid $25.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility.\nWe expect cash generated from operations and borrowings under our Credit Facility to provide us with adequate liquidity to fund our anticipated working capital requirements, revenue share obligations, tax payments, capital expenditures, dividend payments on our Class A common stock, if and when declared, and repurchases of Class A common stock pursuant to stock repurchase programs in place from time to time. Our capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including funding requirements for our product and service development and commercialization efforts, our information technology requirements and the amount of cash generated by our operations. We believe that we have adequate capital resources at our disposal to fund currently anticipated capital expenditures, business growth and expansion, and current and projected debt service requirements. However, strategic growth initiatives will likely require the use of one or a combination of various forms of capital resources including available cash on hand, cash generated from operations, borrowings under our Credit Facility and other long-term debt and, potentially, proceeds from the issuance of additional equity or debt securities.\nOn May 7, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300.0 million of our outstanding Class A common stock during fiscal year 2020. During fiscal year 2020, we purchased an aggregate of 4.6 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $32.28 per share for a total purchase price of $150.0 million under our fiscal year 2020 stock repurchase program. On August 5, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.19 per share, payable on September 15, 2020 to stockholders of record on September 1, 2020.\nDuring the second half of fiscal 2020, COVID-19 became a global pandemic that spread throughout the United States and much of the rest of the world. In addition to those who have been directly affected with the disease, millions more have been affected by government and voluntary efforts around the world to slow the spread of the pandemic through quarantines, travel restrictions, business shut-downs, heightened border security and other measures. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, the actions to contain it or treat its impact, including the timing, development and deployment of an effective vaccine, or recurrences of COVID-19 or similar pandemics. As discussed in detail under \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" above, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and potential future pandemic outbreaks, we face significant risks including but not limited to the following:\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We have experienced and may continue to experience demand uncertainty from both significant increases in demand for PPE, drugs and other products related to the treatment of COVID-19 and decreases in demand for non-COVID-19 related products.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our GPO member hospitals and non-acute care sites have experienced reduced or limited access for non-patients, including our field teams, consultants and other professionals, and travel restrictions have impacted our employees' ability to travel to our members' facilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The global supply chain has been significantly disrupted due to stay at home orders, border closings and rapidly escalating shipping costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We have and may continue to receive requests for contract modifications, payment waivers and deferrals, payment reductions or amended payment terms from our contract counterparties.

The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was driven by the prepaid contract administrative fee share of $93.8 million for one-time rebates paid by Acurity, Inc. to certain of its then members, as agreed to by Acurity, Inc. prior to entering into the Purchase Agreement. These payments were excluded from the purchase price of the Acurity and Nexera asset acquisition. As of June 30, 2020, we had capitalized $87.3 million on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized $6.5 million to net revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. In addition, the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to a decrease in our working capital primarily driven by the impact of the aggregated purchasing of personal protective equipment as a result of COVID-19, an increase in acquisition and disposition related expenses associated with certain strategic initiatives and lower profitability in our Performance Services segment. These decreases were partially offset by growth in net administrative fees revenue in our Supply Chain Services segment and the remeasurement of the TRA in the current period.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $93.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase of $70.8 million in cash paid for business acquisitions in the current year compared to cash paid for business acquisitions in the prior year. This increase was partially offset by lower proceeds received during the current year of $19.1 million due to the liquidation of property and equipment in connection with our exit from specialty pharmacy operations in June 2019.\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased by $218.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to year ended June 30, 2019. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase of $125.0 million in net borrowings under the Credit Facility, a decrease of $100.0 million in repurchases of Class A common stock under the current year stock repurchase program and a decrease of $8.9 million in distributions to limited partners of Premier LP. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in payments on the non-interest bearing notes payable to our departed member owners.\nNet cash provided by operating activities attributable to discontinued operations increased by $16.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to payments on liabilities that were outstanding as of June 30, 2019.\nDiscussion of Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow for the Years Ended June 30, 2020 and 2019\nWe define Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less distributions and TRA payments to limited partners and purchases of property and equipment. Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow does not represent discretionary cash available for spending as it excludes certain contractual obligations such as debt repayments. A summary of Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow and reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities for the periods presented follows (in thousands):\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended June 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations (a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>427,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>511,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchases of property and equipment\n</td> <td>(94,397\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(93,385\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions to limited partners of Premier LP\n</td> <td>(48,904\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(57,825\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payments to limited partners of Premier LP related to tax receivable agreements\n</td> <td>(17,425\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(17,975\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>266,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>342,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations excludes the impact of the prepaid administrative fee share for one-time rebates paid by Acurity, Inc. to certain of its then members, as agreed to by Acurity, Inc. prior to entering into the Purchase Agreement and the net change in the aforementioned prepaid administrative fee share capitalized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2020.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow decreased by $76.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to a decrease of $84.8 million in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations driven by prepayments for commodity products in response to increased demand due to COVID-19, partially offset by a decrease of $8.9 million in distributions to limited partners of Premier LP.\nSee \"Our Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" above for additional information regarding our use of Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow.\nContractual Obligations\nAt June 30, 2020, we had commitments for obligations under notes payable which represented obligations to departed member owners, our noncancelable office space lease agreements and estimated payments due to limited partners under the TRA.

The aggregate amount of the Early Termination Payments is approximately $473.5 million. Of that amount, approximately $10.6 million is payable within three business days after the date the Early Termination Payment becomes final, which is expected to be on or about September 15, 2020, to former limited partners that did not elect to execute Unit Exchange Agreements. Pursuant to the Unit Exchange Agreements, the remaining amount payable, approximately $462.9 million in the aggregate, will be paid, without interest, to former limited partners that elected to execute Unit Exchange Agreements in 18 equal quarterly installments commencing during the quarter ended March 31, 2021 and ending in the quarter ending June 30, 2025.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(c)\n</td> <td>Future contractual obligations for leases represent future minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases primarily for office space.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(d)\n</td> <td>Notes payable are non-interest bearing and represent an aggregate principal amount of $9.2 million owed to departed member owners, generally payable over five years from the respective departure dates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(e)\n</td> <td>Additional consideration to be paid pursuant to the Purchase Agreement for the Acurity and Nexera asset acquisition.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Credit Facility\nPremier LP, along with its consolidated subsidiaries, PSCI and PHSI, as Co-Borrowers, Premier GP and certain domestic subsidiaries of Premier GP, as guarantors, entered into an unsecured Credit Facility, dated as of November 9, 2018. The Credit Facility has a maturity date of November 9, 2023, subject to up to two one-year extensions at the request of the Co-Borrowers and approval of a majority of the lenders under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility provides for borrowings of up to $1.0 billion with (i) a $50.0 million sub-facility for standby letters of credit and (ii) a $100.0 million sub-facility for swingline loans. The Credit Facility also provides that Co-Borrowers may from time to time (i) incur incremental term loans and (ii) request an increase in the revolving commitments under the Credit Facility, together up to an aggregate of $350.0 million, subject to the approval of the lenders providing such term loans or revolving commitment increase. The Credit Facility includes an unconditional and irrevocable\nguaranty of all obligations under the Credit Facility by Premier GP, certain domestic subsidiaries of Premier GP and future guarantors, if any. Premier, Inc. is not a guarantor under the Credit Facility.\nAt our option, committed loans may be in the form of Eurodollar rate loans (\"Eurodollar Loans\") or base rate loans (\"Base Rate Loans\"). Eurodollar Loans bear interest at the Eurodollar rate (defined as the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus the Applicable Rate (defined as a margin based on the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility))). Base Rate Loans bear interest at the Base Rate (defined as the highest of the prime rate announced by the administrative agent, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, the one-month LIBOR plus 1.0% and 0.0%) plus the Applicable Rate. The Applicable Rate ranges from 1.000% to 1.500% for Eurodollar Loans and 0.000% to 0.500% for Base Rate Loans. In the event that LIBOR is no longer available, the Credit Facility states that interest will be calculated based upon rates offered to leading banks for comparable loans by leading banks in the London interbank market. At June 30, 2020, the interest rate for one-month Eurodollar Loans was 1.162% and the interest rate for Base Rate Loans was 3.250%. The Co-Borrowers are required to pay a commitment fee ranging from 0.100% to 0.200% per annum on the actual daily unused amount of commitments under the Credit Facility. At June 30, 2020, the commitment fee was 0.100%.\nThe Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among others, limitations on liens, indebtedness, fundamental changes, dispositions, restricted payments and investments. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, Premier GP's consolidated total net leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) may not exceed 3.75 to 1.00 for four consecutive quarters, provided that, in connection with any acquisition for which the aggregate consideration exceeds $250.0 million, the maximum consolidated total net leverage ratio may increase to 4.25 to 1.00 for the four consecutive fiscal quarters beginning with the quarter in which such acquisition is completed. In addition, Premier GP must maintain a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) of 2.50 to 1.00 at the end of every fiscal quarter. Premier GP was in compliance with all such covenants at June 30, 2020.\nThe Credit Facility also contains customary events of default including, among others, payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults of any indebtedness or guarantees in excess of $75.0 million, bankruptcy and other insolvency events, ERISA-related liabilities and judgment defaults in excess of $50.0 million, and the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the Credit Facility). If any event of default occurs and is continuing, the administrative agent under the Credit Facility may, with the consent, or shall, at the request of a majority of the lenders under the Credit Facility, terminate the commitments and declare all of the amounts owed under the Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable. We may prepay amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility without premium or penalty provided that Co-Borrowers compensate the lenders for losses and expenses incurred as a result of the prepayment of any Eurodollar Loan, as defined in the Credit Facility.\nProceeds from borrowings under the Credit Facility may generally be used to finance ongoing working capital requirements, including permitted acquisitions, cash dividends, if and when declared, repurchases of Class A common stock pursuant to stock repurchase programs, in place from time to time, and other general corporate activities. We had $75.0 million outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility at June 30, 2020 with $925.0 million of available borrowing capacity after reductions for outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit. On July 31, 2020, we repaid $25.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility.\nMember-Owner TRA\nPursuant to the TRA, we will pay member owners 85% of the tax savings, if any, in U.S. federal, foreign, state and local income and franchise tax that we actually realize (or are deemed to realize, in the case of payments required to be made upon certain occurrences under the TRA) in connection with the Section 754 election. The election results in adjustments to the tax basis of the assets of Premier LP upon member owner exchanges of Class B common units of Premier LP for Class A common stock of Premier, Inc., cash or a combination of both. Tax savings are generated as a result of the increases in tax basis resulting from the initial sale of Class B common units, subsequent exchanges (pursuant to the Exchange Agreement) and payments under the TRA.\nWe had TRA liabilities of $293.7 million and $344.1 million as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The change in TRA liabilities was driven by $90.1 million attributable to member departures, $24.6 million in TRA remeasurements primarily due to the change in North Carolina state income tax law and $17.5 million in TRA payments during the year ended June 30, 2020. These changes were partially offset by an increase of $81.7 million in connection with the quarterly member owner exchanges that occurred during the year ended June 30, 2020.\nOn August 10, 2020, Premier exercised its right to terminate the TRA by providing all former limited partners a notice of the termination and the amount of the expected payment to be made to each former limited partner pursuant to the early termination provisions of the TRA (each such amount an \"Early Termination Payment\") with a determination date of August 10, 2020. The aggregate amount of the Early Termination Payments is approximately $473.5 million. Of that amount, approximately $10.6 million is payable within three business days after the date the Early Termination Payment becomes final, which is expected to be on or about September 15, 2020, to former limited partners that did not elect to execute Unit Exchange Agreements. Pursuant\nto the Unit Exchange Agreements, the remaining amount payable, approximately $462.9 million in the aggregate, will be paid, without interest, to former limited partners that elected to execute Unit Exchange Agreements in 18 equal quarterly installments commencing during the quarter ending March 31, 2021 and ending in the quarter ending June 30, 2025.\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn May 7, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300.0 million of our outstanding Class A common stock during fiscal year 2020 as a continuation of our balanced capital deployment strategy. During fiscal year 2020, we purchased an aggregate of 4.6 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $32.28 per share for a total purchase price of $150.0 million under our fiscal year 2020 stock repurchase program.

The increase was driven by growth in net administrative fees revenue, an increase in product revenue driven by aggregated purchasing of certain products as a result of COVID-19 and growth in commodity products, an increase in earnings from our 49% equity investment with FFF and a decrease in employee travel and meeting expenses as a result of the elimination of employee travel due to COVID-19. These increases were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses as a result of current year acquisitions as well as the significant impact of COVID-19 to the full year growth of net administrative fees revenue during the three months ended June 30, 2020.\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

The consolidated tax expense of any given year includes adjustments to prior year income tax reserve and related estimated interest charges that are considered appropriate. Our policy is to recognize, when applicable, interest and penalties on uncertain income tax positions as part of income tax expense.\nOther (expense) income, net increased by $22.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to the $22.0 million loss on FFF put and call rights in the prior year and the impairment on investments recorded in the prior year.\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased by $218.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to year ended June 30, 2019. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase of $125.0 million in net borrowings under the Credit Facility, a decrease of $100.0 million in repurchases of Class A common stock under the current year stock repurchase program and a decrease of $8.9 million in distributions to limited partners of Premier LP.

A summary of Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow and reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities for the periods presented follows (in thousands):\nto the Unit Exchange Agreements, the remaining amount payable, approximately $462.9 million in the aggregate, will be paid, without interest, to former limited partners that elected to execute Unit Exchange Agreements in 18 equal quarterly installments commencing during the quarter ending March 31, 2021 and ending in the quarter ending June 30, 2025.\nOn May 7, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300.0 million of our outstanding Class A common stock during fiscal year 2020 as a continuation of our balanced capital deployment strategy. During fiscal year 2020, we purchased an aggregate of 4.6 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $32.28 per share for a total purchase price of $150.0 million under our fiscal year 2020 stock repurchase program. In addition, during the year ended June 30, 2020, no shares of Class B common units were exchanged for cash in connection with quarterly member owner exchanges under the Exchange Agreement.\nTRA\nAcquisition of Medpricer\nWe define Segment Adjusted EBITDA as the segment's net revenue less cost of revenue and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment excluding depreciation and amortization, amortization of purchased intangible assets, merger and acquisition related expenses and non-recurring or non-cash items and including equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates. Operating expenses directly attributable to the segment include expenses associated with sales and marketing, general and administrative, and product development activities specific to the operation of each segment. General and administrative corporate expenses that are not specific to a particular segment are not included in the calculation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment Adjusted EBITDA also excludes any income and expense that has been classified as discontinued operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a Non-GAAP financial measure as defined in \"Our Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\", increased by $3.0 million, or 1%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 driven by an increase of $22.3 million in Supply Chain Services partially offset by decreases of $17.9 million and $1.4 million in Performance Services and Corporate, respectively.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nDuring fiscal year 2019, we purchased an aggregate of 6.7 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $37.38 per share for a total purchase price of $250.0 million under our fiscal year 2019 stock repurchase program.\nNet revenue increased by $32.9 million, or 3%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to an increase of $18.7 million in net administrative fees revenue, an increase of $2.5 million in other services and support revenue and an increase of $11.9 million in product revenue.\nSupply Chain Services\n\nrequests may be implemented in the future. In addition, several pharmacy suppliers have exercised force majeure clauses related to failure to supply clauses in their contracts with us because they are unable to obtain raw materials for manufacturing from India and China. The standard failure to supply language in our contracts contains financial penalties to suppliers if they are unable to supply products, which such suppliers may not be able to pay. In addition, we may not be able to source products from alternative suppliers on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nWe prepare and file tax returns based on interpretations of tax laws and regulations. Our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities in the normal course of business. Such examinations may result in future tax, interest and penalty assessments by these taxing authorities.\nDivestiture of Specialty Pharmacy Business - Discontinued Operations\nWe pay a revenue share equal to a percentage of gross administrative fees, which is estimated according to the members' contractual agreements with us using a portfolio approach based on historical revenue fee share percentages and adjusted for current or anticipated trends. Revenue share is recognized as a reduction to gross administrative fees revenue to arrive at a net administrative fees revenue, and the corresponding revenue share liability is included in revenue share obligations in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSupply Chain Services segment revenue increased by $97.6 million, or 11%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. Supply Chain Services segment revenue increased by $31.2 million, or 4%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018.\nBusiness Overview\n \u2022 Managing the evolving regulatory environment. In response to COVID-19, federal, state and local governments are issuing new rules, regulations, changing reimbursement eligibility rules, orders and advisories on a regular basis. These government actions can impact us and our members and suppliers.  The ultimate impact of COVID-19, recurrences, or similar pandemics on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows is dependent on future developments, including the duration of any pandemic and the related length of its impact on the United States and global economies, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, recurrences, or future similar pandemics may also exacerbate many of the other risks described in this \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" section. Despite our efforts to manage these impacts, their ultimate impact depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of any outbreak and actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects. The foregoing and other continued disruptions in our business as a result of COVID-19 could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, prospects and the trading prices of our securities in the near-term and beyond 2020.\nProduct revenue increased by $11.8 million, or 7%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by growth in commodity products and aggregated purchasing of certain products, partially offset by the $3.1 million impact of revenue recognition under the New Revenue Standard on distributor fees, which were historically recognized on a gross basis under the Previous Revenue Standard but are now recognized on a net basis under the New Revenue Standard.\nAdjusted Fully Distributed Net Income, a Non-GAAP financial measure as defined below in \"Our Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\", is calculated net of taxes based on our fully distributed estimated statutory tax rate for federal and state income tax for us as if we were one consolidated taxable group with all of our subsidiaries' activities included. Prior to the enactment of the TCJA, the tax rate used to compute the Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income was 39%. Effective January 1, 2018, we used a fully distributed tax rate of 26% to compute the Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income.\nCost of revenue consists of cost of service revenue and cost of product revenue.\n (a) Estimated payments due to limited partners under the TRA are based on 85% of the estimated amount of tax savings we expect to receive, generally over a 15-year period. \nCost of Revenue\nWe expect our other services and support revenue to grow over the long-term to the extent we are able to expand our sales to existing members and additional members begin to utilize our integrated platform of products and services.\nOther services and support revenue in our Performance Services segment decreased by $15.6 million, or 4%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower demand in consulting services and a decrease in revenue as a result of the planned reduction and subsequent discontinuance of the Hospital Improvement Innovation Network contract. These decreases were partially offset by growth in technology license contracts as a result of new enterprise license agreements.\nCost of product revenue increased by $71.3 million, or 41%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 and increased by $18.6 million, or 12%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. These increases were both driven by higher costs associated with the aforementioned growth in direct sourcing sales, which during the year ended June 30, 2020 was significantly impacted by COVID-19. We expect our cost of product revenue to increase to the extent we are able to sell additional direct-sourced medical products to new and existing members. Increases in cost of product revenues could reduce our gross profit as a percentage of our net revenues depending on the underlying product sales mix.\nCost of revenue increased $13.6 million, or 4%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to an increase of $18.7 million in cost of product revenue partially offset by a decrease of $5.0 million in cost of services revenue.\nGiven our ownership and capital structure, various effective tax rates are calculated for specific tax items. For example, the deferred tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense (see Note 14 - Stock-Based Compensation) is calculated based on the effective tax rate of PHSI, the legal entity where the majority of stock-based compensation expense is recorded. Our effective tax rate, as discussed in Note 16 - Income Taxes, represents the effective tax rate computed in accordance with GAAP based on total income tax expense (reflected in income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income) of Premier, Inc., PHSI, PSCI and PMLLC divided by consolidated pre-tax income.\nNet cash provided by operating activities attributable to discontinued operations increased by $16.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to payments on liabilities that were outstanding as of June 30, 2019.\n \u2022 Changes in the demand for our products and services. We have experienced and may continue to experience demand uncertainty from both significant increases and decreases in demand as a result of COVID-19. There has been a significant increase in demand for personal protective equipment (\"PPE\"), drugs and other supplies directly related to treating and preventing the spread of COVID-19. However, either voluntarily or due to government orders or advisories, patients, hospitals and other medical facilities have deferred elective procedures and routine medical visits during the crisis, which created a significant decline in the demand for supplies and services not related to COVID-19 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and such lower demand is expected to continue into fiscal 2021. In addition, as a result of our members' focus on managing COVID-19 and its impacts, we have experienced a decrease in demand for our consulting and other performance service engagements. Furthermore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our members' non-acute or non-healthcare facilities, such as education and hospitality businesses, closed, operated on a limited or reduced basis and have delayed re-opening, and, as a result, we may see a material reduction in product sales to those facilities. The extent to which these impacts on demand will continue, and the effect that they will have on our business and operating results, will depend upon future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. \nAcquisition of Health Design Plus, LLC\nWe account for acquisitions of a business using the acquisition method. All the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies and contingent consideration are generally recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related costs are recorded as expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.\nCost of Revenue\nResearch and development expenses consist of employee-related compensation and benefit expenses and third-party consulting fees of technology professionals, net of capitalized labor, incurred to develop our software-related products and services.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets includes the amortization of all identified intangible assets.\nWe sell perpetual and term licenses that include post-contract customer support in the form of maintenance and support services. Pricing varies by application and size of healthcare system. Fees for the initial period include the license fees, implementation fees and the initial bundled maintenance and support services fees. The maintenance fees for the initial period are recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining initial period following implementation. Subsequent renewal maintenance and support services fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractually stated renewal periods. Implementation services are provided to the customer prior to the use of the software and do not involve significant customization or modification. Implementation is generally 250 to 300 days following contract execution before the licensed software products can be fully utilized by the member.\nSee \"Our Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" above for additional information regarding our use of Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow.\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates as well as net operating losses and credit carryforwards, which will be in effect when these differences reverse. We provide a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets when, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nOther Operating Income\nThe success of our Supply Chain Services revenue streams are influenced by our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with suppliers and members, the number of members that utilize our GPO supplier contracts and the volume of their purchases, as well as the impact of changes in the defined allowable reimbursement amounts determined by Medicare, Medicaid and other managed care plans and the number of members that purchase products through our direct sourcing activities and the impact of competitive pricing.\n (e) Additional consideration to be paid pursuant to the Purchase Agreement for the Acurity and Nexera asset acquisition.  Credit Facility\n (a) Reflects income tax expense at our estimated effective income tax rate of 26% of adjusted fully distributed net income before income taxes for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, and 32% of adjusted fully distributed income before income taxes for the year ended June 30, 2018. \nSupply Chain Services\nOn August 5, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.19 per share, payable on September 15, 2020 to stockholders of record on September 1, 2020. We currently expect quarterly dividends to continue to be paid on or about December 15, March 15, June 15, and September 15. However, the actual declaration of any future cash dividends, and the setting of record and payment dates as well as the per share amounts, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors each quarter after consideration of various factors, including our results of operations, financial condition and capital requirements, earnings, general business conditions, restrictions imposed by our current credit facility and any future financing arrangements, legal restrictions on the payment of dividends and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.\ninterest income and expense, realized and unrealized gains or losses on deferred compensation plan assets, gains or losses on the disposal of assets, and any impairment on our held-to-maturity investments.\nPerformance Services revenue consists of SaaS clinical analytics products subscriptions, license fees, performance improvement collaborative and other service subscriptions, professional fees for consulting services, third party administrator fees for our direct to employer initiative and insurance services management fees and commissions from group-sponsored insurance programs.\nResearch and development expenses consist of employee-related compensation and benefit expenses and third-party consulting fees for technology professionals, net of capitalized labor, incurred to develop our software-related products and services. Research and development expenses increased by $1.2 million, or 100%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. Research and development remained flat during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018.\nWe account for a contract with a customer when the contract is committed, the rights of the parties, including payment terms, are identified, the contract has commercial substance and consideration is probable of collection.\nOur most recent annual impairment testing as of April 1, 2020 consisted of a quantitative assessment and did not result in any goodwill impairment charges. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, we performed an interim assessment of goodwill and other long-lived assets of the specialty pharmacy business for impairment following the announcement of our commitment to sell certain assets of the specialty pharmacy business and to wind down and exit the specialty pharmacy business. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations and Exit Activities to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further information.\nIncome tax expense increased by $59.1 million, or 176%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to an increase in deferred tax expense related to deferred tax remeasurement as a result of North Carolina state tax law changes.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA in the Performance Services segment increased by $5.7 million, or 5%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 primarily as a result of increased other services and support revenue and decreased salaries and benefits expenses in the current year due to lower headcount as a result of staffing efficiencies implemented in the prior year, partially offset by incremental expense resulting from the acquisition in the current year and increased bad debt expense.\nAmortization of Purchased Intangible Assets\nWe enter into lease contracts in which we are the lessee, substantially all of which are related to office space leased in various buildings used for general corporate purposes. The terms of these non-cancelable operating leases typically require us to pay rent and a share of operating expenses and real estate taxes, generally with an inflation-based rent increase included. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nTrends in the U.S. healthcare market affect our revenues and costs in the Supply Chain Services and Performance Services segments. The trends we see affecting our current healthcare business include the impact of the implementation of current or future healthcare legislation, particularly the uncertainty regarding the status of the Affordable Care Act, its repeal, replacement or other modification, the enactment of new regulatory and reporting requirements, expansion and contraction of insurance coverage and associated costs that may impact subscriber elections, intense cost pressure, payment reform, provider consolidation, shift in care to the alternate site market and increased data availability and transparency. To meet the demands of this environment, there will be increased focus on scale and cost containment and healthcare providers will need to measure and report on and bear financial risk for outcomes. Over the long-term, we believe these trends will result in increased demand for our Supply Chain Services and Performance Services solutions in the areas of cost management, quality and safety, and value based care, however, there are uncertainties and risks that may affect the actual impact of these anticipated trends, expected demand for our services or related assumptions on our business. See \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" for more information.\nThe variances in the material factors contributing to the changes in consolidated Adjusted EBITDA are discussed further in \"Segment Results\" below.\nThe following table provides certain Non-GAAP financial measures for the fiscal years presented (in thousands, except per share data). Refer to \"Our Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for further information regarding items excluded in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased by $1.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 driven by an increase in technology expenses driven by software subscriptions associated with recent acquisitions partially offset by a decrease in employee travel and meeting expenses as a result of the elimination of employee travel due to COVID-19.\nAs we execute on our growth strategy and further deploy capital, we expect increases in amortization of intangible assets in connection with future potential acquisitions.\nCost of service revenue includes expenses related to employees (including compensation and benefits) and outside consultants who directly provide services related to revenue-generating activities, including consulting services to members and implementation services related to SaaS clinical analytics along with associated amortization of certain capitalized contract costs. Amortization of contract costs represent amounts that have been capitalized and reflect the incremental costs of obtaining and fulfilling a contract. Amortization of contract costs included within cost of service revenue include costs related to implementing SaaS informatics tools. Cost of service revenue also includes expenses related to hosting services, related data center capacity costs, third-party product license expenses and amortization of the cost of internally developed software applications.\n (a) Reflects income tax expense at our estimated effective income tax rate of 26% of adjusted fully distributed net income before income taxes for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, and 32% of adjusted fully distributed income before income taxes for the year ended June 30, 2018. \n\nOur income tax expense is attributable to the activities of Premier, Inc., PHSI, PSCI and Premier Marketplace, LLC (\"PMLLC\"), all of which are subchapter C corporations and are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. In contrast, under the provisions of federal and state laws, Premier LP is not subject to federal and state income taxes as the income realized by Premier LP is taxable to its partners. Our overall effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the ownership structure as well as other items noted in Note 16 - Income Taxes.\nWe expect that certain trends and economic or industry-wide factors will continue to affect our business, both in the short-term and long-term. We have based our expectations described below on assumptions made by us and on information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about, or interpretation of, available information prove to be incorrect our actual\nOur Performance Services segment includes one of the largest informatics and consulting services businesses in the United States focused on healthcare providers. Our software as a service (\"SaaS\") based clinical analytics products and technology licenses utilize our comprehensive data set to provide actionable intelligence to our members, enabling them to benchmark, analyze and identify areas of improvement across three main categories: cost management, quality and safety, and value based care. The Performance Services segment also includes our technology enabled performance improvement collaboratives, consulting services, direct to employer initiative and insurance management services.\nOther operating income of $24.6 million during the year ended June 30, 2020 is attributable to the remeasurement of the TRA liability as a result of the change in North Carolina state income tax law. Other operating income of $177.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2018 represents the remeasurement of TRA liabilities driven by the 14% decrease in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate associated with the TCJA that was enacted on December 22, 2017.\nNet Revenue\nCost of services revenue in our Performance Services segment increased by $5.7 million, or 3%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to increased amortization of internally-developed software applications.\nWe expect cost of service revenue to increase to the extent we continue to develop new and enhance existing internally developed software applications, expand our consulting services and performance improvement collaboratives and expand into new product offerings.\nCosts associated with internally developed computer software that are incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. During the development stage, direct consulting costs and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees that are directly associated with each project are capitalized. Internal use capitalized software costs are included in property and equipment, net in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related software applications of up to five years and amortization is included in cost of revenue or selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, based on the software's end use. Replacements and major improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this process involve determining the stages of the software development project, the direct costs to capitalize and the estimated useful life of the capitalized software.\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations and Adjusted EBITDA in the Performance Services segment for the fiscal years presented (in thousands):\n\nNet administrative fees revenue is a single performance obligation earned through a series of distinct daily services and includes maintaining a network of members to participate in the group purchasing program and providing suppliers efficiency in contracting and access to our members. Revenue is generated through administrative fees received from suppliers and is included in service revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.\nDeferred revenue consists of unrecognized revenue related to advanced customer invoicing or member payments received prior to fulfillment of our revenue recognition criteria. Substantially all deferred revenue consists of deferred subscription fees and deferred consulting fees. Subscription fees for Company-hosted SaaS applications are deferred until the customer's unique data records have been incorporated into the underlying software database, or until customer site-specific software has been implemented and the customer has access to the software. Deferred consulting fees arise upon invoicing to customers prior to services being performed.\nAcquisition related expenses include legal, accounting and other expenses related to acquisition activities and gains and losses on the change in fair value of earn-out liabilities. Disposition related expenses include severance and retention benefits and financial advisor fees and legal fees related to disposition activities.\nThe following table provides the reconciliation of net income from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation of income before income taxes to Segment Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands). Refer to \"Our Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for further information regarding items excluded in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA.\nOn August 10, 2020, Premier exercised its right to terminate the TRA by providing all former limited partners a notice of the termination and the amount of the expected payment to be made to each former limited partner pursuant to the early termination provisions of the TRA (each such amount an \"Early Termination Payment\") with a determination date of August 10, 2020. The aggregate amount of the Early Termination Payments is approximately $473.5 million. Of that amount, approximately $10.6 million is payable within three business days after the date the Early Termination Payment becomes final, which is expected to be on or about September 15, 2020, to former limited partners that did not elect to execute Unit Exchange Agreements. Pursuant\nOther income (expense), net, includes equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates that is generated from our equity method investments. Our equity method investments primarily consist of our 49% ownership in FFF Enterprises, Inc. (\"FFF\"). Other income (expense), net, also includes the change in fair value of our FFF put and call rights (see Note 6 - Fair Value Measurements),\nCost of Revenue\nIncome Taxes\nWe only include estimated amounts of consideration in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. These estimates require management to make complex, difficult or subjective judgments, and to make estimates about the effect of matters\nNet revenue increased by $82.0 million, or 7%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to an increase of $85.7 million in product revenue and an increase of $8.1 million in net administrative fees revenue. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $11.9 million in other services and support revenue.\nWe record TRA liabilities based on 85% of the estimated amount of tax savings we expect to receive, generally over a 15-year period, which are attributable to the initial purchase of Class B common units from the member owners made concurrently with the IPO and subsequent exchanges by member owners of Class B common units into Class A common stock or cash. Tax payments made under the TRA will be made to the member owners as we realize tax benefits. Determining the estimated amount of tax savings we expect to receive requires judgment as deductibility of goodwill amortization expense is not assured and the estimate of tax savings is dependent upon the actual realization of the tax benefit and the tax rates in effect at that time.\nNet revenue consists of service revenue, which includes net administrative fees revenue and other services and support revenue, and product revenue. Net administrative fees revenue consists of GPO administrative fees in our Supply Chain Services segment. Other services and support revenue consists primarily of fees generated by our Performance Services segment in connection with our SaaS and licensed-based clinical analytics products subscriptions, license fees, third party administrator fees and consulting services and performance improvement collaborative subscriptions. Product revenue consists of direct sourcing product sales, which are included in the Supply Chain Services segment.\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations and Adjusted EBITDA, a Non-GAAP financial measure, in the Supply Chain Services segment for the fiscal years presented (in thousands):\nChanges in estimated TRA liabilities that are the result of a change in tax accounting method, including the impacts of the TCJA, are recorded as a component of other operating income or selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Changes in estimated TRA liabilities that are related to new basis changes as a result of the exchange of Class B common units for a like number of shares of Class A common stock or as a result of departed member owners are recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity (Deficit).\nDiscussion of Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow for the Years Ended June 30, 2020 and 2019\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion is designed to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles affect our consolidated financial statements. In addition, the following discussion includes certain forward-looking statements. For a discussion of important factors, including the continuing development of our business and other factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results referred to in the forward-looking statements, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" and \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" contained in this Annual Report. Unless otherwise indicated, information in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect continuing operations for all periods presented. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations and Exit Activities to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further information.\nOperating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term beginning at the commencement date. Operating lease right-of-use assets are adjusted for lease incentives, deferred rent and initial direct costs, if incurred. Our leases generally do not include an implicit rate; therefore, we determined the present value of future minimum lease payments using an incremental borrowing rate based on information available as of July 1, 2019, the transition date. The related lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nOther Operating Income\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $172.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was driven by the prepaid contract administrative fee share of $93.8 million for one-time rebates paid by Acurity, Inc. to certain of its then members, as agreed to by Acurity, Inc. prior to entering into the Purchase Agreement. These payments were excluded from the purchase price of the Acurity and Nexera asset acquisition. As of June 30, 2020, we had capitalized $87.3 million on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized $6.5 million to net revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. In addition, the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to a decrease in our working capital primarily driven by the impact of the aggregated purchasing of personal protective equipment as a result of COVID-19, an increase in acquisition and disposition related expenses associated with certain strategic initiatives and lower profitability in our Performance Services segment. These decreases were partially offset by growth in net administrative fees revenue in our Supply Chain Services segment and the remeasurement of the TRA in the current period.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $16.7 million, or 15%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 primarily driven by increased amortization of internally developed software applications, expenses associated with acquisitions and higher bad debt expense primarily due to a hospital bankruptcy.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nAs of June 30, 2020 and 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $99.3 million and $141.1 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, there was $75.0 million and $25.0 million, respectively, of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. During the year ended June 30, 2020, we borrowed $400.0 million and repaid $350.0 million of borrowings under the Credit Facility, which was used to fund acquisitions during the current year, share repurchases under the fiscal 2020 stock repurchase program, and for other general corporate activities. On July 31, 2020, we repaid $25.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility.\n (c) Future contractual obligations for leases represent future minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases primarily for office space. \nOther operating income of $24.6 million during the year ended June 30, 2020 is attributable to the remeasurement of the TRA liability as a result of the change in North Carolina state income tax law. Other operating income of $177.2 million during the year ended June 30, 2018 is attributable to the remeasurement of TRA liabilities driven by the 14% decrease in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate associated with the TCJA that was enacted on December 22, 2017.\nAs we execute on our growth strategy and further deploy capital, we expect increases in amortization of intangible assets in connection with future potential acquisitions.\nNon-recurring and non-cash items excluded in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income consist of stock-based compensation, acquisition and disposition related expenses, remeasurement of TRA liabilities, loss on disposal of long-lived assets, gain or loss on FFF put and call rights, income and expense that has been classified as discontinued operations and other expense. More information about certain of the more significant items follows below.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe following table provides the reconciliation of earnings (loss) per share attributable to stockholders to Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share for the periods presented. Refer to \"Our Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for further information regarding items excluded in our calculation of Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share.\nnm = not meaningful\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA in the Supply Chain Services segment increased by $16.2 million, or 3%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. The increase was primarily a result of growth in net administrative fees revenue and growth in service fees from our academic initiative, partially offset by a decline in gross margin associated with product revenue.\nAs further described in Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies, we adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (\"New Lease Standard\") effective July 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. The modified retrospective approach resulted in recognizing the cumulative effect of initially applying the New Lease Standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of equity at July 1, 2019. Therefore, the comparative information is presented in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 840 (\"Previous Lease Standard\").\n \u2022 Materials and personnel shortages and disruptions in supply chain, including manufacturing and shipping. The global supply chain has been significantly disrupted due to stay at home orders, border closings and rapidly escalating shipping costs. Borders closings and restrictions in response to COVID-19, particularly regarding China and India, have impacted our access to products for our members. Staffing or personnel shortages due to shelter in place orders and quarantines have impacted and in the future may impact us and our members or suppliers. In addition, due to unprecedented demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, there are widespread shortages in certain product categories. In the food service line, COVID-19 related illnesses have impacted food processing suppliers and led to plant closures. If the supply chain for materials used in the products purchased by our members through our GPO or products contract manufactured through our direct sourcing business is adversely impacted by restrictions resulting from COVID-19, our supply chain may be disrupted. Failure of our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors and other business partners to meet their obligations to our members or to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so due to their own financial or operational difficulties, may adversely impact our operations. \nNew accounting standards that we have recently adopted as well as those that have been recently issued but not yet adopted by us are included in Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nWe define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less distributions and TRA payments to limited partners and purchases of property and equipment. Free Cash Flow does not represent discretionary cash available for spending as it excludes certain contractual obligations such as debt repayments.\nSoftware Development Costs\nDeferred Revenue\nAcquisition and disposition related expenses\nLeases\n\nresults may vary materially from our expected results. See \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" and \"Risk Factors.\"\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $1.2 million during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. Expenses decreased due to the impact of the New Revenue Standard on distributor fees associated with direct sourcing revenue and due to decreased general overhead expenses in the current year. These decreases were offset by increased expenses associated with our strategic initiatives.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $20.9 million, or 5%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $13.7 million, or 3%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. The variances in the material factors contributing to the changes in consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses are discussed further in \"Segment Results\" below.\n \u2022 Our GPO member hospitals and non-acute care sites have experienced reduced or limited access for non-patients, including our field teams, consultants and other professionals, and travel restrictions have impacted our employees' ability to travel to our members' facilities. \n \u2022 We have experienced and may continue to experience demand uncertainty from both significant increases in demand for PPE, drugs and other products related to the treatment of COVID-19 and decreases in demand for non-COVID-19 related products. \ntaxes at our estimated effective income tax rate. We define Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share as Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income divided by diluted weighted average shares (see Note 13 - Earnings (Loss) Per Share).\n \u2022 In response to COVID-19, federal, state and local governments are issuing new rules, regulations, changing reimbursement eligibility rules, orders and advisories on a regular basis. These government actions can impact us and our members and suppliers.  Discussion of Cash Flows for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019\nLLC (\"Contigo Health\") and is reported as part of the Performance Services segment. See Note 3 - Business Acquisitions to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further information.\nall of our Class B common stock was held beneficially by our member owners and all of our Class A common stock was held by public investors, which may include member owners that have received shares of our Class A common stock in connection with previous quarterly exchanges pursuant to an exchange agreement (the \"Exchange Agreement\") (see Note 1 - Organization and Basis of Presentation to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for more information). On August 11, 2020, we executed a corporate restructuring as described in \"Item 1. Business\" under \"Recent Restructuring\" and in Note 21 - Subsequent Events to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements.\nAlthough we believe that our approach in developing estimates and reliance on certain judgments and underlying inputs is reasonable, actual results could differ which may result in exposure of increases or decreases in revenue that could be material.\nPremier, Inc. (\"Premier\", the \"Company\", \"we\", or \"our\") is a leading healthcare improvement company, uniting an alliance of more than 4,100 U.S. hospitals and health systems and approximately 200,000 other providers and organizations to transform healthcare. We partner with hospitals, health systems, physicians and other healthcare providers with the common goal of improving and innovating in the clinical, financial and operational areas of their businesses to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving healthcare industry. We deliver value through a comprehensive technology-enabled platform that offers critical supply chain services, clinical, financial, operational and value based care software-as-a-service (\"SaaS\") and licensed-based clinical analytics products, consulting services and performance improvement collaborative programs.\nInsurance services management fees are recognized in the period in which such services are provided. Commissions from group sponsored insurance programs are earned by acting as an intermediary in the placement of effective insurance policies. Under this arrangement, revenue is recognized at a point in time on the effective date of the associated policies when control of the policy transfers to the customer and is constrained for estimated early terminations.\n\nAs of June 30, 2020, we owned a 59% controlling general partner interest in Premier LP through Premier GP. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest represents the portion of net income attributable to the limited partners of Premier LP, which was 41% and 51% as of June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively (see Note 11 - Redeemable Limited Partners' Capital).\nChanges in estimated TRA liabilities that are the result of a change in tax accounting method are recorded in remeasurement of tax receivable agreement liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Changes in estimated TRA liabilities that are related to new basis changes as a result of the exchange of Class B common units for a like number of shares of Class A common stock or as a result of departed member owners are recorded as an increase or decrease to additional paid-in capital in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity (Deficit).\nOperating Expenses\nOther Services and Support Revenue\nThe variances in the material factors contributing to the changes in consolidated operating expense are discussed further in \"Segment Results\" below.\nThe Credit Facility also contains customary events of default including, among others, payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults of any indebtedness or guarantees in excess of $75.0 million, bankruptcy and other insolvency events, ERISA-related liabilities and judgment defaults in excess of $50.0 million, and the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the Credit Facility). If any event of default occurs and is continuing, the administrative agent under the Credit Facility may, with the consent, or shall, at the request of a majority of the lenders under the Credit Facility, terminate the commitments and declare all of the amounts owed under the Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable. We may prepay amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility without premium or penalty provided that Co-Borrowers compensate the lenders for losses and expenses incurred as a result of the prepayment of any Eurodollar Loan, as defined in the Credit Facility.\nNet Revenue\n \u2022 We have and may continue to receive requests for contract modifications, payment waivers and deferrals, payment reductions or amended payment terms from our contract counterparties. In addition, several pharmacy suppliers have exercised force majeure clauses related to failure to supply clauses in their contracts with us. \nOther services and support revenue in our Performance Services segment increased by $1.8 million during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. The increase was driven by growth in applied sciences and cost management consulting services, as revenue is now recognized proportionally to when services are provided under the New Revenue Standard whereas revenue recognition was deferred in certain circumstances until certain performance conditions were met under the Previous Revenue Standard, as well as revenue from acquisitions, which contributed $3.7 million in growth. These increases were offset by the impact of revenue that was historically recognized on a gross basis under the Previous Revenue Standard but was recognized on a net basis under the New Revenue Standard and a decrease related to the timing of certain contracts ending in the cost management and quality and safety businesses.\nAcquisition of Acurity and Nexera Assets\nWithin Performance Services, which provides technology with wrap-around service offerings, revenue consists of SaaS clinical analytics products subscriptions, perpetual and term licenses, performance improvement collaboratives and other service subscriptions, professional fees for consulting services, third-party administrator fees for the direct to employer initiative and insurance services management fees and commissions from group-sponsored insurance programs.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets decreased by $3.2 million, or 9%, to $32.6 million during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019, and remained relatively flat during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018.\nNet Revenue\nOperating Expenses\nPursuant to the TRA, we will pay member owners 85% of the tax savings, if any, in U.S. federal, foreign, state and local income and franchise tax that we actually realize (or are deemed to realize, in the case of payments required to be made upon certain occurrences under the TRA) in connection with the Section 754 election. The election results in adjustments to the tax basis of the assets of Premier LP upon member owner exchanges of Class B common units of Premier LP for Class A common stock of Premier, Inc., cash or a combination of both. Tax savings are generated as a result of the increases in tax basis resulting from the initial sale of Class B common units, subsequent exchanges (pursuant to the Exchange Agreement) and payments under the TRA.\ninherently uncertain. As such, we may not be able to reliably estimate variable fees based on performance in certain long-term arrangements due to uncertainties that are not expected to be resolved for a long period of time or when our experience with similar types of contracts is limited. Estimates of variable consideration and the determination of whether to include estimated amounts of consideration in the transaction price are based on information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction and the specific facts and circumstances of each arrangement. Additionally, management performs periodic analyses to verify the accuracy of estimates for variable consideration.\nSaaS clinical analytics subscriptions include the right to use our proprietary hosted technology on a SaaS basis, training and member support to deliver improvements in cost management, quality and safety, value-based care and provider analytics. SaaS arrangements create a single performance obligation for each subscription within the contract in which the nature of the obligation is a stand-ready obligation, and each day of service meets the criteria for over time recognition. Pricing varies by application and size of healthcare system. Clinical analytics subscriptions are generally three- to five-year agreements with automatic renewal clauses and annual price escalators that typically do not allow for early termination. These agreements do not allow for physical possession of the software. Subscription fees are typically billed on a monthly basis and revenue is recognized as a single deliverable on a\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest decreased by $13.2 million, or 8%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to a decrease in non-controlling ownership interest percentage in Premier LP to 41% from 51%.\nPerformance Obligations\nWe, through our GPO programs, aggregate member purchasing power to negotiate pricing discounts and improve contract terms with suppliers. Contracted suppliers pay us administrative fees which generally represent 1% to 3% of the purchase price of goods and services sold to members under the contracts we have negotiated. Administrative fees are variable consideration and are recognized as earned based upon estimated purchases by our members utilizing analytics based on historical member spend and updates for current trends and expectations. Administrative fees are estimated due to the difference in timing of when a member purchases on a supplier contract and when we receive the purchasing information. Member and supplier contracts substantiate persuasive evidence of an arrangement. We do not take title to the underlying equipment or products purchased by members through our GPO supplier contracts. Administrative fee revenue receivable is included in contract assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCost of services revenue remained flat during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. Cost of services revenue decreased by $4.6 million, or 95%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to the impact of revenue recognition under the New Revenue Standard on the recognition of costs associated with our partnership with a third party to provide pharmacy benefit management services,\nIn addition to the trends in the U.S. healthcare market discussed above, we face known and unknown uncertainties arising from the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") and the resulting global pandemic and financial and operational uncertainty, including its impact on the overall economy, our sales, operations and supply chains, our members, workforce and suppliers, and countries. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and potential future pandemic outbreaks, we face significant risks including, but not limited to:\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA, Segment Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income and Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA assist our Board of Directors, management and investors in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period because they remove the impact of earnings elements attributable to our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization), certain items outside the control of our management team, e.g. taxes, other non-cash items (such as impairment of intangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments and stock-based compensation), non-recurring items (such as strategic and financial restructuring expenses) and income and expense that has been classified as discontinued operations from our operating results. We believe Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income and Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share assist our Board of Directors, management and investors in comparing our net income and earnings per share on a consistent basis from period to period because these measures remove non-cash (such as impairment of intangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments and stock-based compensation), non-recurring items (such as strategic and financial restructuring expenses), and eliminate the variability of non-controlling interest that results from member owner exchanges of Class B common units for shares of Class A common stock. We believe Free Cash Flow is an important measure because it represents the cash that we generate after payment of tax distributions to limited partners and capital investment to maintain existing products and services and ongoing business operations, as well as development of new and upgraded products and services to support future growth. Our Free Cash Flow allows us to enhance stockholder value through acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures, investments in related businesses and debt reduction.\n\nSome of the limitations of the Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income and Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share measures are that they do not reflect income tax expense or income tax payments we are required to make. In addition, Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income and Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share are not measures of profitability under GAAP.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nRevenue Recognition\nAdjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are supplemental financial measures used by us and by external users of our financial statements and are considered to be indicators of the operational strength and performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow measures allow us to assess our performance without regard to financing methods and capital structure and without the impact of other matters that we do not consider indicative of the operating performance of our business. More specifically, Segment Adjusted EBITDA is the primary earnings measure we use to evaluate the performance of our business segments.\nOperating expenses decreased by $1.2 million, or 1%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to a decrease of $1.2 million in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nA performance obligation is a promise to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Contracts may have a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer individual goods or services is not separately identifiable from other promises, and therefore, not distinct, while other contracts may have multiple performance obligations, most commonly due to the contract covering multiple deliverable arrangements (licensing fees, implementation fees, subscription fees, professional fees for consulting services, etc.).\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $1.8 million, or 1%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018, primarily driven by decreased salaries and benefits and travel expenses, partially offset by increased depreciation of purchased software and hardware.\nThe following table presents our results of operations for the fiscal years presented (in thousands, except per share data):\nAmortization of Purchased Intangible Assets\nRevenue from performance improvement collaboratives and other service subscriptions that support our offerings in cost management, quality and safety, and value-based care is recognized over the service period as the services are provided, which is generally one year. Performance improvement collaboratives and other services subscriptions revenue is considered one performance obligation and is generated by providing customers access to online communities whereby data is housed and available for analytics and benchmarking.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $93.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase of $70.8 million in cash paid for business acquisitions in the current year compared to cash paid for business acquisitions in the prior year. This increase was partially offset by lower proceeds received during the current year of $19.1 million due to the liquidation of property and equipment in connection with our exit from specialty pharmacy operations in June 2019.\nProduct Revenue\nMember-Owner TRA\nstraight-line basis over the remaining contractual period following implementation. Implementation involves the completion of data preparation services that are unique to each member's data set and, in certain cases, the installation of member site-specific software, in order to access and transfer member data into our hosted SaaS clinical analytics products. Implementation is generally 60 to 240 days following contract execution before the SaaS clinical analytics products can be fully utilized by the member.\nCost of product revenue consists of purchase and shipment costs for direct sourced medical products. Our cost of product revenue is influenced by the manufacturing and transportation costs associated with direct sourced medical products.\nNew Accounting Standards\nCorporate\nIncome (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax\nAdjusted EBITDA\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax was $1.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to the substantial completion of the wind down of the specialty pharmacy business.\nSegment Results\n \u2022 The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in a prolonged recession or depression in the United States or globally that could harm the banking system, limit demand for all products and services and cause other seen and unforeseen events and circumstances, all of which could negatively impact us. \nContractual Obligations\nincremental or overall purchasing volume that could, if materially increased, adversely impact our revenues and overall financial performance.\nIncome tax expense decreased by $226.0 million, or 87%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. The decrease was largely driven by the tax expenses recorded in fiscal year 2018 associated with the remeasurement of deferred tax balances related to the reduction in the statutory rate from 35% to 21% as a result of the TCJA. See Note 16 - Income Taxes for more information.\nTotal capitalized labor and research and development expenditures decreased by $1.7 million to $79.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2020. Total capitalized labor and research and development expenditures increased by $4.3 million to $80.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. We experience fluctuations in our research and development expenditures across reportable periods due to the timing of our software development lifecycles, new product features and functionality, new technologies and upgrades to our service offerings.\nConsulting arrangements can require significant estimates for the transaction price and estimated number of hours within an engagement. These estimates are based on the expected value which is derived from outcomes from historical contracts that are similar in nature and forecasted amounts based on anticipated savings for the new agreements. The transaction price is generally constrained until the target transaction price becomes more certain.\n (b) On August 10, 2020, Premier exercised its right to terminate the TRA providing all former limited partners a notice of the termination and the amount of the expected payment to be made to each former limited partner pursuant to the early termination provisions of the TRA (each such amount an \"Early Termination Payment\") with a determination date of August 10, 2020. The aggregate amount of the Early Termination Payments is approximately $473.5 million. Of that amount, approximately $10.6 million is payable within three business days after the date the Early Termination Payment becomes final, which is expected to be on or about September 15, 2020, to former limited partners that did not elect to execute Unit Exchange Agreements. Pursuant to the Unit Exchange Agreements, the remaining amount payable, approximately $462.9 million in the aggregate, will be paid, without interest, to former limited partners that elected to execute Unit Exchange Agreements in 18 equal quarterly installments commencing during the quarter ended March 31, 2021 and ending in the quarter ending June 30, 2025. \nWe met the criteria for classifying certain assets and liabilities of the specialty pharmacy business as a discontinued operation as of June 30, 2019. Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated, information in this Annual Report has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect continuing operations for all periods presented. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations and Exit Activities to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further information.\nWe define Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income as net income attributable to Premier (i) excluding income or loss from discontinued operations, net, (ii) excluding income tax expense, (iii) excluding the impact of adjustment of redeemable limited partners' capital to redemption amount, (iv) excluding the effect of non-recurring and non-cash items, (v) assuming the exchange of all the Class B common units for shares of Class A common stock, which results in the elimination of non-controlling interest in Premier LP and (vi) reflecting an adjustment for income tax expense on adjusted fully distributed net income before income\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nNet Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interest\n (d) Notes payable are non-interest bearing and represent an aggregate principal amount of $9.2 million owed to departed member owners, generally payable over five years from the respective departure dates. \nMultiple Deliverable Arrangements\nWe generated net revenue, net income from continuing operations and Adjusted EBITDA (a financial measure not determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"Non-GAAP\")) for the periods presented as follows (in thousands):\nIncome Tax Expense\n\nBelow is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. These and other significant accounting policies are set forth under Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for nore information.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $9.6 million, or 7%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 driven by increased expenses associated with acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in employee travel and meeting expenses as a result of the elimination of employee travel due to COVID-19.\nOur Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nProfessional fees for consulting services are sold under contracts, the terms of which vary based on the nature of the engagement. These services typically include general consulting, report-based consulting and cost savings initiatives. Promised services under such consulting engagements are typically not considered distinct and are regularly combined and accounted for as one performance obligation. Fees are billed as stipulated in the contract, and revenue is recognized on a proportional performance method as services are performed or when deliverables are provided. In situations where the contracts have significant contract performance guarantees, the performance guarantees are estimated and accounted for as a form of variable consideration when determining the transaction price. In the event that guaranteed savings levels are not achieved, we may have to perform additional services at no additional charge in order to achieve the guaranteed savings or pay the difference between the savings that were guaranteed and the actual achieved savings. Occasionally, our entitlement to consideration is predicated on the occurrence of an event such as the delivery of a report for which client acceptance is required. However, except for event-driven point-in-time transactions, the majority of services provided within this service line are delivered over time due to the continuous benefit provided to our customers.\nThird party administrator fees for our direct to employer initiative consist of integrated fees for the processing of self-insured health care plan claims. Third party administrator fees are invoiced to customers on a monthly basis and typically collected in that period. Revenue is recognized in the period in which the services have been provided.\nOur Supply Chain Services segment includes one of the largest healthcare group purchasing organization programs (\"GPO\") in the United States, serving acute, non-acute, non-healthcare and alternate sites, supply chain co-management and our direct sourcing activities. We generate revenue in our Supply Chain Services segment from administrative fees received from suppliers based on the total dollar volume of supplies purchased by our members, fees from supply chain co-management and through product sales in connection with our direct sourcing activities.\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nStock-based compensation\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses increased by $14.0 million, or 3%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to driven by an increase of $13.7 million in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nPerformance Services\nStock Repurchase Program\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax represents the net income or loss associated with the sale of certain assets and wind down and exit of the specialty pharmacy business. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations and Exit Activities for further information.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets increased by $2.2 million, or 4%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. Amortization of purchased intangible assets remained flat during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. The variances in the material factors contributing to the changes in consolidated amortization of purchased intangible assets are discussed further in \"Segment Results\" below.\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax was $50.6 million for year ended June 30, 2019 and primarily included the $80.4 million non-cash impairment charge related to an interim assessment of goodwill and other long-lived assets of the specialty pharmacy business that were not sold or did not have an alternative use for impairment. In addition, the loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased due to less revenue generated from the specialty pharmacy business during the current year due to the wind down of the business that was initiated on June 7, 2019. These increases were partially offset by the cash proceeds received from the sale. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations and Exit Activities for more information.\nSeveral valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we typically use the income method. This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows for each asset. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset's life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory or economic barriers to entry. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives.\nWe anticipate lower net administrative fees in fiscal year 2021 due to the amendment and extension of GPO participation agreements and the ongoing impact from COVID-19. However, once the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided and we move into fiscal year 2022, we expect our net administrative fees revenue to grow to the extent our existing members increase the utilization of our contracts and additional members convert to our contract portfolio. Due to competitive market trends, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, requests, at times, to provide existing and prospective members increases in revenue share on\nOther Operating Income\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by $21.5 million, or 4%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 driven by increases of $16.2 million and $5.7 million in Supply Chain Services and Performance Services, respectively, partially offset by a decrease of $0.4 million in Corporate.\nThe following table summarizes corporate expenses and Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal years presented (in thousands):\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nA goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis as well as market-based approaches. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analyses are based on the most recent budget and long-term forecast. The discount rates used in the discounted cash flow analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units. The market comparable approach estimates fair value using market multiples of various financial measures compared to a set of comparable public companies and recent comparable transactions.\nWe define EBITDA as net income before income or loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, interest and investment income, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and amortization of purchased intangible assets. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before merger and acquisition related expenses and non-recurring, non-cash or non-operating items and including equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates. For all Non-GAAP financial measures, we consider non-recurring items to be income or expenses and other items that have not been earned or incurred within the prior two years and are not expected to recur within the next two years. Such items include certain strategic and financial restructuring expenses. Non-operating items include gains or losses on the disposal of assets and interest and investment income or expense.\nPerformance Services\nNet Administrative Fees Revenue\nOur Business Segments\nOur principal source of cash has historically been cash provided by operating activities. From time to time we have used, and expect to use in the future, borrowings under our Credit Facility as a source of liquidity. Our primary cash requirements involve operating expenses, working capital fluctuations, revenue share obligations, tax payments, capital expenditures, dividend payments on our Class A common stock, if and when declared, repurchases of Class A common stock pursuant to stock repurchase programs in place from time to time, acquisitions and related business investments, and other general corporate activities. Our capital expenditures typically consist of internally developed software costs, software purchases and computer hardware purchases.\nSee Note 6 - Fair Value Measurements.\nDirect sourcing generates revenue through products sold to distributors, hospitals and other customers. Revenue is recognized once control of products has been transferred to the customer and is recorded net of discounts and rebates offered to customers. Discounts and rebates are estimated based on contractual terms and historical trends.\nOther services and support revenue increased by $3.7 million, or 43%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due supply chain co-management fees as a result of the asset acquisition of Nexera as well as continued growth in our strategic initiatives.\nOn November 9, 2018, we acquired 100% of the outstanding capital stock in Stanson Health, Inc. (\"Stanson\") for an adjusted purchase price of $55.4 million, giving effect to certain purchase price adjustments provided for in the purchase agreement. Stanson is a SaaS-based provider of clinical decision support tools that are integrated directly into the electronic health record workflow, to help provide real-time, patient-specific best practices at the point of care. Stanson is reported as part of the Performance Services segment. See Note 3 - Business Acquisitions to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further information.\nThe Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among others, limitations on liens, indebtedness, fundamental changes, dispositions, restricted payments and investments. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, Premier GP's consolidated total net leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) may not exceed 3.75 to 1.00 for four consecutive quarters, provided that, in connection with any acquisition for which the aggregate consideration exceeds $250.0 million, the maximum consolidated total net leverage ratio may increase to 4.25 to 1.00 for the four consecutive fiscal quarters beginning with the quarter in which such acquisition is completed. In addition, Premier GP must maintain a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) of 2.50 to 1.00 at the end of every fiscal quarter. Premier GP was in compliance with all such covenants at June 30, 2020.\nThe other key business metrics we consider are EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Segment Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income, Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share and Free Cash Flow, which are all Non-GAAP financial measures.\n \u2022 The global supply chain has been significantly disrupted due to stay at home orders, border closings and rapidly escalating shipping costs. \nAmortization of Purchased Intangible Assets\nDespite the importance of these Non-GAAP financial measures in analyzing our business, determining compliance with certain financial covenants in our Credit Facility, measuring and determining incentive compensation and evaluating our operating performance relative to our competitors, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Segment Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income, Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share and Free Cash Flow are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, may have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, net income, net cash provided by operating activities, or any other measure of our performance derived in accordance with GAAP.\nThe adjustment to TRA liabilities for the year ended June 30, 2020 is primarily attributable to increases in the Premier, Inc. effective tax rate related to state tax liabilities (see Note 16 - Income Taxes). The adjustment to TRA liabilities for the year ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to the 14% decrease in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, which occurred as a result of the TCJA that was enacted on December 22, 2017.\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nSelling, general and administrative expenses are directly associated with selling and administrative functions and support of revenue-generating activities including expenses to support and maintain our software-related products and services. Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation and benefits related costs, travel-related expenses, business development expenses, including costs for business acquisition opportunities, business disposition related expenses, indirect costs such as insurance, professional fees and other general overhead expenses, and amortization of certain contract costs. Amortization of contract costs represent amounts that have been capitalized and reflect the incremental costs of obtaining and fulfilling a contract. Amortization of contract costs included within selling, general and administrative expenses include sales commissions.\nProduct Revenue\nAcquisition of Stanson\nNet Revenue\nguaranty of all obligations under the Credit Facility by Premier GP, certain domestic subsidiaries of Premier GP and future guarantors, if any. Premier, Inc. is not a guarantor under the Credit Facility.\nOther services and support revenue increased by $0.7 million, or 10%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. Growth in service fees from our strategic initiatives of $5.4 million was offset by the impact of revenue recognition under the New Revenue Standard related to our partnership with a third party to provide pharmacy benefit management services.\nPremier LP, along with its consolidated subsidiaries, PSCI and PHSI, as Co-Borrowers, Premier GP and certain domestic subsidiaries of Premier GP, as guarantors, entered into an unsecured Credit Facility, dated as of November 9, 2018. The Credit Facility has a maturity date of November 9, 2023, subject to up to two one-year extensions at the request of the Co-Borrowers and approval of a majority of the lenders under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility provides for borrowings of up to $1.0 billion with (i) a $50.0 million sub-facility for standby letters of credit and (ii) a $100.0 million sub-facility for swingline loans. The Credit Facility also provides that Co-Borrowers may from time to time (i) incur incremental term loans and (ii) request an increase in the revolving commitments under the Credit Facility, together up to an aggregate of $350.0 million, subject to the approval of the lenders providing such term loans or revolving commitment increase. The Credit Facility includes an unconditional and irrevocable\nOn February 28, 2020, we, through two newly formed consolidated subsidiaries, Prince A Purchaser, LLC (\"PAP\") and Prince N Purchaser, LLC (\"PNP\"), acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Acurity, Inc. and Nexera, Inc., both indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Greater New York Hospital Association (\"GNYHA\"), for an aggregate amount of $291.5 million, of which $166.1 million was paid at closing with borrowings under our Credit Facility. Pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement (as amended, the \"Purchase Agreement\"), an additional $120.0 million will be paid to the sellers in four equal annual installments of $30.0 million on or about June 30, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024. An additional $5.4 million is expected to be paid during our first fiscal quarter of 2021. In addition to the aggregate amount of $291.5 million, the Purchase Agreement provides a graduated earn-out opportunity to Acurity, Inc. of up to $30.0 million based upon our achievement of a range of member renewals on terms to be agreed to by us and GNYHA based on prevailing market conditions in December 2023.\n (b) Reflects impact of dilutive shares, primarily attributable to the assumed conversion of all Class B common units for Class A common stock.  Consolidated Results - Comparison of the Years Ended June 30, 2020 to 2019 and June 30, 2019 to 2018\nWe had TRA liabilities of $293.7 million and $344.1 million as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The change in TRA liabilities was driven by $90.1 million attributable to member departures, $24.6 million in TRA remeasurements primarily due to the change in North Carolina state income tax law and $17.5 million in TRA payments during the year ended June 30, 2020. These changes were partially offset by an increase of $81.7 million in connection with the quarterly member owner exchanges that occurred during the year ended June 30, 2020.\nOther operating income includes the adjustment to TRA liabilities. Changes in estimated TRA liabilities that are the result of a change in tax accounting method, including the impacts of the TCJA, are recorded as a component of other operating income in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Changes in estimated TRA liabilities that are related to new basis changes as a result of the exchange of Class B common units for a like number of shares of Class A common stock or as a result of departed member owners are recorded as an increase or decrease to additional paid-in capital in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity (Deficit). See \"Income Tax Expense\" below for additional information.\nAfter the closing of the transaction, we changed the names of PAP and PNP to Acurity, LLC (\"Acurity\") and Nexera, LLC (\"Nexera\"), respectively. Acurity is a regional group purchasing organization and has been a customer and strategic partner of ours for more than 24 years. Nexera is a hospital financial improvement consulting firm which partners with healthcare organizations to improve hospital and health system performance, with a significant focus on supply chain enhancement and transformation. We report the operations of Acurity and Nexera as part of the Supply Chain Services segment. See Note 3 - Business Acquisitions to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further information.\nOn May 4, 2020, we, through our consolidated subsidiary Premier Healthcare Solutions, Inc. (\"PHSI\"), acquired 97% of the equity of Health Design Plus, LLC (\"HDP\") for an adjusted purchase price of $24.0 million, giving effect to certain purchase price adjustments provided for in the purchase agreement. The transaction was funded with borrowings under our Credit Facility (as defined in Note 10 - Debt to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements). HDP is a third-party administrator and arranges care for employees through its Centers of Excellence program. Shortly after closing, HDP was renamed Contigo Health,\n (a) Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations excludes the impact of the prepaid administrative fee share for one-time rebates paid by Acurity, Inc. to certain of its then members, as agreed to by Acurity, Inc. prior to entering into the Purchase Agreement and the net change in the aforementioned prepaid administrative fee share capitalized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2020.  Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow decreased by $76.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to a decrease of $84.8 million in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations driven by prepayments for commodity products in response to increased demand due to COVID-19, partially offset by a decrease of $8.9 million in distributions to limited partners of Premier LP.\nMarket and Industry Trends and Outlook\n \u2022 Overall economic and capital markets decline. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in a prolonged recession or depression in the United States or globally that could harm the banking system, limit demand for all products and services and cause other seen and unforeseen events and circumstances, all of which could negatively impact us. The continued spread of COVID-19 has led to and could continue to lead to severe disruption and volatility in the United States and global capital markets, which could increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets in the future. In addition, trading prices on the public stock market, including our Class A common stock, have been highly volatile as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nNet administrative fees revenue increased $8.1 million, or 1%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. Growth in net administrative fees revenue was primarily due to continuing contract penetration driven largely by the company's high-compliance portfolio programs and the addition of new contract categories and suppliers. The growth in net administrative fees was largely offset by the impact of COVID-19 during the three months ended June 30, 2020, which significantly impacted full year growth.\nA summary of net cash flows follows (in thousands):\nWe also urge you to review the reconciliation of these Non-GAAP financial measures included elsewhere in this Annual Report. To properly and prudently evaluate our business, we encourage you to review the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report, and to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. In addition, because the EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Segment Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income, Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share and Free Cash Flow measures are susceptible to varying calculations, such Non-GAAP financial measures may differ from, and may therefore not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nOperating expenses increased by $24.3 million during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to an increase of $20.9 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, an increase of $2.2 million in amortization of intangible assets and an increase of $1.2 million in research and development expenses.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCost of services revenue in our Performance Services segment decreased by $0.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. An increase in amortization of internally developed software applications was offset by a decrease in salaries and benefits in the current year due to lower headcount as a result of staffing efficiencies implemented in the prior year and a decrease due to the impact of the New Revenue Standard on the recognition of certain consulting expenses which were historically recognized on a gross basis under the Previous Revenue Standard, but are now recognized on a net basis under the New Revenue Standard.\nWe record tax receivable agreement (\"TRA\") liabilities based on 85% of the estimated amount of tax savings we expect to receive, generally over a 15-year period, in connection with the additional tax benefits created in conjunction with the initial public offering (\"IPO\"). Absent a TRA Termination Event, tax payments under the TRA will be made to the member owners as we realize tax benefits attributable to the initial purchase of Class B common units from the member owners made concurrently with the IPO and any subsequent exchanges of Class B common units into Class A common stock or cash between us and the member owners. Determining the estimated amount of tax savings we expect to receive requires judgment as deductibility of goodwill amortization expense is not assured and the estimate of tax savings is dependent upon the actual realization of the tax benefit and the tax rates in effect at that time.\n \u2022 Limited access to our members' facilities that impacts our ability to fulfill our contractual requirements. Our member hospitals and non-acute care sites have experienced reduced or limited access for non-patients, including our field teams, consultants and other professionals, and travel restrictions have impacted our employees' ability to travel to our members' facilities. The long-term continuation, or any future recurrence of these circumstances may negatively impact the ability of our employees to more effectively deliver existing or sell new products and services to our members and could affect our performance of our existing contracts. \nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest decreased by $49.3 million, or 22%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to a decrease in non-controlling ownership interest percentage in Premier LP to 51% from 60%, as well as a decrease in Premier LP net income, which was largely driven by the increased loss from discontinued operations, net of tax in the current year.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nWe enter into agreements where the individual deliverables discussed above, such as SaaS subscriptions and consulting services, are bundled into a single service arrangement. These agreements are generally provided over a time period ranging from approximately three months to five years after the applicable contract execution date. Revenue, including both fixed and variable consideration, is allocated to the individual performance obligations within the arrangement based on the stand-alone selling price when it is sold separately in a stand-alone arrangement.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAt our option, committed loans may be in the form of Eurodollar rate loans (\"Eurodollar Loans\") or base rate loans (\"Base Rate Loans\"). Eurodollar Loans bear interest at the Eurodollar rate (defined as the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus the Applicable Rate (defined as a margin based on the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility))). Base Rate Loans bear interest at the Base Rate (defined as the highest of the prime rate announced by the administrative agent, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, the one-month LIBOR plus 1.0% and 0.0%) plus the Applicable Rate. The Applicable Rate ranges from 1.000% to 1.500% for Eurodollar Loans and 0.000% to 0.500% for Base Rate Loans. In the event that LIBOR is no longer available, the Credit Facility states that interest will be calculated based upon rates offered to leading banks for comparable loans by leading banks in the London interbank market. At June 30, 2020, the interest rate for one-month Eurodollar Loans was 1.162% and the interest rate for Base Rate Loans was 3.250%. The Co-Borrowers are required to pay a commitment fee ranging from 0.100% to 0.200% per annum on the actual daily unused amount of commitments under the Credit Facility. At June 30, 2020, the commitment fee was 0.100%.\nProduct revenue increased by $85.8 million, or 47%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by the aggregated purchasing of personal protective equipment as a result of COVID-19 and growth in commodity products and aggregated purchasing of certain products.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOn May 7, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300.0 million of our outstanding Class A common stock during fiscal year 2020. During fiscal year 2020, we purchased an aggregate of 4.6 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $32.28 per share for a total purchase price of $150.0 million under our fiscal year 2020 stock repurchase program. On August 5, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.19 per share, payable on September 15, 2020 to stockholders of record on September 1, 2020.\nSupply Chain Services segment cost of revenue increased by $71.5 million, or 41%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019, and increased by $14.0 million, or 9%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018.\nDuring the second half of fiscal 2020, COVID-19 became a global pandemic that spread throughout the United States and much of the rest of the world. In addition to those who have been directly affected with the disease, millions more have been affected by government and voluntary efforts around the world to slow the spread of the pandemic through quarantines, travel restrictions, business shut-downs, heightened border security and other measures. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, the actions to contain it or treat its impact, including the timing, development and deployment of an effective vaccine, or recurrences of COVID-19 or similar pandemics. As discussed in detail under \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" above, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and potential future pandemic outbreaks, we face significant risks including but not limited to the following:\n\nThe variances in the material factors contributing to the changes in consolidated net revenue are discussed further in \"Segment Results\" below.\nSupply Chain Services revenue consists of GPO net administrative fees (gross administrative fees received from suppliers, reduced by the amount of any revenue share paid to members), supply chain co-management and direct sourcing revenue.\nGain or loss on FFF put and call rights\n\nProceeds from borrowings under the Credit Facility may generally be used to finance ongoing working capital requirements, including permitted acquisitions, cash dividends, if and when declared, repurchases of Class A common stock pursuant to stock repurchase programs, in place from time to time, and other general corporate activities. We had $75.0 million outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility at June 30, 2020 with $925.0 million of available borrowing capacity after reductions for outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit. On July 31, 2020, we repaid $25.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility.\nOperating expenses increased by $21.5 million, or 13%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to an increase of $16.1 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and an increase of $5.4 million in intangible asset amortization.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table provides the reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to stockholders to Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income and the reconciliation of the numerator and denominator for earnings per share attributable to stockholders to Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share for the periods presented (in thousands). Refer to \"Our Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for further information regarding items excluded in our calculation of Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income and Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share.\nOn June 7, 2019, we completed the sale of prescription files and records and certain other assets used in our specialty pharmacy business for $22.3 million. We also received $7.6 million related to the sale of a portion of our pharmaceutical inventory on June 10, 2019, and an additional $3.6 million on July 24, 2019 primarily in connection with the sale of our remaining pharmaceutical inventory. In addition, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, we had substantially completed the wind down and exit from the specialty pharmacy business. We recognized non-cash impairment charges of $80.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2019 related to goodwill, purchased intangibles and other assets of the specialty pharmacy business that were not sold or did not have an alternative use.\n\nGoodwill\nrequired to perform a quantitative assessment to determine whether or not goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if any.\nNet administrative fees revenue increased by $18.6 million, or 3%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018, due in part to the impact of revenue recognition under the New Revenue Standard. Net administrative fees recognized in the year ended June 30, 2019 under the Previous Revenue Standard increased $10.5 million, or 2%, over the prior year. Growth was primarily due to further contract penetration of existing members and, to a lesser degree, the impact of conversion of new members to our portfolio, partially offset by higher revenue recoveries in the prior year.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $16.1 million, or 11%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 driven by increased expenses associated with current year acquisitions and expenses associated with our strategic initiatives. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in employee travel and meeting expenses as a result of the elimination of employee travel due to COVID-19.\nResults of operations for all periods presented have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect continuing operations unless otherwise indicated.", "item_7_text": "\nOther Services and Support Revenue\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA in the Supply Chain Services segment increased by $22.3 million, or 4%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. The increase was driven by growth in net administrative fees revenue, an increase in product revenue driven by aggregated purchasing of certain products as a result of COVID-19 and growth in commodity products, an increase in earnings from our 49% equity investment with FFF and a decrease in employee travel and meeting expenses as a result of the elimination of employee travel due to COVID-19. These increases were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses as a result of current year acquisitions as well as the significant impact of COVID-19 to the full year growth of net administrative fees revenue during the three months ended June 30, 2020.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interest\nIn determining our tax expense for financial reporting purposes, we establish a reserve for uncertain income tax positions unless it is determined to be \"more likely than not\" that such tax positions would be sustained upon examination, based on their technical merits. That is, for financial reporting purposes, we only recognize tax benefits taken on the tax return if we believe it is \"more likely than not\" that such tax positions would be sustained. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether it is \"more likely than not\" that positions taken on the tax returns would be sustained.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nWe expect continued near-term growth of our direct sourcing product revenues due to the impact of COVID-19. Long-term, we expect our direct sourcing product revenues to continue to grow to the extent we are able to increase our product offerings, expand our product sales to existing members and additional members begin to utilize our programs.\nOperating Expenses\nThe variances in the material factors contributing to the changes in consolidated cost of revenue are discussed further in \"Segment Results\" below.\nAdjusted EBITDA remained relatively flat during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA in the Performance Services segment decreased by $17.9 million, or 14%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily as a result of the aforementioned decrease in other services and support revenue and increase in operating expenses as a result of recent acquisitions partially offset by the decrease in employee travel and meeting expenses as a result of the elimination of employee travel due to COVID-19.\nOn October 28, 2019, we, through its consolidated subsidiary, Premier Supply Chain Improvement, Inc. (\"PSCI\"), acquired all of the outstanding capital stock in Medpricer.com, Inc. (\"Medpricer\") for an adjusted purchase price of $38.5 million, giving effect to certain purchase price adjustments provided for in the purchase agreement. The transaction was funded with borrowings under the Credit Facility. Medpricer is a SaaS-based provider of technology solutions that enable hospitals and other organizations to analyze, benchmark and source purchased services contracts independent of any existing GPO affiliation. Recently, Medpricer changed its name to Conductiv, Inc. (\"Conductiv\") and is reported as part of the Supply Chain Services segment. See Note 3 - Business Acquisitions to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further information.\nBusiness Combinations\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $4.8 million, or 3%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019, primarily due a decrease in stock-based compensation expense due to lower achievement of certain performance targets relative to the prior year and a decrease in employee travel and meeting expenses as a result of the elimination of employee travel due to COVID-19. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in technology expenses driven by software subscriptions associated with recent acquisitions.\nOther income (expense), net increased by $10.5 million during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to an increase of $6.8 million in equity in net income from our investments in unconsolidated affiliates and a decrease of $6.2 million in losses on disposals of long-lived assets.\n\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nWe adjust tax reserve estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by, and settlements with, varying taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations. The consolidated tax expense of any given year includes adjustments to prior year income tax reserve and related estimated interest charges that are considered appropriate. Our policy is to recognize, when applicable, interest and penalties on uncertain income tax positions as part of income tax expense.\nOther (expense) income, net increased by $22.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to the $22.0 million loss on FFF put and call rights in the prior year and the impairment on investments recorded in the prior year.\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased by $218.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to year ended June 30, 2019. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase of $125.0 million in net borrowings under the Credit Facility, a decrease of $100.0 million in repurchases of Class A common stock under the current year stock repurchase program and a decrease of $8.9 million in distributions to limited partners of Premier LP. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in payments on the non-interest bearing notes payable to our departed member owners.\nRemeasurement of TRA liabilities\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets increased by $5.4 million, or 31%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 driven by additional amortization of purchased intangible assets related to acquisitions. Amortization of purchased intangible assets remained flat during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nCorporate operating expenses decreased by $4.8 million, or 3%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019, and decreased by $1.8 million, or 1%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018.\nAs of June 30, 2020, we were owned, in part, by 155 U.S. hospitals, health systems and other healthcare organizations, which represented approximately 1,475 owned, leased and managed acute care facilities and other non-acute care organizations, through their ownership of Class B common stock. As of June 30, 2020, the outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock represented 59% and 41%, respectively, of our combined outstanding Class A and Class B common stock. As of June 30, 2020,\nOur business model and solutions are designed to provide our members access to scale efficiencies while focusing on optimization of information resources and cost containment, provide actionable intelligence derived from anonymized data in our data warehouse provided by our members, mitigate the risk of innovation and disseminate best practices that will help our member organizations succeed in their transformation to higher quality and more cost-effective healthcare. We deliver our integrated platform of solutions that address the areas of total cost management, quality and safety improvement and value based care through two business segments: Supply Chain Services and Performance Services.\nSee \"Our Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Results of Operations\" below for a discussion of our use of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net income from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA.\nResearch and Development\nRevenue is recognized when, or as, control of a promised product or service transfers to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring those products or services. If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, we estimate the amount to which we expect to be entitled using either the expected value or most likely amount method. Our contracts may include terms that could cause variability in the transaction price, including, for example, revenue share, rebates, discounts, and variable fees based on performance.\nAs of June 30, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nOur Business\nIn addition to non-cash employee stock-based compensation expense, this item includes non-cash stock purchase plan expense of $0.4 million during each of the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nOur Performance Services growth will depend upon the expansion of our SaaS clinical analytics products, performance improvement collaboratives and consulting services to new and existing members, renewal of existing subscriptions to our SaaS and licensed informatics products, and our ability to generate additional applied sciences engagements and expand into new markets.\nUnder accounting rules, we may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. This qualitative assessment requires an evaluation of any excess of fair value over the carrying value for a reporting unit and significant judgment regarding potential changes in valuation inputs, including a review of our most recent long-range projections, analysis of operating results versus the prior year, changes in market values, changes in discount rates and changes in terminal growth rate assumptions. If it is determined that an impairment is more likely than not to exist, then we are\nOperating Expenses\nAt June 30, 2020, we had commitments for obligations under notes payable which represented obligations to departed member owners, our noncancelable office space lease agreements and estimated payments due to limited partners under the TRA. Future payments for such commitments as of June 30, 2020 were as follows (in thousands):\nCash Dividends\nNet Administrative Fees Revenue\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nCost of Revenue\nWe expect cash generated from operations and borrowings under our Credit Facility to provide us with adequate liquidity to fund our anticipated working capital requirements, revenue share obligations, tax payments, capital expenditures, dividend payments on our Class A common stock, if and when declared, and repurchases of Class A common stock pursuant to stock repurchase programs in place from time to time. Our capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including funding requirements for our product and service development and commercialization efforts, our information technology requirements and the amount of cash generated by our operations. We believe that we have adequate capital resources at our disposal to fund currently anticipated capital expenditures, business growth and expansion, and current and projected debt service requirements. However, strategic growth initiatives will likely require the use of one or a combination of various forms of capital resources including available cash on hand, cash generated from operations, borrowings under our Credit Facility and other long-term debt and, potentially, proceeds from the issuance of additional equity or debt securities.\n\nPerformance Services segment operating expenses increased by $7.6 million, or 5%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019, and increased by $17.0 million, or 11%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018.\nSegment net revenue was as follows (in thousands):\nGoodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized. We perform our annual goodwill impairment testing on the first day of the last fiscal quarter of its fiscal year unless impairment indicators are present which could require an interim impairment test.\nIncome (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax\nSome of the limitations of the EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA measures include that they do not reflect: our capital expenditures or our future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; the interest expense or the cash requirements to service interest or principal payments under our Credit Facility; income tax payments we are required to make; and any cash requirements for replacements of assets being depreciated or amortized. In addition, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are not measures of liquidity under GAAP, or otherwise, and are not alternatives to cash flows from operating activities.\n \u2022 Requests for contract modifications, payment deferrals or exercises of force majeure clauses. We have and may continue to receive requests for contract modifications, payment waivers and deferrals, payment reductions or amended payment terms from our contract counterparties. We have and may continue to receive requests to delay service or payment on performance service contracts. In addition, we may receive requests from our suppliers for increases to their contracted prices, and such \nCost of revenue increased by $77.2 million, or 22%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to an increase of $71.2 million in cost of product revenue and an increase of $5.9 million in cost of services revenue.\nWe define Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less distributions and TRA payments to limited partners and purchases of property and equipment. Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow does not represent discretionary cash available for spending as it excludes certain contractual obligations such as debt repayments. A summary of Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow and reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities for the periods presented follows (in thousands):\nto the Unit Exchange Agreements, the remaining amount payable, approximately $462.9 million in the aggregate, will be paid, without interest, to former limited partners that elected to execute Unit Exchange Agreements in 18 equal quarterly installments commencing during the quarter ending March 31, 2021 and ending in the quarter ending June 30, 2025.\nOn May 7, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300.0 million of our outstanding Class A common stock during fiscal year 2020 as a continuation of our balanced capital deployment strategy. During fiscal year 2020, we purchased an aggregate of 4.6 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $32.28 per share for a total purchase price of $150.0 million under our fiscal year 2020 stock repurchase program. In addition, during the year ended June 30, 2020, no shares of Class B common units were exchanged for cash in connection with quarterly member owner exchanges under the Exchange Agreement.\nTRA\nAcquisition of Medpricer\nWe define Segment Adjusted EBITDA as the segment's net revenue less cost of revenue and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment excluding depreciation and amortization, amortization of purchased intangible assets, merger and acquisition related expenses and non-recurring or non-cash items and including equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates. Operating expenses directly attributable to the segment include expenses associated with sales and marketing, general and administrative, and product development activities specific to the operation of each segment. General and administrative corporate expenses that are not specific to a particular segment are not included in the calculation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment Adjusted EBITDA also excludes any income and expense that has been classified as discontinued operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a Non-GAAP financial measure as defined in \"Our Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\", increased by $3.0 million, or 1%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 driven by an increase of $22.3 million in Supply Chain Services partially offset by decreases of $17.9 million and $1.4 million in Performance Services and Corporate, respectively.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nDuring fiscal year 2019, we purchased an aggregate of 6.7 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $37.38 per share for a total purchase price of $250.0 million under our fiscal year 2019 stock repurchase program.\nNet revenue increased by $32.9 million, or 3%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to an increase of $18.7 million in net administrative fees revenue, an increase of $2.5 million in other services and support revenue and an increase of $11.9 million in product revenue.\nSupply Chain Services\n\nrequests may be implemented in the future. In addition, several pharmacy suppliers have exercised force majeure clauses related to failure to supply clauses in their contracts with us because they are unable to obtain raw materials for manufacturing from India and China. The standard failure to supply language in our contracts contains financial penalties to suppliers if they are unable to supply products, which such suppliers may not be able to pay. In addition, we may not be able to source products from alternative suppliers on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nWe prepare and file tax returns based on interpretations of tax laws and regulations. Our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities in the normal course of business. Such examinations may result in future tax, interest and penalty assessments by these taxing authorities.\nDivestiture of Specialty Pharmacy Business - Discontinued Operations\nWe pay a revenue share equal to a percentage of gross administrative fees, which is estimated according to the members' contractual agreements with us using a portfolio approach based on historical revenue fee share percentages and adjusted for current or anticipated trends. Revenue share is recognized as a reduction to gross administrative fees revenue to arrive at a net administrative fees revenue, and the corresponding revenue share liability is included in revenue share obligations in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSupply Chain Services segment revenue increased by $97.6 million, or 11%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. Supply Chain Services segment revenue increased by $31.2 million, or 4%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018.\nBusiness Overview\n \u2022 Managing the evolving regulatory environment. In response to COVID-19, federal, state and local governments are issuing new rules, regulations, changing reimbursement eligibility rules, orders and advisories on a regular basis. These government actions can impact us and our members and suppliers.  The ultimate impact of COVID-19, recurrences, or similar pandemics on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows is dependent on future developments, including the duration of any pandemic and the related length of its impact on the United States and global economies, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, recurrences, or future similar pandemics may also exacerbate many of the other risks described in this \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" section. Despite our efforts to manage these impacts, their ultimate impact depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of any outbreak and actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects. The foregoing and other continued disruptions in our business as a result of COVID-19 could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, prospects and the trading prices of our securities in the near-term and beyond 2020.\nProduct revenue increased by $11.8 million, or 7%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by growth in commodity products and aggregated purchasing of certain products, partially offset by the $3.1 million impact of revenue recognition under the New Revenue Standard on distributor fees, which were historically recognized on a gross basis under the Previous Revenue Standard but are now recognized on a net basis under the New Revenue Standard.\nAdjusted Fully Distributed Net Income, a Non-GAAP financial measure as defined below in \"Our Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\", is calculated net of taxes based on our fully distributed estimated statutory tax rate for federal and state income tax for us as if we were one consolidated taxable group with all of our subsidiaries' activities included. Prior to the enactment of the TCJA, the tax rate used to compute the Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income was 39%. Effective January 1, 2018, we used a fully distributed tax rate of 26% to compute the Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income.\nCost of revenue consists of cost of service revenue and cost of product revenue.\n (a) Estimated payments due to limited partners under the TRA are based on 85% of the estimated amount of tax savings we expect to receive, generally over a 15-year period. \nCost of Revenue\nWe expect our other services and support revenue to grow over the long-term to the extent we are able to expand our sales to existing members and additional members begin to utilize our integrated platform of products and services.\nOther services and support revenue in our Performance Services segment decreased by $15.6 million, or 4%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower demand in consulting services and a decrease in revenue as a result of the planned reduction and subsequent discontinuance of the Hospital Improvement Innovation Network contract. These decreases were partially offset by growth in technology license contracts as a result of new enterprise license agreements.\nCost of product revenue increased by $71.3 million, or 41%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 and increased by $18.6 million, or 12%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. These increases were both driven by higher costs associated with the aforementioned growth in direct sourcing sales, which during the year ended June 30, 2020 was significantly impacted by COVID-19. We expect our cost of product revenue to increase to the extent we are able to sell additional direct-sourced medical products to new and existing members. Increases in cost of product revenues could reduce our gross profit as a percentage of our net revenues depending on the underlying product sales mix.\nCost of revenue increased $13.6 million, or 4%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to an increase of $18.7 million in cost of product revenue partially offset by a decrease of $5.0 million in cost of services revenue.\nGiven our ownership and capital structure, various effective tax rates are calculated for specific tax items. For example, the deferred tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense (see Note 14 - Stock-Based Compensation) is calculated based on the effective tax rate of PHSI, the legal entity where the majority of stock-based compensation expense is recorded. Our effective tax rate, as discussed in Note 16 - Income Taxes, represents the effective tax rate computed in accordance with GAAP based on total income tax expense (reflected in income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income) of Premier, Inc., PHSI, PSCI and PMLLC divided by consolidated pre-tax income.\nNet cash provided by operating activities attributable to discontinued operations increased by $16.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to payments on liabilities that were outstanding as of June 30, 2019.\n \u2022 Changes in the demand for our products and services. We have experienced and may continue to experience demand uncertainty from both significant increases and decreases in demand as a result of COVID-19. There has been a significant increase in demand for personal protective equipment (\"PPE\"), drugs and other supplies directly related to treating and preventing the spread of COVID-19. However, either voluntarily or due to government orders or advisories, patients, hospitals and other medical facilities have deferred elective procedures and routine medical visits during the crisis, which created a significant decline in the demand for supplies and services not related to COVID-19 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and such lower demand is expected to continue into fiscal 2021. In addition, as a result of our members' focus on managing COVID-19 and its impacts, we have experienced a decrease in demand for our consulting and other performance service engagements. Furthermore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our members' non-acute or non-healthcare facilities, such as education and hospitality businesses, closed, operated on a limited or reduced basis and have delayed re-opening, and, as a result, we may see a material reduction in product sales to those facilities. The extent to which these impacts on demand will continue, and the effect that they will have on our business and operating results, will depend upon future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. \nAcquisition of Health Design Plus, LLC\nWe account for acquisitions of a business using the acquisition method. All the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies and contingent consideration are generally recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related costs are recorded as expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.\nCost of Revenue\nResearch and development expenses consist of employee-related compensation and benefit expenses and third-party consulting fees of technology professionals, net of capitalized labor, incurred to develop our software-related products and services.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets includes the amortization of all identified intangible assets.\nWe sell perpetual and term licenses that include post-contract customer support in the form of maintenance and support services. Pricing varies by application and size of healthcare system. Fees for the initial period include the license fees, implementation fees and the initial bundled maintenance and support services fees. The maintenance fees for the initial period are recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining initial period following implementation. Subsequent renewal maintenance and support services fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractually stated renewal periods. Implementation services are provided to the customer prior to the use of the software and do not involve significant customization or modification. Implementation is generally 250 to 300 days following contract execution before the licensed software products can be fully utilized by the member.\nSee \"Our Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" above for additional information regarding our use of Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow.\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates as well as net operating losses and credit carryforwards, which will be in effect when these differences reverse. We provide a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets when, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nOther Operating Income\nThe success of our Supply Chain Services revenue streams are influenced by our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with suppliers and members, the number of members that utilize our GPO supplier contracts and the volume of their purchases, as well as the impact of changes in the defined allowable reimbursement amounts determined by Medicare, Medicaid and other managed care plans and the number of members that purchase products through our direct sourcing activities and the impact of competitive pricing.\n (e) Additional consideration to be paid pursuant to the Purchase Agreement for the Acurity and Nexera asset acquisition.  Credit Facility\n (a) Reflects income tax expense at our estimated effective income tax rate of 26% of adjusted fully distributed net income before income taxes for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, and 32% of adjusted fully distributed income before income taxes for the year ended June 30, 2018. \nSupply Chain Services\nOn August 5, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.19 per share, payable on September 15, 2020 to stockholders of record on September 1, 2020. We currently expect quarterly dividends to continue to be paid on or about December 15, March 15, June 15, and September 15. However, the actual declaration of any future cash dividends, and the setting of record and payment dates as well as the per share amounts, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors each quarter after consideration of various factors, including our results of operations, financial condition and capital requirements, earnings, general business conditions, restrictions imposed by our current credit facility and any future financing arrangements, legal restrictions on the payment of dividends and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.\ninterest income and expense, realized and unrealized gains or losses on deferred compensation plan assets, gains or losses on the disposal of assets, and any impairment on our held-to-maturity investments.\nPerformance Services revenue consists of SaaS clinical analytics products subscriptions, license fees, performance improvement collaborative and other service subscriptions, professional fees for consulting services, third party administrator fees for our direct to employer initiative and insurance services management fees and commissions from group-sponsored insurance programs.\nResearch and development expenses consist of employee-related compensation and benefit expenses and third-party consulting fees for technology professionals, net of capitalized labor, incurred to develop our software-related products and services. Research and development expenses increased by $1.2 million, or 100%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. Research and development remained flat during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018.\nWe account for a contract with a customer when the contract is committed, the rights of the parties, including payment terms, are identified, the contract has commercial substance and consideration is probable of collection.\nOur most recent annual impairment testing as of April 1, 2020 consisted of a quantitative assessment and did not result in any goodwill impairment charges. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, we performed an interim assessment of goodwill and other long-lived assets of the specialty pharmacy business for impairment following the announcement of our commitment to sell certain assets of the specialty pharmacy business and to wind down and exit the specialty pharmacy business. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations and Exit Activities to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further information.\nIncome tax expense increased by $59.1 million, or 176%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to an increase in deferred tax expense related to deferred tax remeasurement as a result of North Carolina state tax law changes.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA in the Performance Services segment increased by $5.7 million, or 5%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 primarily as a result of increased other services and support revenue and decreased salaries and benefits expenses in the current year due to lower headcount as a result of staffing efficiencies implemented in the prior year, partially offset by incremental expense resulting from the acquisition in the current year and increased bad debt expense.\nAmortization of Purchased Intangible Assets\nWe enter into lease contracts in which we are the lessee, substantially all of which are related to office space leased in various buildings used for general corporate purposes. The terms of these non-cancelable operating leases typically require us to pay rent and a share of operating expenses and real estate taxes, generally with an inflation-based rent increase included. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nTrends in the U.S. healthcare market affect our revenues and costs in the Supply Chain Services and Performance Services segments. The trends we see affecting our current healthcare business include the impact of the implementation of current or future healthcare legislation, particularly the uncertainty regarding the status of the Affordable Care Act, its repeal, replacement or other modification, the enactment of new regulatory and reporting requirements, expansion and contraction of insurance coverage and associated costs that may impact subscriber elections, intense cost pressure, payment reform, provider consolidation, shift in care to the alternate site market and increased data availability and transparency. To meet the demands of this environment, there will be increased focus on scale and cost containment and healthcare providers will need to measure and report on and bear financial risk for outcomes. Over the long-term, we believe these trends will result in increased demand for our Supply Chain Services and Performance Services solutions in the areas of cost management, quality and safety, and value based care, however, there are uncertainties and risks that may affect the actual impact of these anticipated trends, expected demand for our services or related assumptions on our business. See \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" for more information.\nThe variances in the material factors contributing to the changes in consolidated Adjusted EBITDA are discussed further in \"Segment Results\" below.\nThe following table provides certain Non-GAAP financial measures for the fiscal years presented (in thousands, except per share data). Refer to \"Our Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for further information regarding items excluded in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased by $1.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 driven by an increase in technology expenses driven by software subscriptions associated with recent acquisitions partially offset by a decrease in employee travel and meeting expenses as a result of the elimination of employee travel due to COVID-19.\nAs we execute on our growth strategy and further deploy capital, we expect increases in amortization of intangible assets in connection with future potential acquisitions.\nCost of service revenue includes expenses related to employees (including compensation and benefits) and outside consultants who directly provide services related to revenue-generating activities, including consulting services to members and implementation services related to SaaS clinical analytics along with associated amortization of certain capitalized contract costs. Amortization of contract costs represent amounts that have been capitalized and reflect the incremental costs of obtaining and fulfilling a contract. Amortization of contract costs included within cost of service revenue include costs related to implementing SaaS informatics tools. Cost of service revenue also includes expenses related to hosting services, related data center capacity costs, third-party product license expenses and amortization of the cost of internally developed software applications.\n (a) Reflects income tax expense at our estimated effective income tax rate of 26% of adjusted fully distributed net income before income taxes for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, and 32% of adjusted fully distributed income before income taxes for the year ended June 30, 2018. \n\nOur income tax expense is attributable to the activities of Premier, Inc., PHSI, PSCI and Premier Marketplace, LLC (\"PMLLC\"), all of which are subchapter C corporations and are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. In contrast, under the provisions of federal and state laws, Premier LP is not subject to federal and state income taxes as the income realized by Premier LP is taxable to its partners. Our overall effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the ownership structure as well as other items noted in Note 16 - Income Taxes.\nWe expect that certain trends and economic or industry-wide factors will continue to affect our business, both in the short-term and long-term. We have based our expectations described below on assumptions made by us and on information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about, or interpretation of, available information prove to be incorrect our actual\nOur Performance Services segment includes one of the largest informatics and consulting services businesses in the United States focused on healthcare providers. Our software as a service (\"SaaS\") based clinical analytics products and technology licenses utilize our comprehensive data set to provide actionable intelligence to our members, enabling them to benchmark, analyze and identify areas of improvement across three main categories: cost management, quality and safety, and value based care. The Performance Services segment also includes our technology enabled performance improvement collaboratives, consulting services, direct to employer initiative and insurance management services.\nOther operating income of $24.6 million during the year ended June 30, 2020 is attributable to the remeasurement of the TRA liability as a result of the change in North Carolina state income tax law. Other operating income of $177.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2018 represents the remeasurement of TRA liabilities driven by the 14% decrease in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate associated with the TCJA that was enacted on December 22, 2017.\nNet Revenue\nCost of services revenue in our Performance Services segment increased by $5.7 million, or 3%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to increased amortization of internally-developed software applications.\nWe expect cost of service revenue to increase to the extent we continue to develop new and enhance existing internally developed software applications, expand our consulting services and performance improvement collaboratives and expand into new product offerings.\nCosts associated with internally developed computer software that are incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. During the development stage, direct consulting costs and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees that are directly associated with each project are capitalized. Internal use capitalized software costs are included in property and equipment, net in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related software applications of up to five years and amortization is included in cost of revenue or selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, based on the software's end use. Replacements and major improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this process involve determining the stages of the software development project, the direct costs to capitalize and the estimated useful life of the capitalized software.\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations and Adjusted EBITDA in the Performance Services segment for the fiscal years presented (in thousands):\n\nNet administrative fees revenue is a single performance obligation earned through a series of distinct daily services and includes maintaining a network of members to participate in the group purchasing program and providing suppliers efficiency in contracting and access to our members. Revenue is generated through administrative fees received from suppliers and is included in service revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.\nDeferred revenue consists of unrecognized revenue related to advanced customer invoicing or member payments received prior to fulfillment of our revenue recognition criteria. Substantially all deferred revenue consists of deferred subscription fees and deferred consulting fees. Subscription fees for Company-hosted SaaS applications are deferred until the customer's unique data records have been incorporated into the underlying software database, or until customer site-specific software has been implemented and the customer has access to the software. Deferred consulting fees arise upon invoicing to customers prior to services being performed.\nAcquisition related expenses include legal, accounting and other expenses related to acquisition activities and gains and losses on the change in fair value of earn-out liabilities. Disposition related expenses include severance and retention benefits and financial advisor fees and legal fees related to disposition activities.\nThe following table provides the reconciliation of net income from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation of income before income taxes to Segment Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands). Refer to \"Our Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for further information regarding items excluded in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA.\nOn August 10, 2020, Premier exercised its right to terminate the TRA by providing all former limited partners a notice of the termination and the amount of the expected payment to be made to each former limited partner pursuant to the early termination provisions of the TRA (each such amount an \"Early Termination Payment\") with a determination date of August 10, 2020. The aggregate amount of the Early Termination Payments is approximately $473.5 million. Of that amount, approximately $10.6 million is payable within three business days after the date the Early Termination Payment becomes final, which is expected to be on or about September 15, 2020, to former limited partners that did not elect to execute Unit Exchange Agreements. Pursuant\nOther income (expense), net, includes equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates that is generated from our equity method investments. Our equity method investments primarily consist of our 49% ownership in FFF Enterprises, Inc. (\"FFF\"). Other income (expense), net, also includes the change in fair value of our FFF put and call rights (see Note 6 - Fair Value Measurements),\nCost of Revenue\nIncome Taxes\nWe only include estimated amounts of consideration in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. These estimates require management to make complex, difficult or subjective judgments, and to make estimates about the effect of matters\nNet revenue increased by $82.0 million, or 7%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to an increase of $85.7 million in product revenue and an increase of $8.1 million in net administrative fees revenue. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $11.9 million in other services and support revenue.\nWe record TRA liabilities based on 85% of the estimated amount of tax savings we expect to receive, generally over a 15-year period, which are attributable to the initial purchase of Class B common units from the member owners made concurrently with the IPO and subsequent exchanges by member owners of Class B common units into Class A common stock or cash. Tax payments made under the TRA will be made to the member owners as we realize tax benefits. Determining the estimated amount of tax savings we expect to receive requires judgment as deductibility of goodwill amortization expense is not assured and the estimate of tax savings is dependent upon the actual realization of the tax benefit and the tax rates in effect at that time.\nNet revenue consists of service revenue, which includes net administrative fees revenue and other services and support revenue, and product revenue. Net administrative fees revenue consists of GPO administrative fees in our Supply Chain Services segment. Other services and support revenue consists primarily of fees generated by our Performance Services segment in connection with our SaaS and licensed-based clinical analytics products subscriptions, license fees, third party administrator fees and consulting services and performance improvement collaborative subscriptions. Product revenue consists of direct sourcing product sales, which are included in the Supply Chain Services segment.\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations and Adjusted EBITDA, a Non-GAAP financial measure, in the Supply Chain Services segment for the fiscal years presented (in thousands):\nChanges in estimated TRA liabilities that are the result of a change in tax accounting method, including the impacts of the TCJA, are recorded as a component of other operating income or selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Changes in estimated TRA liabilities that are related to new basis changes as a result of the exchange of Class B common units for a like number of shares of Class A common stock or as a result of departed member owners are recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity (Deficit).\nDiscussion of Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow for the Years Ended June 30, 2020 and 2019\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion is designed to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles affect our consolidated financial statements. In addition, the following discussion includes certain forward-looking statements. For a discussion of important factors, including the continuing development of our business and other factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results referred to in the forward-looking statements, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" and \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" contained in this Annual Report. Unless otherwise indicated, information in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect continuing operations for all periods presented. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations and Exit Activities to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further information.\nOperating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term beginning at the commencement date. Operating lease right-of-use assets are adjusted for lease incentives, deferred rent and initial direct costs, if incurred. Our leases generally do not include an implicit rate; therefore, we determined the present value of future minimum lease payments using an incremental borrowing rate based on information available as of July 1, 2019, the transition date. The related lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nOther Operating Income\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $172.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was driven by the prepaid contract administrative fee share of $93.8 million for one-time rebates paid by Acurity, Inc. to certain of its then members, as agreed to by Acurity, Inc. prior to entering into the Purchase Agreement. These payments were excluded from the purchase price of the Acurity and Nexera asset acquisition. As of June 30, 2020, we had capitalized $87.3 million on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized $6.5 million to net revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. In addition, the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to a decrease in our working capital primarily driven by the impact of the aggregated purchasing of personal protective equipment as a result of COVID-19, an increase in acquisition and disposition related expenses associated with certain strategic initiatives and lower profitability in our Performance Services segment. These decreases were partially offset by growth in net administrative fees revenue in our Supply Chain Services segment and the remeasurement of the TRA in the current period.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $16.7 million, or 15%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 primarily driven by increased amortization of internally developed software applications, expenses associated with acquisitions and higher bad debt expense primarily due to a hospital bankruptcy.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nAs of June 30, 2020 and 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $99.3 million and $141.1 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, there was $75.0 million and $25.0 million, respectively, of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. During the year ended June 30, 2020, we borrowed $400.0 million and repaid $350.0 million of borrowings under the Credit Facility, which was used to fund acquisitions during the current year, share repurchases under the fiscal 2020 stock repurchase program, and for other general corporate activities. On July 31, 2020, we repaid $25.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility.\n (c) Future contractual obligations for leases represent future minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases primarily for office space. \nOther operating income of $24.6 million during the year ended June 30, 2020 is attributable to the remeasurement of the TRA liability as a result of the change in North Carolina state income tax law. Other operating income of $177.2 million during the year ended June 30, 2018 is attributable to the remeasurement of TRA liabilities driven by the 14% decrease in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate associated with the TCJA that was enacted on December 22, 2017.\nAs we execute on our growth strategy and further deploy capital, we expect increases in amortization of intangible assets in connection with future potential acquisitions.\nNon-recurring and non-cash items excluded in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income consist of stock-based compensation, acquisition and disposition related expenses, remeasurement of TRA liabilities, loss on disposal of long-lived assets, gain or loss on FFF put and call rights, income and expense that has been classified as discontinued operations and other expense. More information about certain of the more significant items follows below.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe following table provides the reconciliation of earnings (loss) per share attributable to stockholders to Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share for the periods presented. Refer to \"Our Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for further information regarding items excluded in our calculation of Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share.\nnm = not meaningful\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA in the Supply Chain Services segment increased by $16.2 million, or 3%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. The increase was primarily a result of growth in net administrative fees revenue and growth in service fees from our academic initiative, partially offset by a decline in gross margin associated with product revenue.\nAs further described in Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies, we adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (\"New Lease Standard\") effective July 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. The modified retrospective approach resulted in recognizing the cumulative effect of initially applying the New Lease Standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of equity at July 1, 2019. Therefore, the comparative information is presented in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 840 (\"Previous Lease Standard\").\n \u2022 Materials and personnel shortages and disruptions in supply chain, including manufacturing and shipping. The global supply chain has been significantly disrupted due to stay at home orders, border closings and rapidly escalating shipping costs. Borders closings and restrictions in response to COVID-19, particularly regarding China and India, have impacted our access to products for our members. Staffing or personnel shortages due to shelter in place orders and quarantines have impacted and in the future may impact us and our members or suppliers. In addition, due to unprecedented demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, there are widespread shortages in certain product categories. In the food service line, COVID-19 related illnesses have impacted food processing suppliers and led to plant closures. If the supply chain for materials used in the products purchased by our members through our GPO or products contract manufactured through our direct sourcing business is adversely impacted by restrictions resulting from COVID-19, our supply chain may be disrupted. Failure of our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors and other business partners to meet their obligations to our members or to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so due to their own financial or operational difficulties, may adversely impact our operations. \nNew accounting standards that we have recently adopted as well as those that have been recently issued but not yet adopted by us are included in Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nWe define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less distributions and TRA payments to limited partners and purchases of property and equipment. Free Cash Flow does not represent discretionary cash available for spending as it excludes certain contractual obligations such as debt repayments.\nSoftware Development Costs\nDeferred Revenue\nAcquisition and disposition related expenses\nLeases\n\nresults may vary materially from our expected results. See \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" and \"Risk Factors.\"\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $1.2 million during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. Expenses decreased due to the impact of the New Revenue Standard on distributor fees associated with direct sourcing revenue and due to decreased general overhead expenses in the current year. These decreases were offset by increased expenses associated with our strategic initiatives.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $20.9 million, or 5%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $13.7 million, or 3%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. The variances in the material factors contributing to the changes in consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses are discussed further in \"Segment Results\" below.\n \u2022 Our GPO member hospitals and non-acute care sites have experienced reduced or limited access for non-patients, including our field teams, consultants and other professionals, and travel restrictions have impacted our employees' ability to travel to our members' facilities. \n \u2022 We have experienced and may continue to experience demand uncertainty from both significant increases in demand for PPE, drugs and other products related to the treatment of COVID-19 and decreases in demand for non-COVID-19 related products. \ntaxes at our estimated effective income tax rate. We define Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share as Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income divided by diluted weighted average shares (see Note 13 - Earnings (Loss) Per Share).\n \u2022 In response to COVID-19, federal, state and local governments are issuing new rules, regulations, changing reimbursement eligibility rules, orders and advisories on a regular basis. These government actions can impact us and our members and suppliers.  Discussion of Cash Flows for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019\nLLC (\"Contigo Health\") and is reported as part of the Performance Services segment. See Note 3 - Business Acquisitions to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further information.\nall of our Class B common stock was held beneficially by our member owners and all of our Class A common stock was held by public investors, which may include member owners that have received shares of our Class A common stock in connection with previous quarterly exchanges pursuant to an exchange agreement (the \"Exchange Agreement\") (see Note 1 - Organization and Basis of Presentation to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for more information). On August 11, 2020, we executed a corporate restructuring as described in \"Item 1. Business\" under \"Recent Restructuring\" and in Note 21 - Subsequent Events to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements.\nAlthough we believe that our approach in developing estimates and reliance on certain judgments and underlying inputs is reasonable, actual results could differ which may result in exposure of increases or decreases in revenue that could be material.\nPremier, Inc. (\"Premier\", the \"Company\", \"we\", or \"our\") is a leading healthcare improvement company, uniting an alliance of more than 4,100 U.S. hospitals and health systems and approximately 200,000 other providers and organizations to transform healthcare. We partner with hospitals, health systems, physicians and other healthcare providers with the common goal of improving and innovating in the clinical, financial and operational areas of their businesses to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving healthcare industry. We deliver value through a comprehensive technology-enabled platform that offers critical supply chain services, clinical, financial, operational and value based care software-as-a-service (\"SaaS\") and licensed-based clinical analytics products, consulting services and performance improvement collaborative programs.\nInsurance services management fees are recognized in the period in which such services are provided. Commissions from group sponsored insurance programs are earned by acting as an intermediary in the placement of effective insurance policies. Under this arrangement, revenue is recognized at a point in time on the effective date of the associated policies when control of the policy transfers to the customer and is constrained for estimated early terminations.\n\nAs of June 30, 2020, we owned a 59% controlling general partner interest in Premier LP through Premier GP. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest represents the portion of net income attributable to the limited partners of Premier LP, which was 41% and 51% as of June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively (see Note 11 - Redeemable Limited Partners' Capital).\nChanges in estimated TRA liabilities that are the result of a change in tax accounting method are recorded in remeasurement of tax receivable agreement liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Changes in estimated TRA liabilities that are related to new basis changes as a result of the exchange of Class B common units for a like number of shares of Class A common stock or as a result of departed member owners are recorded as an increase or decrease to additional paid-in capital in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity (Deficit).\nOperating Expenses\nOther Services and Support Revenue\nThe variances in the material factors contributing to the changes in consolidated operating expense are discussed further in \"Segment Results\" below.\nThe Credit Facility also contains customary events of default including, among others, payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults of any indebtedness or guarantees in excess of $75.0 million, bankruptcy and other insolvency events, ERISA-related liabilities and judgment defaults in excess of $50.0 million, and the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the Credit Facility). If any event of default occurs and is continuing, the administrative agent under the Credit Facility may, with the consent, or shall, at the request of a majority of the lenders under the Credit Facility, terminate the commitments and declare all of the amounts owed under the Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable. We may prepay amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility without premium or penalty provided that Co-Borrowers compensate the lenders for losses and expenses incurred as a result of the prepayment of any Eurodollar Loan, as defined in the Credit Facility.\nNet Revenue\n \u2022 We have and may continue to receive requests for contract modifications, payment waivers and deferrals, payment reductions or amended payment terms from our contract counterparties. In addition, several pharmacy suppliers have exercised force majeure clauses related to failure to supply clauses in their contracts with us. \nOther services and support revenue in our Performance Services segment increased by $1.8 million during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. The increase was driven by growth in applied sciences and cost management consulting services, as revenue is now recognized proportionally to when services are provided under the New Revenue Standard whereas revenue recognition was deferred in certain circumstances until certain performance conditions were met under the Previous Revenue Standard, as well as revenue from acquisitions, which contributed $3.7 million in growth. These increases were offset by the impact of revenue that was historically recognized on a gross basis under the Previous Revenue Standard but was recognized on a net basis under the New Revenue Standard and a decrease related to the timing of certain contracts ending in the cost management and quality and safety businesses.\nAcquisition of Acurity and Nexera Assets\nWithin Performance Services, which provides technology with wrap-around service offerings, revenue consists of SaaS clinical analytics products subscriptions, perpetual and term licenses, performance improvement collaboratives and other service subscriptions, professional fees for consulting services, third-party administrator fees for the direct to employer initiative and insurance services management fees and commissions from group-sponsored insurance programs.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets decreased by $3.2 million, or 9%, to $32.6 million during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019, and remained relatively flat during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018.\nNet Revenue\nOperating Expenses\nPursuant to the TRA, we will pay member owners 85% of the tax savings, if any, in U.S. federal, foreign, state and local income and franchise tax that we actually realize (or are deemed to realize, in the case of payments required to be made upon certain occurrences under the TRA) in connection with the Section 754 election. The election results in adjustments to the tax basis of the assets of Premier LP upon member owner exchanges of Class B common units of Premier LP for Class A common stock of Premier, Inc., cash or a combination of both. Tax savings are generated as a result of the increases in tax basis resulting from the initial sale of Class B common units, subsequent exchanges (pursuant to the Exchange Agreement) and payments under the TRA.\ninherently uncertain. As such, we may not be able to reliably estimate variable fees based on performance in certain long-term arrangements due to uncertainties that are not expected to be resolved for a long period of time or when our experience with similar types of contracts is limited. Estimates of variable consideration and the determination of whether to include estimated amounts of consideration in the transaction price are based on information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction and the specific facts and circumstances of each arrangement. Additionally, management performs periodic analyses to verify the accuracy of estimates for variable consideration.\nSaaS clinical analytics subscriptions include the right to use our proprietary hosted technology on a SaaS basis, training and member support to deliver improvements in cost management, quality and safety, value-based care and provider analytics. SaaS arrangements create a single performance obligation for each subscription within the contract in which the nature of the obligation is a stand-ready obligation, and each day of service meets the criteria for over time recognition. Pricing varies by application and size of healthcare system. Clinical analytics subscriptions are generally three- to five-year agreements with automatic renewal clauses and annual price escalators that typically do not allow for early termination. These agreements do not allow for physical possession of the software. Subscription fees are typically billed on a monthly basis and revenue is recognized as a single deliverable on a\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest decreased by $13.2 million, or 8%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to a decrease in non-controlling ownership interest percentage in Premier LP to 41% from 51%.\nPerformance Obligations\nWe, through our GPO programs, aggregate member purchasing power to negotiate pricing discounts and improve contract terms with suppliers. Contracted suppliers pay us administrative fees which generally represent 1% to 3% of the purchase price of goods and services sold to members under the contracts we have negotiated. Administrative fees are variable consideration and are recognized as earned based upon estimated purchases by our members utilizing analytics based on historical member spend and updates for current trends and expectations. Administrative fees are estimated due to the difference in timing of when a member purchases on a supplier contract and when we receive the purchasing information. Member and supplier contracts substantiate persuasive evidence of an arrangement. We do not take title to the underlying equipment or products purchased by members through our GPO supplier contracts. Administrative fee revenue receivable is included in contract assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCost of services revenue remained flat during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. Cost of services revenue decreased by $4.6 million, or 95%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to the impact of revenue recognition under the New Revenue Standard on the recognition of costs associated with our partnership with a third party to provide pharmacy benefit management services,\nIn addition to the trends in the U.S. healthcare market discussed above, we face known and unknown uncertainties arising from the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") and the resulting global pandemic and financial and operational uncertainty, including its impact on the overall economy, our sales, operations and supply chains, our members, workforce and suppliers, and countries. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and potential future pandemic outbreaks, we face significant risks including, but not limited to:\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA, Segment Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income and Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA assist our Board of Directors, management and investors in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period because they remove the impact of earnings elements attributable to our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization), certain items outside the control of our management team, e.g. taxes, other non-cash items (such as impairment of intangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments and stock-based compensation), non-recurring items (such as strategic and financial restructuring expenses) and income and expense that has been classified as discontinued operations from our operating results. We believe Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income and Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share assist our Board of Directors, management and investors in comparing our net income and earnings per share on a consistent basis from period to period because these measures remove non-cash (such as impairment of intangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments and stock-based compensation), non-recurring items (such as strategic and financial restructuring expenses), and eliminate the variability of non-controlling interest that results from member owner exchanges of Class B common units for shares of Class A common stock. We believe Free Cash Flow is an important measure because it represents the cash that we generate after payment of tax distributions to limited partners and capital investment to maintain existing products and services and ongoing business operations, as well as development of new and upgraded products and services to support future growth. Our Free Cash Flow allows us to enhance stockholder value through acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures, investments in related businesses and debt reduction.\n\nSome of the limitations of the Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income and Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share measures are that they do not reflect income tax expense or income tax payments we are required to make. In addition, Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income and Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share are not measures of profitability under GAAP.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nRevenue Recognition\nAdjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are supplemental financial measures used by us and by external users of our financial statements and are considered to be indicators of the operational strength and performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow measures allow us to assess our performance without regard to financing methods and capital structure and without the impact of other matters that we do not consider indicative of the operating performance of our business. More specifically, Segment Adjusted EBITDA is the primary earnings measure we use to evaluate the performance of our business segments.\nOperating expenses decreased by $1.2 million, or 1%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to a decrease of $1.2 million in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nA performance obligation is a promise to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Contracts may have a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer individual goods or services is not separately identifiable from other promises, and therefore, not distinct, while other contracts may have multiple performance obligations, most commonly due to the contract covering multiple deliverable arrangements (licensing fees, implementation fees, subscription fees, professional fees for consulting services, etc.).\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $1.8 million, or 1%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018, primarily driven by decreased salaries and benefits and travel expenses, partially offset by increased depreciation of purchased software and hardware.\nThe following table presents our results of operations for the fiscal years presented (in thousands, except per share data):\nAmortization of Purchased Intangible Assets\nRevenue from performance improvement collaboratives and other service subscriptions that support our offerings in cost management, quality and safety, and value-based care is recognized over the service period as the services are provided, which is generally one year. Performance improvement collaboratives and other services subscriptions revenue is considered one performance obligation and is generated by providing customers access to online communities whereby data is housed and available for analytics and benchmarking.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $93.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase of $70.8 million in cash paid for business acquisitions in the current year compared to cash paid for business acquisitions in the prior year. This increase was partially offset by lower proceeds received during the current year of $19.1 million due to the liquidation of property and equipment in connection with our exit from specialty pharmacy operations in June 2019.\nProduct Revenue\nMember-Owner TRA\nstraight-line basis over the remaining contractual period following implementation. Implementation involves the completion of data preparation services that are unique to each member's data set and, in certain cases, the installation of member site-specific software, in order to access and transfer member data into our hosted SaaS clinical analytics products. Implementation is generally 60 to 240 days following contract execution before the SaaS clinical analytics products can be fully utilized by the member.\nCost of product revenue consists of purchase and shipment costs for direct sourced medical products. Our cost of product revenue is influenced by the manufacturing and transportation costs associated with direct sourced medical products.\nNew Accounting Standards\nCorporate\nIncome (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax\nAdjusted EBITDA\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax was $1.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to the substantial completion of the wind down of the specialty pharmacy business.\nSegment Results\n \u2022 The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in a prolonged recession or depression in the United States or globally that could harm the banking system, limit demand for all products and services and cause other seen and unforeseen events and circumstances, all of which could negatively impact us. \nContractual Obligations\nincremental or overall purchasing volume that could, if materially increased, adversely impact our revenues and overall financial performance.\nIncome tax expense decreased by $226.0 million, or 87%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. The decrease was largely driven by the tax expenses recorded in fiscal year 2018 associated with the remeasurement of deferred tax balances related to the reduction in the statutory rate from 35% to 21% as a result of the TCJA. See Note 16 - Income Taxes for more information.\nTotal capitalized labor and research and development expenditures decreased by $1.7 million to $79.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2020. Total capitalized labor and research and development expenditures increased by $4.3 million to $80.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. We experience fluctuations in our research and development expenditures across reportable periods due to the timing of our software development lifecycles, new product features and functionality, new technologies and upgrades to our service offerings.\nConsulting arrangements can require significant estimates for the transaction price and estimated number of hours within an engagement. These estimates are based on the expected value which is derived from outcomes from historical contracts that are similar in nature and forecasted amounts based on anticipated savings for the new agreements. The transaction price is generally constrained until the target transaction price becomes more certain.\n (b) On August 10, 2020, Premier exercised its right to terminate the TRA providing all former limited partners a notice of the termination and the amount of the expected payment to be made to each former limited partner pursuant to the early termination provisions of the TRA (each such amount an \"Early Termination Payment\") with a determination date of August 10, 2020. The aggregate amount of the Early Termination Payments is approximately $473.5 million. Of that amount, approximately $10.6 million is payable within three business days after the date the Early Termination Payment becomes final, which is expected to be on or about September 15, 2020, to former limited partners that did not elect to execute Unit Exchange Agreements. Pursuant to the Unit Exchange Agreements, the remaining amount payable, approximately $462.9 million in the aggregate, will be paid, without interest, to former limited partners that elected to execute Unit Exchange Agreements in 18 equal quarterly installments commencing during the quarter ended March 31, 2021 and ending in the quarter ending June 30, 2025. \nWe met the criteria for classifying certain assets and liabilities of the specialty pharmacy business as a discontinued operation as of June 30, 2019. Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated, information in this Annual Report has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect continuing operations for all periods presented. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations and Exit Activities to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further information.\nWe define Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income as net income attributable to Premier (i) excluding income or loss from discontinued operations, net, (ii) excluding income tax expense, (iii) excluding the impact of adjustment of redeemable limited partners' capital to redemption amount, (iv) excluding the effect of non-recurring and non-cash items, (v) assuming the exchange of all the Class B common units for shares of Class A common stock, which results in the elimination of non-controlling interest in Premier LP and (vi) reflecting an adjustment for income tax expense on adjusted fully distributed net income before income\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nNet Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interest\n (d) Notes payable are non-interest bearing and represent an aggregate principal amount of $9.2 million owed to departed member owners, generally payable over five years from the respective departure dates. \nMultiple Deliverable Arrangements\nWe generated net revenue, net income from continuing operations and Adjusted EBITDA (a financial measure not determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"Non-GAAP\")) for the periods presented as follows (in thousands):\nIncome Tax Expense\n\nBelow is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. These and other significant accounting policies are set forth under Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for nore information.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $9.6 million, or 7%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 driven by increased expenses associated with acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in employee travel and meeting expenses as a result of the elimination of employee travel due to COVID-19.\nOur Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nProfessional fees for consulting services are sold under contracts, the terms of which vary based on the nature of the engagement. These services typically include general consulting, report-based consulting and cost savings initiatives. Promised services under such consulting engagements are typically not considered distinct and are regularly combined and accounted for as one performance obligation. Fees are billed as stipulated in the contract, and revenue is recognized on a proportional performance method as services are performed or when deliverables are provided. In situations where the contracts have significant contract performance guarantees, the performance guarantees are estimated and accounted for as a form of variable consideration when determining the transaction price. In the event that guaranteed savings levels are not achieved, we may have to perform additional services at no additional charge in order to achieve the guaranteed savings or pay the difference between the savings that were guaranteed and the actual achieved savings. Occasionally, our entitlement to consideration is predicated on the occurrence of an event such as the delivery of a report for which client acceptance is required. However, except for event-driven point-in-time transactions, the majority of services provided within this service line are delivered over time due to the continuous benefit provided to our customers.\nThird party administrator fees for our direct to employer initiative consist of integrated fees for the processing of self-insured health care plan claims. Third party administrator fees are invoiced to customers on a monthly basis and typically collected in that period. Revenue is recognized in the period in which the services have been provided.\nOur Supply Chain Services segment includes one of the largest healthcare group purchasing organization programs (\"GPO\") in the United States, serving acute, non-acute, non-healthcare and alternate sites, supply chain co-management and our direct sourcing activities. We generate revenue in our Supply Chain Services segment from administrative fees received from suppliers based on the total dollar volume of supplies purchased by our members, fees from supply chain co-management and through product sales in connection with our direct sourcing activities.\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nStock-based compensation\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses increased by $14.0 million, or 3%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to driven by an increase of $13.7 million in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nPerformance Services\nStock Repurchase Program\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax represents the net income or loss associated with the sale of certain assets and wind down and exit of the specialty pharmacy business. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations and Exit Activities for further information.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets increased by $2.2 million, or 4%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. Amortization of purchased intangible assets remained flat during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. The variances in the material factors contributing to the changes in consolidated amortization of purchased intangible assets are discussed further in \"Segment Results\" below.\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax was $50.6 million for year ended June 30, 2019 and primarily included the $80.4 million non-cash impairment charge related to an interim assessment of goodwill and other long-lived assets of the specialty pharmacy business that were not sold or did not have an alternative use for impairment. In addition, the loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased due to less revenue generated from the specialty pharmacy business during the current year due to the wind down of the business that was initiated on June 7, 2019. These increases were partially offset by the cash proceeds received from the sale. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations and Exit Activities for more information.\nSeveral valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we typically use the income method. This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows for each asset. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset's life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory or economic barriers to entry. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives.\nWe anticipate lower net administrative fees in fiscal year 2021 due to the amendment and extension of GPO participation agreements and the ongoing impact from COVID-19. However, once the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided and we move into fiscal year 2022, we expect our net administrative fees revenue to grow to the extent our existing members increase the utilization of our contracts and additional members convert to our contract portfolio. Due to competitive market trends, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, requests, at times, to provide existing and prospective members increases in revenue share on\nOther Operating Income\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by $21.5 million, or 4%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 driven by increases of $16.2 million and $5.7 million in Supply Chain Services and Performance Services, respectively, partially offset by a decrease of $0.4 million in Corporate.\nThe following table summarizes corporate expenses and Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal years presented (in thousands):\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nA goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis as well as market-based approaches. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analyses are based on the most recent budget and long-term forecast. The discount rates used in the discounted cash flow analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units. The market comparable approach estimates fair value using market multiples of various financial measures compared to a set of comparable public companies and recent comparable transactions.\nWe define EBITDA as net income before income or loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, interest and investment income, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and amortization of purchased intangible assets. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before merger and acquisition related expenses and non-recurring, non-cash or non-operating items and including equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates. For all Non-GAAP financial measures, we consider non-recurring items to be income or expenses and other items that have not been earned or incurred within the prior two years and are not expected to recur within the next two years. Such items include certain strategic and financial restructuring expenses. Non-operating items include gains or losses on the disposal of assets and interest and investment income or expense.\nPerformance Services\nNet Administrative Fees Revenue\nOur Business Segments\nOur principal source of cash has historically been cash provided by operating activities. From time to time we have used, and expect to use in the future, borrowings under our Credit Facility as a source of liquidity. Our primary cash requirements involve operating expenses, working capital fluctuations, revenue share obligations, tax payments, capital expenditures, dividend payments on our Class A common stock, if and when declared, repurchases of Class A common stock pursuant to stock repurchase programs in place from time to time, acquisitions and related business investments, and other general corporate activities. Our capital expenditures typically consist of internally developed software costs, software purchases and computer hardware purchases.\nSee Note 6 - Fair Value Measurements.\nDirect sourcing generates revenue through products sold to distributors, hospitals and other customers. Revenue is recognized once control of products has been transferred to the customer and is recorded net of discounts and rebates offered to customers. Discounts and rebates are estimated based on contractual terms and historical trends.\nOther services and support revenue increased by $3.7 million, or 43%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due supply chain co-management fees as a result of the asset acquisition of Nexera as well as continued growth in our strategic initiatives.\nOn November 9, 2018, we acquired 100% of the outstanding capital stock in Stanson Health, Inc. (\"Stanson\") for an adjusted purchase price of $55.4 million, giving effect to certain purchase price adjustments provided for in the purchase agreement. Stanson is a SaaS-based provider of clinical decision support tools that are integrated directly into the electronic health record workflow, to help provide real-time, patient-specific best practices at the point of care. Stanson is reported as part of the Performance Services segment. See Note 3 - Business Acquisitions to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further information.\nThe Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among others, limitations on liens, indebtedness, fundamental changes, dispositions, restricted payments and investments. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, Premier GP's consolidated total net leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) may not exceed 3.75 to 1.00 for four consecutive quarters, provided that, in connection with any acquisition for which the aggregate consideration exceeds $250.0 million, the maximum consolidated total net leverage ratio may increase to 4.25 to 1.00 for the four consecutive fiscal quarters beginning with the quarter in which such acquisition is completed. In addition, Premier GP must maintain a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) of 2.50 to 1.00 at the end of every fiscal quarter. Premier GP was in compliance with all such covenants at June 30, 2020.\nThe other key business metrics we consider are EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Segment Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income, Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share and Free Cash Flow, which are all Non-GAAP financial measures.\n \u2022 The global supply chain has been significantly disrupted due to stay at home orders, border closings and rapidly escalating shipping costs. \nAmortization of Purchased Intangible Assets\nDespite the importance of these Non-GAAP financial measures in analyzing our business, determining compliance with certain financial covenants in our Credit Facility, measuring and determining incentive compensation and evaluating our operating performance relative to our competitors, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Segment Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income, Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share and Free Cash Flow are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, may have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, net income, net cash provided by operating activities, or any other measure of our performance derived in accordance with GAAP.\nThe adjustment to TRA liabilities for the year ended June 30, 2020 is primarily attributable to increases in the Premier, Inc. effective tax rate related to state tax liabilities (see Note 16 - Income Taxes). The adjustment to TRA liabilities for the year ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to the 14% decrease in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, which occurred as a result of the TCJA that was enacted on December 22, 2017.\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nSelling, general and administrative expenses are directly associated with selling and administrative functions and support of revenue-generating activities including expenses to support and maintain our software-related products and services. Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation and benefits related costs, travel-related expenses, business development expenses, including costs for business acquisition opportunities, business disposition related expenses, indirect costs such as insurance, professional fees and other general overhead expenses, and amortization of certain contract costs. Amortization of contract costs represent amounts that have been capitalized and reflect the incremental costs of obtaining and fulfilling a contract. Amortization of contract costs included within selling, general and administrative expenses include sales commissions.\nProduct Revenue\nAcquisition of Stanson\nNet Revenue\nguaranty of all obligations under the Credit Facility by Premier GP, certain domestic subsidiaries of Premier GP and future guarantors, if any. Premier, Inc. is not a guarantor under the Credit Facility.\nOther services and support revenue increased by $0.7 million, or 10%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. Growth in service fees from our strategic initiatives of $5.4 million was offset by the impact of revenue recognition under the New Revenue Standard related to our partnership with a third party to provide pharmacy benefit management services.\nPremier LP, along with its consolidated subsidiaries, PSCI and PHSI, as Co-Borrowers, Premier GP and certain domestic subsidiaries of Premier GP, as guarantors, entered into an unsecured Credit Facility, dated as of November 9, 2018. The Credit Facility has a maturity date of November 9, 2023, subject to up to two one-year extensions at the request of the Co-Borrowers and approval of a majority of the lenders under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility provides for borrowings of up to $1.0 billion with (i) a $50.0 million sub-facility for standby letters of credit and (ii) a $100.0 million sub-facility for swingline loans. The Credit Facility also provides that Co-Borrowers may from time to time (i) incur incremental term loans and (ii) request an increase in the revolving commitments under the Credit Facility, together up to an aggregate of $350.0 million, subject to the approval of the lenders providing such term loans or revolving commitment increase. The Credit Facility includes an unconditional and irrevocable\nOn February 28, 2020, we, through two newly formed consolidated subsidiaries, Prince A Purchaser, LLC (\"PAP\") and Prince N Purchaser, LLC (\"PNP\"), acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Acurity, Inc. and Nexera, Inc., both indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Greater New York Hospital Association (\"GNYHA\"), for an aggregate amount of $291.5 million, of which $166.1 million was paid at closing with borrowings under our Credit Facility. Pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement (as amended, the \"Purchase Agreement\"), an additional $120.0 million will be paid to the sellers in four equal annual installments of $30.0 million on or about June 30, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024. An additional $5.4 million is expected to be paid during our first fiscal quarter of 2021. In addition to the aggregate amount of $291.5 million, the Purchase Agreement provides a graduated earn-out opportunity to Acurity, Inc. of up to $30.0 million based upon our achievement of a range of member renewals on terms to be agreed to by us and GNYHA based on prevailing market conditions in December 2023.\n (b) Reflects impact of dilutive shares, primarily attributable to the assumed conversion of all Class B common units for Class A common stock.  Consolidated Results - Comparison of the Years Ended June 30, 2020 to 2019 and June 30, 2019 to 2018\nWe had TRA liabilities of $293.7 million and $344.1 million as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The change in TRA liabilities was driven by $90.1 million attributable to member departures, $24.6 million in TRA remeasurements primarily due to the change in North Carolina state income tax law and $17.5 million in TRA payments during the year ended June 30, 2020. These changes were partially offset by an increase of $81.7 million in connection with the quarterly member owner exchanges that occurred during the year ended June 30, 2020.\nOther operating income includes the adjustment to TRA liabilities. Changes in estimated TRA liabilities that are the result of a change in tax accounting method, including the impacts of the TCJA, are recorded as a component of other operating income in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Changes in estimated TRA liabilities that are related to new basis changes as a result of the exchange of Class B common units for a like number of shares of Class A common stock or as a result of departed member owners are recorded as an increase or decrease to additional paid-in capital in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity (Deficit). See \"Income Tax Expense\" below for additional information.\nAfter the closing of the transaction, we changed the names of PAP and PNP to Acurity, LLC (\"Acurity\") and Nexera, LLC (\"Nexera\"), respectively. Acurity is a regional group purchasing organization and has been a customer and strategic partner of ours for more than 24 years. Nexera is a hospital financial improvement consulting firm which partners with healthcare organizations to improve hospital and health system performance, with a significant focus on supply chain enhancement and transformation. We report the operations of Acurity and Nexera as part of the Supply Chain Services segment. See Note 3 - Business Acquisitions to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further information.\nOn May 4, 2020, we, through our consolidated subsidiary Premier Healthcare Solutions, Inc. (\"PHSI\"), acquired 97% of the equity of Health Design Plus, LLC (\"HDP\") for an adjusted purchase price of $24.0 million, giving effect to certain purchase price adjustments provided for in the purchase agreement. The transaction was funded with borrowings under our Credit Facility (as defined in Note 10 - Debt to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements). HDP is a third-party administrator and arranges care for employees through its Centers of Excellence program. Shortly after closing, HDP was renamed Contigo Health,\n (a) Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations excludes the impact of the prepaid administrative fee share for one-time rebates paid by Acurity, Inc. to certain of its then members, as agreed to by Acurity, Inc. prior to entering into the Purchase Agreement and the net change in the aforementioned prepaid administrative fee share capitalized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2020.  Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow decreased by $76.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to a decrease of $84.8 million in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations driven by prepayments for commodity products in response to increased demand due to COVID-19, partially offset by a decrease of $8.9 million in distributions to limited partners of Premier LP.\nMarket and Industry Trends and Outlook\n \u2022 Overall economic and capital markets decline. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in a prolonged recession or depression in the United States or globally that could harm the banking system, limit demand for all products and services and cause other seen and unforeseen events and circumstances, all of which could negatively impact us. The continued spread of COVID-19 has led to and could continue to lead to severe disruption and volatility in the United States and global capital markets, which could increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets in the future. In addition, trading prices on the public stock market, including our Class A common stock, have been highly volatile as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nNet administrative fees revenue increased $8.1 million, or 1%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. Growth in net administrative fees revenue was primarily due to continuing contract penetration driven largely by the company's high-compliance portfolio programs and the addition of new contract categories and suppliers. The growth in net administrative fees was largely offset by the impact of COVID-19 during the three months ended June 30, 2020, which significantly impacted full year growth.\nA summary of net cash flows follows (in thousands):\nWe also urge you to review the reconciliation of these Non-GAAP financial measures included elsewhere in this Annual Report. To properly and prudently evaluate our business, we encourage you to review the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report, and to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. In addition, because the EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Segment Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income, Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share and Free Cash Flow measures are susceptible to varying calculations, such Non-GAAP financial measures may differ from, and may therefore not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nOperating expenses increased by $24.3 million during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to an increase of $20.9 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, an increase of $2.2 million in amortization of intangible assets and an increase of $1.2 million in research and development expenses.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCost of services revenue in our Performance Services segment decreased by $0.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. An increase in amortization of internally developed software applications was offset by a decrease in salaries and benefits in the current year due to lower headcount as a result of staffing efficiencies implemented in the prior year and a decrease due to the impact of the New Revenue Standard on the recognition of certain consulting expenses which were historically recognized on a gross basis under the Previous Revenue Standard, but are now recognized on a net basis under the New Revenue Standard.\nWe record tax receivable agreement (\"TRA\") liabilities based on 85% of the estimated amount of tax savings we expect to receive, generally over a 15-year period, in connection with the additional tax benefits created in conjunction with the initial public offering (\"IPO\"). Absent a TRA Termination Event, tax payments under the TRA will be made to the member owners as we realize tax benefits attributable to the initial purchase of Class B common units from the member owners made concurrently with the IPO and any subsequent exchanges of Class B common units into Class A common stock or cash between us and the member owners. Determining the estimated amount of tax savings we expect to receive requires judgment as deductibility of goodwill amortization expense is not assured and the estimate of tax savings is dependent upon the actual realization of the tax benefit and the tax rates in effect at that time.\n \u2022 Limited access to our members' facilities that impacts our ability to fulfill our contractual requirements. Our member hospitals and non-acute care sites have experienced reduced or limited access for non-patients, including our field teams, consultants and other professionals, and travel restrictions have impacted our employees' ability to travel to our members' facilities. The long-term continuation, or any future recurrence of these circumstances may negatively impact the ability of our employees to more effectively deliver existing or sell new products and services to our members and could affect our performance of our existing contracts. \nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest decreased by $49.3 million, or 22%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to a decrease in non-controlling ownership interest percentage in Premier LP to 51% from 60%, as well as a decrease in Premier LP net income, which was largely driven by the increased loss from discontinued operations, net of tax in the current year.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nWe enter into agreements where the individual deliverables discussed above, such as SaaS subscriptions and consulting services, are bundled into a single service arrangement. These agreements are generally provided over a time period ranging from approximately three months to five years after the applicable contract execution date. Revenue, including both fixed and variable consideration, is allocated to the individual performance obligations within the arrangement based on the stand-alone selling price when it is sold separately in a stand-alone arrangement.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAt our option, committed loans may be in the form of Eurodollar rate loans (\"Eurodollar Loans\") or base rate loans (\"Base Rate Loans\"). Eurodollar Loans bear interest at the Eurodollar rate (defined as the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus the Applicable Rate (defined as a margin based on the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility))). Base Rate Loans bear interest at the Base Rate (defined as the highest of the prime rate announced by the administrative agent, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, the one-month LIBOR plus 1.0% and 0.0%) plus the Applicable Rate. The Applicable Rate ranges from 1.000% to 1.500% for Eurodollar Loans and 0.000% to 0.500% for Base Rate Loans. In the event that LIBOR is no longer available, the Credit Facility states that interest will be calculated based upon rates offered to leading banks for comparable loans by leading banks in the London interbank market. At June 30, 2020, the interest rate for one-month Eurodollar Loans was 1.162% and the interest rate for Base Rate Loans was 3.250%. The Co-Borrowers are required to pay a commitment fee ranging from 0.100% to 0.200% per annum on the actual daily unused amount of commitments under the Credit Facility. At June 30, 2020, the commitment fee was 0.100%.\nProduct revenue increased by $85.8 million, or 47%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by the aggregated purchasing of personal protective equipment as a result of COVID-19 and growth in commodity products and aggregated purchasing of certain products.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOn May 7, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300.0 million of our outstanding Class A common stock during fiscal year 2020. During fiscal year 2020, we purchased an aggregate of 4.6 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $32.28 per share for a total purchase price of $150.0 million under our fiscal year 2020 stock repurchase program. On August 5, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.19 per share, payable on September 15, 2020 to stockholders of record on September 1, 2020.\nSupply Chain Services segment cost of revenue increased by $71.5 million, or 41%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019, and increased by $14.0 million, or 9%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018.\nDuring the second half of fiscal 2020, COVID-19 became a global pandemic that spread throughout the United States and much of the rest of the world. In addition to those who have been directly affected with the disease, millions more have been affected by government and voluntary efforts around the world to slow the spread of the pandemic through quarantines, travel restrictions, business shut-downs, heightened border security and other measures. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, the actions to contain it or treat its impact, including the timing, development and deployment of an effective vaccine, or recurrences of COVID-19 or similar pandemics. As discussed in detail under \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" above, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and potential future pandemic outbreaks, we face significant risks including but not limited to the following:\n\nThe variances in the material factors contributing to the changes in consolidated net revenue are discussed further in \"Segment Results\" below.\nSupply Chain Services revenue consists of GPO net administrative fees (gross administrative fees received from suppliers, reduced by the amount of any revenue share paid to members), supply chain co-management and direct sourcing revenue.\nGain or loss on FFF put and call rights\n\nProceeds from borrowings under the Credit Facility may generally be used to finance ongoing working capital requirements, including permitted acquisitions, cash dividends, if and when declared, repurchases of Class A common stock pursuant to stock repurchase programs, in place from time to time, and other general corporate activities. We had $75.0 million outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility at June 30, 2020 with $925.0 million of available borrowing capacity after reductions for outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit. On July 31, 2020, we repaid $25.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility.\nOperating expenses increased by $21.5 million, or 13%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to an increase of $16.1 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and an increase of $5.4 million in intangible asset amortization.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table provides the reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to stockholders to Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income and the reconciliation of the numerator and denominator for earnings per share attributable to stockholders to Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share for the periods presented (in thousands). Refer to \"Our Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for further information regarding items excluded in our calculation of Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income and Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share.\nOn June 7, 2019, we completed the sale of prescription files and records and certain other assets used in our specialty pharmacy business for $22.3 million. We also received $7.6 million related to the sale of a portion of our pharmaceutical inventory on June 10, 2019, and an additional $3.6 million on July 24, 2019 primarily in connection with the sale of our remaining pharmaceutical inventory. In addition, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, we had substantially completed the wind down and exit from the specialty pharmacy business. We recognized non-cash impairment charges of $80.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2019 related to goodwill, purchased intangibles and other assets of the specialty pharmacy business that were not sold or did not have an alternative use.\n\nGoodwill\nrequired to perform a quantitative assessment to determine whether or not goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if any.\nNet administrative fees revenue increased by $18.6 million, or 3%, during the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ended June 30, 2018, due in part to the impact of revenue recognition under the New Revenue Standard. Net administrative fees recognized in the year ended June 30, 2019 under the Previous Revenue Standard increased $10.5 million, or 2%, over the prior year. Growth was primarily due to further contract penetration of existing members and, to a lesser degree, the impact of conversion of new members to our portfolio, partially offset by higher revenue recoveries in the prior year.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $16.1 million, or 11%, during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019 driven by increased expenses associated with current year acquisitions and expenses associated with our strategic initiatives. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in employee travel and meeting expenses as a result of the elimination of employee travel due to COVID-19.\nResults of operations for all periods
