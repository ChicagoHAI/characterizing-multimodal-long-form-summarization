Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. This MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included in Item 8. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our results and the timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nAshford Inc. is a Maryland corporation that provides asset management services, advisory services and other products and services primarily to clients in the hospitality industry. We became a public company in November 2014, when Ashford Trust completed the spin-off of Ashford Inc. through the distribution of approximately 70% of our outstanding common stock to Ashford Trust stockholders and unitholders in Ashford Trust's operating partnership, collectively. Our common stock is listed on the NYSE American. As of March 6, 2019, Ashford Trust held approximately 598,000 shares of our common stock which represented an approximate 24.2% ownership interest in Ashford Inc. and Braemar held approximately 195,000 shares, which represented an approximate 7.9% ownership interest in Ashford Inc.\nWe are currently the advisor for Ashford Trust and Braemar. In our capacity as the advisor to Ashford Trust and Braemar, we are responsible for implementing the investment strategies and managing the day-to-day operations of Ashford Trust and Braemar, in each case subject to the supervision and oversight of the respective board of directors of Ashford Trust and Braemar. Ashford Trust commenced operating in August 2003 and is focused on investing in full service hotels in the upscale and upper-upscale segments in the U.S. that have RevPAR generally less than twice the national average. Braemar invests primarily in luxury hotels and resorts with RevPAR of at least twice the U.S. national average. Braemar became a publicly traded company in November 2013 upon the completion of its spin-off from Ashford Trust. Each of Ashford Trust and Braemar is a REIT as defined in the Internal Revenue Code, and the common stock of each of Ashford Trust and Braemar is traded on the NYSE.\nWe provide the personnel and services that we believe are necessary to assist each of Ashford Trust and Braemar in conducting their respective businesses. We may also perform similar functions for new or additional platforms. We are not responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the individual hotel properties owned by either Ashford Trust or Braemar, which duties are, and will continue to be, the responsibility of the hotel management companies that operate the hotel properties owned by Ashford Trust and Braemar.\nWe conduct our advisory business primarily through an operating entity, Ashford LLC, our project management business through an operating entity, Premier, and our hospitality products and services business primarily through an operating entity, Ashford Services. We own substantially all of our assets and conduct substantially all of our business through Ashford LLC, Premier, and Ashford Services.\nAs required for disclosure under the Fifth Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement (the Fifth Amended and Restated Braemar Advisory Agreement\u201d), for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2018, the total incremental expenses incurred (including all reimbursable expenses), as reasonably determined, in connection with providing services to Braemar under the Fifth Amended and Restated Braemar Advisory Agreement was $10.2 million.\nRecent Developments\nOn January 2, 2018, the Company issued 8,962 shares of common stock to the OpenKey redeemable noncontrolling interest holder in connection with the purchase of 519,647 shares of the outstanding Class B common stock in OpenKey, Inc. The common stock was issued pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements under the Securities Act provided under Section 4(a)(2) thereunder.\nOn January 16, 2018, the Company closed on the acquisition of a passenger vessel and other assets related to RED Hospitality & Leisure LLC (\"RED\"), a provider of watersports activities and other travel and transportation services. The Company paid $970,000 cash, comprised of a $750,000 deposit paid on December 11, 2017, which was reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as other assets\u201d as of December 31, 2017, and an additional $220,000 paid on January 16, 2018. This transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition recorded at cost, and did not result in the recognition of goodwill. During 2018, our RED operating subsidiary acquired additional passenger vessels for $2.4 million, a ferry for $2.5 million and paid a $400,000 deposit for a new passenger vessel. The Company owns an 80% interest in RED.\nOn March 12, 2018, the Board of Directors of Ashford Inc. appointed Mr. J. Robison Hays, III, as Co-President and Chief\nStrategy Officer of the Company, appointed Mr. Jeremy J. Welter as Co-President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, and appointed David A. Brooks as Chief Transactions Officer, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company, effective March 12, 2018. Also on March 12, 2018, Mr. Douglas A. Kessler ceased to serve as the Company's President and was appointed to serve as Senior Managing Director of the Company, and Mr. David A. Brooks ceased to serve as the Company's Chief Operating Officer.\nOn March 1, 2018, the Company and its subsidiary Ashford Hospitality Holdings LLC entered into a $35 million senior revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. The credit facility provides for a three-year revolving line of credit and bears interest at the Base Rate plus 2.00% to 2.50% or LIBOR plus 3.00% to 3.50%, depending on the leverage level of the Company. There is a one-year extension option subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The new credit facility includes the opportunity to expand the borrowing capacity by up to $40 million to an aggregate amount of $75 million, subject to certain conditions. At December 31, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility.\nOn March 21, 2018, Ashford Inc. entered into the First Amendment (the Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement dated March 1, 2018 (the Credit Facility\u201d), with Ashford Hospitality Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of Ashford Inc., Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and letters of credit issuer, and the lenders from time to time party thereto. The Amendment is effective as of March 1, 2018, which is the date the Credit Facility became effective. Pursuant to the Amendment, the financial covenant of consolidated tangible net worth was replaced with consolidated net worth, and Ashford Inc. is required to maintain consolidated net worth not less than 75% of the consolidated net worth as of December 31, 2017, plus 75% of the net equity proceeds of any future equity issuances by Ashford Inc.\nOn March 23, 2018, our RED operating subsidiary entered into a term loan of $750,000 and a revolving credit facility of $250,000 for which the creditor has recourse to Ashford Inc. Approximately $225,000 of the proceeds from the term loan are held in an escrow account, which is included in our consolidated balance sheet within other assets\u201d as of December 31, 2018. The term loan bears interest at the Prime Rate plus 1.75% and matures on April 5, 2025. The revolving credit facility bears interest at the Prime Rate plus 1.75% and matures on March 5, 2019.\nOn April 2, 2018, Ashford Inc. announced the death of long-time executive David A. Brooks, who served in multiple leadership roles with the Company since 2003.\nOn April 4, 2018, the Board of Directors of Ashford Inc. approved the updated form of Amended and Restated Indemnification Agreement to be entered into by the Company and each of its directors and officers.\nOn April 6, 2018, Ashford Inc. signed a definitive agreement to acquire the project management business of Remington Holdings, L.P. ( Remington\u201d).\nOn April 23, 2018, in connection with the name change by Braemar, the Company entered into the Fifth Amended and Restated Braemar Advisory Agreement, which amends the prior amended and restated advisory agreement only to reflect the name change and does not amend or otherwise alter the rights of any of the parties thereto.\nOn June 1, 2018, the board of directors of the Company appointed Mr. Robert G. Haiman as Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company, effective June 1, 2018.\nOn June 25, 2018, Ashford Inc. announced that it was added as a member of the U.S. small-cap Russell 2000\u00ae Index and the U.S. broad-market Russell 3000\u00ae Index at the conclusion of the Russell indexes annual reconstitution, effective after the market closed on June 22, 2018.\nOn June 26, 2018, the Company entered into the Enhanced Return Funding Program Agreement and Amendment No. 1 to the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement (the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement\u201d) with Ashford Trust. The independent members of the board of directors of each of the Company and Ashford Trust, with the assistance of separate and independent legal counsel, engaged to negotiate the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement on behalf of the Company and Ashford Trust, respectively. Under the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement, the Company agreed to provide $50 million to Ashford Trust in connection with Ashford Trust's acquisition of hotels recommended by us, with the option to increase the funding commitment to up to $100 million upon mutual agreement by the parties. The Company is obligated to provide Ashford Trust 10% of the acquired hotel's purchase price in exchange for FF&E, which is subsequently leased to Ashford Trust rent-free. The Company records ERFP obligations in our consolidated balance sheet as other assets\u201d and other liabilities.\u201d Ashford Trust must provide reasonable advance notice to the Company to request ERFP funds in accordance with the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement. The Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement requires that the Company acquire the related FF&E either at the time of the property acquisition or at any time generally within two years of Ashford Trust acquiring the hotel property. The Company recognizes the related depreciation tax deduction at the time such FF&E is purchased by the Company and placed into service at Ashford Trust properties. However, the timing of the FF&E being purchased and placed into service is subject to uncertainties outside of the Company's control that could delay the realization of any tax benefit associated with the purchase of FF&E. See notes 11 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOn June 29, 2018, Ashford Trust acquired the Hilton Old Town Alexandria in Alexandria, Virginia, for a purchase price of $111.0 million. In connection with Ashford Trust's acquisition of the hotel, the Company was obligated to provide Ashford Trust with approximately $11.1 million in exchange for FF&E for use at Ashford Trust properties, in each case subject to the terms of the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had paid Ashford Trust $11.1 million of cash in exchange for FF&E that was subsequently leased back to Ashford Trust rent-free under the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement.\nOn August 7, 2018, at a Special Meeting of Stockholders, Ashford Inc. shareholders voted to approve certain matters related to Ashford Inc.'s acquisition of the project management business of Remington, including the issuance of 8,120,000 shares of Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock\u201d).\nOn August 8, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Premier, the project management business formerly conducted by certain affiliates of Remington, for a total transaction value of $203 million. As a result, the project management services that were previously provided by Remington Lodging & Hospitality, LLC, ( Remington Lodging\u201d) are now provided by a subsidiary of Ashford Inc. under the respective project management agreement with each customer, including Ashford Trust and Braemar. The purchase price was paid by issuing 8,120,000 shares of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to the sellers of Premier (the Remington Sellers\u201d), primarily MJB Investments, LP (which is wholly-owned by Monty J. Bennett, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our board of directors), and his father Archie Bennett, Jr., the Chairman Emeritus of Ashford Trust (together, the Bennetts\u201d). The Series B Convertible Preferred Stock has a conversion price of $140 per share and would convert into 1,450,000 shares of our common stock. Dividends on the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock are payable at an annual rate of 5.5% in the first year, 6.0% in the second year, and 6.5% in the third year and each year thereafter. In addition to certain separate class voting rights, the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock vote on an as-converted basis with the holders of the common stock on all matters submitted for approval by the holders of our capital stock possessing general voting rights. However, for five years following the closing of the acquisition of Premier, the Remington Sellers and their transferees are subject to certain voting restrictions with respect to shares in excess of 25% of the combined voting power of the Company's outstanding capital stock. The holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock have certain conversion rights upon certain events constituting a change of control of the Company. See note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn connection with the acquisition, on August 8, 2018, Ashford Inc. and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as Rights Agent, entered into a new Rights Agreement. Pursuant to the Rights Agreement, each Right initially entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series C Preferred Stock of the Company at a price of $275 per one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share represented by a Right, subject to adjustment (each as defined under the Rights Agreement). The Amended and Restated Rights Agreement of Ashford Inc. in effect prior to the acquisition of Premier is no longer in effect.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Premier, we effected a holding company reorganization. The change in holding company organizational structure was effected by a merger, pursuant to which each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of our predecessor publicly-traded parent Ashford OAINC Inc. (formerly named Ashford Inc.) ( Old Ashford\u201d) was converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company having the same rights, powers and preferences and the same qualifications, limitations and restrictions as a share of common stock of Old Ashford. As a result of the foregoing, we became the successor issuer of Old Ashford under Rule 12g-3 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act\u201d). Our common stock continues to be listed on the NYSE American under the symbol AINC.\u201d\nOn August 31, 2018, our RED operating subsidiary entered into a term loan of $1.8 million for which the creditor has recourse to Ashford Inc. The term loan bears interest at the Prime Rate plus 2.00% and matures on February 1, 2029.\nOn September 28, 2018, we completed a public offering of 270,000 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $74.50 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $20.1 million. The net proceeds from the sale of the shares after discounts and commissions to the underwriters and offering expenses were approximately $18.2 million. We also sold an additional 10,000 shares of common stock to the underwriters on October 10, 2018, in connection with the underwriters' partial exercise of their over-allotment option that had been granted to them in connection with the transaction. The net proceeds from the sale of the over-allotment shares after discounts and commissions to the underwriters were approximately $700,000.\nOn October 31, 2018, Ashford Trust acquired the La Posada de Santa Fe ( La Posada\u201d) in Santa Fe, New Mexico, for a purchase price of $50 million. In connection with Ashford Trust's acquisition of the hotel, the Company was obligated to provide Ashford Trust with approximately $5.0 million in exchange for FF&E for use at Ashford Trust properties, in each case subject to the terms of the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had paid Ashford Trust $5.0 million of cash in exchange for FF&E that was subsequently leased back to Ashford Trust rent-free under the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement.\nOn November 8, 2018, OpenKey renewed the Loan and Security Agreement that expired in October 2018 for a revolving credit facility in the amount of $1.5 million. The credit facility is secured by all of OpenKey's assets and matures on April 30, 2020, with an interest rate of Prime Rate plus 2.75%. Creditors do not have recourse to Ashford Inc. At December 31, 2018 and\n2017, there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility. In connection with the 2018 renewal, OpenKey granted the creditors a 10-year warrant to purchase approximately 23,000 shares of OpenKey's preferred stock at $1.61 per share with an estimated fair value of $26,000. The fair value of the warrants was recorded in noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities and debt issuance costs, which is amortized over the term of the line of credit.\nEffective January 1, 2019, we acquired a 30% noncontrolling ownership interest in Real Estate Advisory Holdings LLC (\"REA Holdings\"), a real estate advisory firm that provides financing, advisory and property sales services primarily to clients in the hospitality and leisure industry, for a purchase price of approximately $3.0 million which was paid in the form of $2.1 million cash and the issuance of 16,529 shares of our common stock (approximately $890,000) to the seller pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements under the Securities Act, provided under Section 4(a)(2) thereunder. We have an option to acquire an additional 50% of the ownership interests in REA Holdings for $12.5 million beginning on January 1, 2022. Our investment in REA Holdings is accounted for under the equity method as we have significant influence over the voting interest entity.\nOn January 15, 2019, the Company entered into the Enhanced Return Funding Program Agreement and Amendment No. 1 to the Fifth Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement (the Braemar ERFP Agreement\u201d) with Braemar. The independent members of the board of directors of each of the Company and Braemar, with the assistance of separate and independent legal counsel, engaged to negotiate the Braemar ERFP Agreement on behalf of the Company and Braemar, respectively. Under the Braemar ERFP Agreement, the Company agreed to provide $50 million to Braemar in connection with Braemar's acquisition of hotels recommended by us, with the option to increase the funding commitment to up to $100 million upon mutual agreement by the parties. Under the Braemar ERFP Agreement, the Company is obligated to provide Braemar 10% of the acquired hotel's purchase price in exchange for FF&E, which is subsequently leased by the Company to Braemar rent-free. In connection with Braemar's acquisition of The Ritz-Carlton Lake Tahoe on January 15, 2019, the Company is obligated to provide Braemar with approximately $10.3 million in exchange for FF&E at Braemar properties, subject to the terms of the Braemar ERFP Agreement.\nOn January 22, 2019, Ashford Trust acquired The Embassy Suites New York Midtown Manhattan for a purchase price of $195.0 million. In connection with Ashford Trust's acquisition of the hotel, the Company is obligated to provide Ashford Trust with approximately $19.5 million in exchange for FF&E at Ashford Trust's hotel properties that will subsequently be leased back to Ashford Trust rent-free under the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement.\nOn February 26, 2019, Ashford Trust acquired the Hilton Santa Cruz/Scotts Valley, in Santa Cruz, California, for a purchase price of $50.0 million. In connection with Ashford Trust's acquisition of the hotel, the Company is obligated to provide Ashford Trust with approximately $5.0 million in exchange for FF&E at Ashford Trust's hotel properties that will subsequently be leased back to Ashford Trust rent-free under the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement.\nOn February 28, 2019, our RED operating subsidiary renewed its revolving credit facility for which the creditor has recourse to Ashford Inc. The revolving credit facility provides RED with available borrowings up to a total of $250,000, bears interest at the Prime Rate plus 1.75% and matures on February 5, 2020.\nOn March 1, 2019, J&S, our consolidated subsidiary, acquired a privately-held company that conducts the business of BAV Services in the United States ( BAV\u201d) for approximately $9.0 million. BAV is an audio visual rental, staging, and production company, focused on meeting and special event services. As a result of the acquisition, our ownership interest in J&S, which we consolidate under the voting interest model, increased from 85% to approximately 88%. The purchase price consisted of (i) $5.0 million in cash, funded by an existing term loan; (ii) $4.0 million in the form of Ashford Inc. common stock, consisting of 61,387 shares issued on March 1, 2019, which was determined based on an agreed upon value of $3.5 million using a thirty-day weighted average price per share of $57.01 and had an estimated fair value of $3.9 million on the acquisition date, and additional shares with an estimated fair value of $500,000 to be issued 18 months from the acquisition date, subject to certain conditions; and (iii) contingent consideration up to $3.0 million, payable, if earned, 12 to 18 months from the acquisition date. The results of operations of BAV will be included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition beginning in the first quarter of 2019. We are in the process of evaluating the fair value of the net assets acquired through internal studies and third-party valuations and expect to complete a preliminary purchase price allocation in the first quarter of 2019.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe following table summarizes the changes in key line items from our consolidated

The increase in income tax expense is primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance of our deferred tax asset caused by the legal restructuring of our organizational structure in the second quarter of 2017 and enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017. As a result, our effective tax rates on income (loss) before income taxes for 2017 and 2016 were (92.9%) and (6.7%), respectively.\n(Income) Loss from Consolidated Entities Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests.

For a summary of ownership interests, carrying values and allocations, see notes 2, 14, and 17 to our consolidated financial statements.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary for operating expenses primarily attributable to paying our employees. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations, existing cash balances and, if necessary, short-term borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which we believe will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our existing non-discretionary obligations and anticipated ordinary course operating expenses for at least the next twelve months.\nOur long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for operating expenses attributable to paying our employees, investments to grow our business, and our ERFP and certain recent subsidiary financing transactions noted below. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, including net cash provided by operations, future equity issuances and availability under our revolving credit facilities.\nOn March 1, 2019, J&S, our consolidated subsidiary, acquired a privately-held company that conducts the business of BAV Services in the United States ( BAV\u201d) for approximately $9.0 million. BAV is an audio visual rental, staging, and production company, focused on meeting and special event services. As a result of the acquisition, our ownership interest in J&S, which we consolidate under the voting interest model, increased from 85% to approximately 88%. The purchase price consisted of (i) $5.0 million in cash, funded by an existing term loan; (ii) $4.0 million in the form of Ashford Inc. common stock, consisting of 61,387 shares issued on March 1, 2019, which was determined based on an agreed upon value of $3.5 million using a thirty-day weighted average price per share of $57.01 and had an estimated fair value of $3.9 million on the acquisition date, and additional shares with an estimated fair value of $500,000 to be issued 18 months from the acquisition date, subject to certain conditions; and (iii) contingent consideration up to $3.0 million, payable, if earned, 12 to 18 months from the acquisition date. The results of operations of BAV will be included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition beginning in the first quarter of 2019.

Our investment in REA Holdings is accounted for under the equity method as we have significant influence over the voting interest entity.\nOn November 8, 2018, OpenKey renewed the Loan and Security Agreement that expired in October 2018 for a revolving credit facility in the amount of $1.5 million. The credit facility is secured by all of OpenKey's assets and matures on April 30, 2020, with an interest rate of Prime Rate plus 2.75%. Creditors do not have recourse to Ashford Inc. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility. In connection with the 2018 renewal, OpenKey granted the creditors a 10-year warrant to purchase approximately 23,000 shares of OpenKey's preferred stock at $1.61 per share with an estimated fair value of $26,000. The fair value of the warrants was recorded in noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities and debt issuance costs, which is amortized over the term of the line of credit.

We also sold an additional 10,000 shares of common stock to the underwriters on October 10, 2018, in connection with the underwriters' partial exercise of their over-allotment option that had been granted to them in connection with the transaction. The net proceeds from the sale of the over-allotment shares after discounts and commissions to the underwriters were approximately $700,000.\nOn August 31, 2018, our RED operating subsidiary entered into a term loan of $1.8 million for which the creditor has recourse to Ashford Inc. The term loan bears interest at the Prime Rate plus 2.00% and matures on February 1, 2029.\nOn August 8, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Premier, the project management business formerly conducted by certain affiliates of Remington, for a total transaction value of $203 million. As a result, the project management services that were previously provided by Remington Lodging & Hospitality, LLC, ( Remington Lodging\u201d) are now provided by a subsidiary of Ashford Inc. under the respective project management agreement with each customer, including Ashford Trust and Braemar. The purchase price was paid by issuing 8,120,000 shares of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to the sellers of Premier (the Remington Sellers\u201d), primarily MJB Investments, LP (which is wholly-owned by Monty J. Bennett, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our board of directors), and his father Archie Bennett, Jr., the Chairman Emeritus of Ashford Trust (together, the Bennetts\u201d). The Series B Convertible Preferred Stock has a conversion price of $140 per share and would convert into 1,450,000 shares of our common stock. Dividends on the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock are payable at an annual rate of 5.5% in the first year, 6.0% in the second year, and 6.5% in the third year and each year thereafter. In addition to certain separate class voting rights, the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock vote on an as-converted basis with the holders of the common stock on all matters submitted for approval by the holders of our capital stock possessing general voting rights. However, for five years following the closing of the acquisition of Premier, the Remington Sellers and their transferees are subject to certain voting restrictions with respect to shares in excess of 25% of the combined voting power of the Company's outstanding capital stock. The holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock have certain conversion rights upon certain events constituting a change of control of the Company.\nOn June 26, 2018, the Company entered into the Enhanced Return Funding Program Agreement and Amendment No. 1 to the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement (the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement\u201d) with Ashford Trust. The independent members of the board of directors of each of the Company and Ashford Trust, with the assistance of separate and independent legal counsel, engaged to negotiate the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement on behalf of the Company and Ashford Trust, respectively. Under the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement, the Company agreed to provide $50 million to Ashford Trust in connection with Ashford Trust's acquisition of hotels recommended by us, with the option to increase the funding commitment to up to $100 million upon mutual agreement by the parties. The Company is obligated to provide Ashford Trust 10% of the acquired hotel's purchase price in exchange for FF&E, which is subsequently leased to Ashford Trust rent-free. The Company records ERFP obligations in our consolidated balance sheet as other assets\u201d and other liabilities.\u201d Ashford Trust must provide reasonable advance notice to the Company to request ERFP funds in accordance with the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement. The Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement requires that the Company acquire the related FF&E either at the time of the property acquisition or at any time generally within two years of Ashford Trust acquiring the hotel property. The Company recognizes the related depreciation tax deduction at the time such FF&E is purchased by the Company and placed into service at Ashford Trust properties. However, the timing of the FF&E being purchased and placed into service is subject to uncertainties outside of the Company's control that could delay the realization of any tax benefit associated with the purchase of FF&E. In connection with Ashford Trust's acquisition of the Hilton Old Town Alexandria and La Posada de Santa Fe in 2018, and subject to the terms of the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement, the Company was obligated to provide Ashford Trust with approximately $16.1 million of FF&E at Ashford Trust properties. The $16.1 million of FF&E was purchased and leased to Ashford Trust with an effective date of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had no remaining balance in our ERFP obligation to Ashford Trust in respect of hotels already acquired by Ashford Trust.\nIn connection with Ashford Trust's acquisitions of The Embassy Suites New York Midtown Manhattan on January 22, 2019 and the Hilton Santa Cruz/Scotts Valley on February 26, 2019, the Company is obligated to provide Ashford Trust with approximately $19.5 million and $5.0 million, respectively, for a total obligation of $24.5 million in exchange for FF&E at Ashford Trust properties, subject to the terms of the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement. After consideration of the $16.1 million ERFP obligations funded in 2018 and the $24.5 million ERFP obligations incurred in connection with Ashford Trust's acquisitions in 2019, the Company has $9.4 million remaining of its initial $50 million ERFP funding commitment to Ashford Trust.\nOn March 23, 2018, our RED operating subsidiary entered into a term loan of $750,000 and a revolving credit facility of $250,000 for which the creditor has recourse to Ashford Inc. Approximately $225,000 of the proceeds from the term loan are held in an escrow account, which is included in our consolidated balance sheet within other assets\u201d as of December 31, 2018. The term loan bears interest at the Prime Rate plus 1.75% and matures on April 5, 2025. The revolving credit facility bears interest at the Prime Rate plus 1.75% and matures on March 5, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2018, $118,000 was drawn on the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2018, $132,000 was available under the revolving credit facility.

Pursuant to the Amendment, the financial covenant of consolidated tangible net worth was replaced with the consolidated net worth, and Ashford Inc. is required to maintain consolidated net worth not less than 75% of the consolidated net worth as of December 31, 2017, plus 75% of the net equity proceeds of any future equity issuances by Ashford Inc.\nOn March 1, 2018, the Company and its subsidiary Ashford Hospitality Holdings LLC entered into a $35 million senior revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. The credit facility provides for a three-year revolving line of credit and bears interest at the Base Rate plus 2.00% to 2.50% or LIBOR plus 3.00% to 3.50%, depending on the leverage level of the Company. There is a one-year extension option subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.

Net deferred loan costs associated with this financing of $183,000 and $226,000, respectively, are included as a reduction to notes payable on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. In connection with the term loan, the subsidiary entered into an interest rate cap with an initial notional amount totaling $5.0 million and a strike rate of 4.0%. The fair value of the interest rate cap at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was not material. The subsidiary also entered into a $3.0 million revolving credit facility which bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.25% and matures on November 1, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2018, $21.8 million was drawn and approximately $20.8 million of payments were made on the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2018, approximately $1.3 million of credit was available under the revolving credit facility and approximately $1.7 million was outstanding. These debt agreements contain various financial covenants that, among other things, require the maintenance of certain fixed charge coverage ratios. As of December 31, 2018, our J&S operating subsidiary was in compliance with all financial covenants.\nAlso on November 1, 2017, in connection with the acquisition of J&S, our J&S operating subsidiary entered into a $3.0 million equipment note and a $2.0 million draw term loan agreement. These loans each bear interest at LIBOR plus 3.25% and mature on November 1, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2018, $2.3 million was drawn on the equipment note and $2.0 million was outstanding on the draw term loan. All the loans in connection with the acquisition of J&S are partially secured by a security interest on all of the assets and equity interests of our J&S operating subsidiary.\nOn April 6, 2017, Pure Wellness entered into a term loan of $375,000 and a line of credit of $100,000 for which the creditor does not have recourse to Ashford Inc. The term loan has a fixed interest rate of 5.00% per annum. On October 1, 2018, we paid off the remaining balance on the term loan. The line of credit has a variable interest rate of Prime Rate plus 1.00%. There is no stated maturity date related to the line of credit as it is payable on demand; accordingly, the balance has been classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheets.\nCertain segments of our business are capital intensive and may require additional financing from time to time. Any additional financings, if and when pursued, may not be available on favorable terms or at all, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and capital resources.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $51.5 million and $36.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, respectively, and $7.9 million and $9.1 million of restricted cash, respectively.\nNet Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities. Operating activities provided net cash flows of $21.5 million and $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to an increase in earnings as well as the timing of settlements with related parties and payments to vendors, partially offset by $10.4 million of transaction costs related to the acquisition of Premier, $1.4 million of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of J&S and the timing of operating subsidiaries' receipt of revenues. In connection with our Fourth Amended and Restated Braemar Advisory Agreement, we received a $5.0 million cash payment in June 2017 from Braemar which positively impacted operating cash flows in the year ended December 31, 2017. The higher cash flows provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily a result of the liquidation of investments in securities held by the AQUA U.S. Fund during the year ended December 31, 2016. Cash flows from operations is impacted by\nthe timing of receipt of advisory fees from Ashford Trust and Braemar, timing of paying vendors and timing of operating subsidiaries' receipt of revenues.\nNet Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $28.1 million primarily due to $16.1 million of capital expenditures related to our ERFP agreement with Ashford Trust, $8.9 million of capital expenditures for audio visual equipment and computer software, and $5.5 million of capital expenditures for RED marine vessels, partially offset by $2.3 million of cash acquired in the acquisition of Premier and net proceeds from the disposal of FF&E of $140,000.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $23.2 million, which was attributable to the acquisition of a controlling interest in J&S for $19.0 million (net of cash acquired of approximately $200,000), purchases of computer software and FF&E of $3.6 million, a $750,000 deposit for certain assets related to RED, partially offset by proceeds from the disposal of FF&E of $15,000 and $129,000 of cash acquired in the acquisition of Pure Wellness.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, investing activities used net cash flows of $4.9 million, which was attributable to purchases of computer software, furniture, fixtures and equipment of $6.2 million partially offset by a distribution from an investment in an unconsolidated investment entity of $1.4 million.\nNet Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash flows provided by financing activities were $20.5 million due to $18.9 million of net cash proceeds from the issuance of our common stock, $2.7 million of contributions from noncontrolling interests in a consolidated entity, $6.6 million of proceeds from borrowings on notes payable and $1.0 million of net borrowings on our revolving credit facilities. These were offset by $4.5 million of dividends paid on our preferred stock, $2.0 million of payments on notes payable and capital leases, $1.2 million of contingent consideration related to the November 2017 acquisition of J&S, $638,000 of loan cost payments, $314,000 in distributions to non-controlling interests and net repayments in advances to employees of $82,000 associated with tax withholdings for restricted stock vesting.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash flows used in financing activities were $44.5 million. These cash outflows consisted of $55.3 million of distributions to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities primarily related to the AQUA Fund that is now dissolved, net advances to employees of $433,000 associated with tax withholdings for restricted stock vestings, $305,000 of payments on notes payable, $28,000 of loan cost payments, and $24,000 for the repurchase of common stock, partially offset by $10.0 million of proceeds from the term loan to finance the acquisition of J&S, $983,000 of contributions from noncontrolling interests in a consolidated entity and net borrowings on the J&S revolving credit facility of $583,000.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash flows used in financing activities was $42.1 million, which consisted of $44.1 million of distributions to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities, utilization of excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation of $284,000, net repayments in advances to employees of $41,000 associated with tax withholdings for restricted stock vestings, $20,000 for the purchase of treasury shares associated with tax withholdings for restricted stock vestings, and $18,000 for cash redemptions of units, partially offset by $2.4 million of contributions from noncontrolling interests in a consolidated entity.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business, we may form or invest in partnerships or joint ventures. We evaluate each partnership and joint venture to determine whether the entity is a VIE. If the entity is determined to be a VIE, we assess whether we are the primary beneficiary and need to consolidate the entity. For further discussion see notes 1 and 2 to our consolidated financial statements.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe table below summarizes future obligations as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>< 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>>5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated interest obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>686\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred compensation plan (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AIM Incentive Plan (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>For variable-rate indebtedness, interest obligations are estimated based on the LIBOR and Prime interest rates as of December 31, 2018.

If we violate these covenants, we could be required to repay a portion of our indebtedness before maturity at a time when we might be unable to arrange financing for such repayment on attractive terms, if at all. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2018.\nIn addition to the amounts discussed above, as of December 31, 2018, we also have approximately $33.9 million of purchase commitments related to our Enhanced Return Funding Program with Ashford Trust which are contingent upon Ashford Trust acquiring additional hotels. See notes 11 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur accounting policies are fully described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d We believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, representing those policies considered most vital to the portrayal of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations and requiring management's most difficult, subjective, and complex judgments.\nRevenue Recognition. Advisory services revenue is reported within our REIT Advisory segment and primarily consists of advisory fees and expense reimbursements that are recognized when services have been rendered. Advisory fees consist of base fees and incentive fees. For Ashford Trust, the base fee was paid quarterly and ranges from 0.50% to 0.70% per annum of the total market capitalization ranging from less than $6.0 billion to greater than $10.0 billion plus, prior to June 26, 2018, the Key Money Asset Management Fee, as defined in the amended and restated advisory agreement, subject to certain minimums. Upon effectiveness of the Enhanced Return Funding Program Agreement and Amendment No. 1 to the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement on June 29, 2018, the base fee is paid monthly and ranges from 0.50% to 0.70% per annum of the total market capitalization ranging from less than $6.0 billion to greater than $10.0 billion plus the Net Asset Fee Adjustment, as defined in the amended and restated advisory agreement, as amended, subject to certain minimums. The Braemar base fee is paid monthly and is fixed at 0.70% of Braemar's total market capitalization plus the Key Money Asset Management Fee, as defined in the advisory agreement, subject to certain minimums. Reimbursements for overhead, internal audit, risk management advisory services and asset management services, including compensation, benefits and travel expense reimbursements, are recognized when services\nhave been rendered. We record advisory revenue for equity grants of Ashford Trust and Braemar common stock and LTIP units awarded to our officers and employees in connection with providing advisory services equal to the fair value of the award in proportion to the requisite service period satisfied during the period, as well an offsetting expense in an equal amount included in salaries and benefits.\u201d\nIncentive advisory fees are measured annually in each year that Ashford Trust's and/or Braemar's annual total stockholder return exceeds the average annual total stockholder return for each company's respective peer group, subject to the FCCR Condition, as defined in the respective advisory agreements. Incentive advisory fees are paid over a three-year period and each payment is subject to the FCCR Condition, which relates to the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges for Ashford Trust or Braemar, as applicable. Historically, during the incentive advisory fee measurement period (i.e. the first year of each three year period), incentive advisory fees have been accrued (or reversed) quarterly based on the amount that would be due pursuant to the applicable advisory agreements as of the interim balance sheet date. The second and third year installments of incentive advisory fees have been recognized as revenue on a pro-rata basis each quarter for the amounts determined in the first year measurement period, subject to the December 31 FCCR Condition each year. Effective with our January 1, 2018 adoption of ASC 606, we no longer record the first year's installment of incentive advisory fee revenue in interim periods prior to the fourth quarter. Prior to measurement in the fourth quarter of each year, our first year installment of incentive advisory fees are subject to significant fluctuation (i.e. based on annual total stockholder returns) and are contingent on a future event during the measurement period (e.g. meeting the FCCR Condition). Accordingly, incentive advisory fees will generally be recognized only upon measurement in the fourth quarter of the first year of the three year period. The second and third year installments of incentive advisory fees are recognized as revenue on a pro-rata basis each quarter as such amounts are not subject to significant reversal.\nAudio visual revenue primarily consists of revenue generated within our J&S segment by providing event technology services such as audio visual services, audio visual equipment rental, staging and meeting services and event-related communication systems as well as related technical support, to our customers in various venues including hotels and convention centers. Revenue is recognized in the period in which services are provided pursuant to the terms of the contractual arrangements with our customers. We also evaluate whether it is appropriate to present (i) the gross amount that our customers pay for our services as revenue, and the related commissions paid to the venue as cost of revenue, or (ii) the net amount (gross revenue less the related commissions paid to the venue) as revenue. We are responsible for the delivery of the services, including providing the necessary labor and equipment to perform the services. We are generally subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers and, while in many cases the venue bills the end customer on our behalf, we bear the risk of collection from the customer. The venues' commissions are not dependent on collections. As a result, our revenue is primarily reported on a gross basis. Cost of revenues for audio visual principally includes commissions paid to venues, direct labor costs, the cost of equipment sub-rentals, depreciation of equipment, amortization of signing bonuses, as well as other costs such as supplies, freight, travel and other overhead from our venue and customer facing operations and any losses on equipment disposal.\nProject management revenue primarily consists of revenue generated within our Premier segment by providing development and construction, capital improvements, refurbishment, project management, and other services such as purchasing, interior design, freight management, and construction management services at properties. Premier receives fees for these services and recognizes revenue over time as services are provided to the customer. Project management revenue also includes revenue from reimbursable costs for accounting, overhead and project manager services provided to projects owned by affiliates of Ashford Trust, Braemar and other owners.\nDebt placement fees include revenues earned from providing debt placement services by Lismore Capital, our wholly-owned subsidiary. These fees are recognized based on a stated percentage of the loan amount when services have been rendered and the subject loan has closed.\nCertain of our consolidated entities enter into contracts with customers that contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. We determine the standalone selling prices based on our consolidated entities' overall pricing objectives taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the customer and the nature and value of the performance obligations within the applicable contracts.\nIncome Taxes-We are a taxable corporation for federal and state income tax purposes. Income tax expense includes U.S. federal and state income taxes and, beginning November 1, 2017, Mexico and Dominican Republic income taxes. In accordance with authoritative accounting guidance, we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.\nDuring the third quarter of 2018, we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize a significant portion of our deferred tax assets because we recorded a $43.7 million deferred tax liability in the third quarter of 2018, and the future reversal of deferred tax liabilities is a source of future taxable income that allows us to utilize our deferred tax assets. Accordingly, in the third quarter of 2018, we reversed the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets by recording a $15.1 million deferred income tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations. The deferred tax liability related to our Premier acquisition, and it is the result of recording our book basis in Premier's acquired intangible assets at fair value while the tax basis of these assets was recorded using the seller's carryover basis, which is lower than fair value.\nThe Income Taxes\u201d topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification addresses the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements. The guidance requires us to determine whether tax positions we have taken or expect to take in a tax return are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority based on the technical merits of the positions. Tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not threshold would be recorded as additional tax expense in the current period. We analyze all open tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations for each jurisdiction, which includes the federal jurisdiction and various states. We classify interest and penalties related to underpayment of income taxes as income tax expense. We and our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states and cities, and, beginning November 1, 2017, in Mexico and the Dominican Republic. Tax years 2013 through 2017 remain subject to potential examination by certain federal and state taxing authorities.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the TCJA into legislation. Under ASC 740, the effects of changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which the new legislation is enacted. In the case of U.S. federal income taxes, the enactment date is the date the bill becomes law (i.e., upon presidential signature). With respect to this legislation, we recorded a one-time income tax expense of approximately $303,000 due to a revaluation of our net deferred tax assets resulting from the decrease in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% and elimination of the ability to carryback net operating losses generated after December 31, 2017. Additionally on December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the TCJA. The Company recognized the provisional tax impacts related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, we have finalized our accounting for the impacts of the TCJA. There were no changes to the provision amounts previously recorded.\nEquity-Based Compensation-Our equity incentive plan provides for the grant of restricted or unrestricted shares of our common stock, equity-based awards and other share awards, share appreciation rights, performance shares, performance units and other equity-based awards or any combination of the foregoing. Equity-based compensation included in salaries and benefits\u201d is accounted for at fair value based on the market price of the shares/options on the date of grant in accordance with applicable authoritative accounting guidance. The fair value is charged to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the shares/options. Grants of restricted stock to independent directors are recorded at fair value based on the market price of our shares at grant date, and this amount is fully expensed in general and administrative\u201d expense as the grants of stock are fully vested on the date of grant. Our officers and employees can be granted common stock and LTIP units from Ashford Trust and Braemar in connection with providing advisory services that result in expense, included in salaries and benefits,\u201d equal to the fair value of the award in proportion to the requisite service period satisfied during the period, as well as offsetting revenue in an equal amount included in advisory services\u201d revenue.\nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2018-07\u201d) in the third quarter of 2018, equity-based awards granted to non-employees were accounted for at fair value based on the market price of the awards at period end, which resulted in recording expense equal to the fair value of the award in proportion to the requisite service period satisfied during the period. After the adoption of ASU 2018-07 in the third quarter of 2018, equity-based awards granted to non-employees are measured at the grant date and expensed ratably over the vesting period based on the original measurement date as the grant date. This results in the recording of expense equal to the ratable amount of the grant date fair value based on the requisite service period satisfied during the period.\nAcquisitions-We account for acquisitions and investments in businesses as business combinations if the target meets the definition of a business and (a) the target is a VIE and we are the target's primary beneficiary, and therefore we must consolidate its financial statements, or (b) we acquire more than 50% of the voting interest of the target and it was not previously consolidated. We record business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The application of the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. The fair value assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nare based on management's estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. Significant assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset, if applicable. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be exposed to potential impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill.\nIf our investment involves the acquisition of an asset or group of assets that does not meet the definition of a business, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. An asset acquisition is recorded at cost, which includes capitalizing transaction costs, and does not result in the recognition of goodwill.\nImpairment of Goodwill-Goodwill is assigned to reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination as of the acquisition date. We assess goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1, or more frequently, if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. In the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, we typically perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the fair value of the goodwill is more likely than not impaired. In considering the qualitative approach, we evaluated factors including, but not limited to, the operational stability and the overall financial performance of the reporting units. We may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value and, if applicable, record an impairment charge based on the excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit based on either a market valuation approach or an analysis of discounted projected future operating cash flows using a discount rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model. Based on the results of our annual impairment assessment, no impairment of goodwill was indicated. No indicators of impairment were identified from the date of our impairment assessment through December 31, 2018.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards-In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, also referred to as ASC 606\u201d Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity shall recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. An entity is required to (a) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (b) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (c) determine the transaction price, (d) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (e) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. In determining the transaction price, an entity may include variable consideration only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized would not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. ASC 606 also specifies the accounting for certain costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer. In addition, the new guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized.\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted the new standard using the modified retrospective approach. Based on our assessment, adoption of the new guidance did not require a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening retained earnings on January 1, 2018. We expect the new standard's impact on net income will be immaterial on an ongoing annual basis; however, the Company does anticipate that the new standard will have an impact on its revenues in interim periods due to timing. The primary impact of adopting the new standard relates to the timing of recognition of incentive advisory fees, which are a form of variable consideration and therefore must be (i) deferred until such fees are probable of not being subject to significant reversal, and (ii) tied to a performance obligation in the contract with the customer so that revenue recognition depicts the transfer of the related advisory services to the customer. Accordingly, the Company no longer records incentive advisory fee revenue in interim periods prior to the fourth quarter of the year in which the incentive fee is measured. The Company expects that this could impact its revenues in future interim periods, but we are unable to estimate the impact because future incentive advisory fees are calculated based on future changes in total stockholder return of our REIT clients compared to the total stockholder return of their respective peer group. There are no material changes in revenue recognition for audio visual, investment management reimbursements, debt placement fees, claims management services revenue, lease revenue or other services revenue. See note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our adoption of ASC 606.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASU 2016-01\u201d), which requires an entity to: (i) measure equity investments at fair value through net income, with certain exceptions; (ii) present in OCI the changes in instrument-specific credit risk for financial liabilities measured using the fair value option; (iii) present financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset; (iv) calculate the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes based on an exit price; and (v) assess a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to unrealized losses of AFS debt securities in combination with other deferred tax assets. ASU 2016-01 provides an election to subsequently measure certain nonmarketable equity investments at cost less any impairment and adjusted for certain observable price changes. It also requires a qualitative impairment assessment of such equity investments and amends certain fair value disclosure requirements. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017,\nincluding interim periods within those fiscal years. Certain provisions of ASU 2016-01 are eligible for early adoption. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-03, as technical corrections and improvements to amend and clarify certain aspects of the guidance issued in ASU 2016-01. We have adopted this standard effective January 1, 2018, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments - a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force ( ASU 2016-15\u201d). The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. Certain issues addressed in this guidance include debt payments or debt extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, distributions received from equity method investments and beneficial interests in securitization transactions. We adopted this standard retrospectively effective January 1, 2018, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of cash flows and related disclosures for the year ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the adoption of ASU 2016-15 resulted in the bifurcation of the $2.6 million contingent consideration payment associated with the acquisition of J&S between financing and operating cash flows (included in payments due to affiliates\u201d) in the amounts of $1.2 million and $1.4 million, respectively, within our consolidated statements of cash flows. See notes 5 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805) - Clarifying the Definition of a Business ( ASU 2017-01\u201d), which clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether a transaction should be accounted for as an acquisition (or disposal) of an asset or a business. We have adopted this standard effective January 1, 2018.\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2018-07 expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from non-employees and aligns the guidance for share-based payments to non-employees with the requirements for share-based payments granted to employees. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We elected to early adopt the standard effective July 1, 2018, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards-In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases ( ASU 2016-02\u201d). The new standard establishes a right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) model that requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases ( ASU 2018-10\u201d) and ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842), Targeted Improvements ( ASU 2018-11\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2018-10 affect only narrow aspects of the guidance issued in the amendments in ASU 2016-02, including but not limited to lease residual value guarantee, rate implicit in the lease, lease term and purchase option. The amendments in ASU 2018-11 provide an optional transition method for adoption of the new standard, which will allow entities to continue to apply the legacy guidance in ASC 840, including its disclosure requirements, in the comparative periods presented in the year of adoption. In December 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-20, Leases (Topic 842), Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors ( ASU 2018-20\u201d). The amendments create a lessor practical expedient applicable to sales and other similar taxes incurred in connection with a lease, and simplify lessor accounting for lessor costs paid by the lessee. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, which will require us to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of 2019 on a modified retrospective basis with an option to use the transition relief provided in ASU 2018-11. The accounting for leases under which we are the lessor remains largely unchanged. While we continue evaluating our lease portfolio to assess the impact that ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements, we expect the primary impact to our consolidated financial statements upon adoption will be the recognition, on a discounted basis, of our future minimum rentals due under noncancellable leases on our consolidated balance sheet resulting in the recording of ROU assets and lease obligations estimated to be between $23.6 million and $28.8 million. Upon adoption, we will not recognize lease revenue for our rent-free leases of FF&E commencing on or after the adoption date under our ERFP agreements with our related parties Ashford Trust and Braemar. We expect to elect the package of practical expedients in transition that permits entities not to reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, to retain the lease classification and to continue to capitalize initial direct costs for any leases that exist prior to adoption of the standard. We expect to use the transition method in ASU 2018-11 that allows us to adopt the new lease standard effective January 1, 2019, and not reevaluate or recast prior periods. However, we are still evaluating the available transition methods. We are implementing repeatable processes to manage ongoing lease data collection and analysis, and evaluating accounting policies and internal controls that will be impacted by the new standards.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ( ASU 2016-13\u201d). ASU 2016-13 sets forth an expected credit loss\u201d impairment model to replace the current incurred loss\u201d method of recognizing credit losses. The standard requires measurement and recognition of expected\ncredit losses for most financial assets held. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for periods beginning after December 15, 2018. In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. ASU 2016-13 introduced an expected credit loss methodology for the impairment of financial assets measured at amortized cost basis. That methodology replaces the probable, incurred loss model for those assets. ASU 2018-19 is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update 2018-270, which has been deleted. Additionally, the amendments clarify that receivables arising from operating leases are not within the scope of Subtopic 326-20. Instead, impairment of receivables arising from operating leases should be accounted for in accordance with Topic 842, Leases. We are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-13 will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment ( ASU 2017-04\u201d), which removes the requirement to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount as part of step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. As a result, under ASU 2017-04, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. However, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. In addition, ASU 2017-04 clarifies that an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We are evaluating the impact that ASU 2017-04 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement ( ASU 2018-13\u201d). ASU 2018-13 modifies certain disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements including requiring disclosures on changes in unrealized gains and losses in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements and a requirement to disclose the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2018-13 will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract ( ASU 2018-15\u201d). ASU 2018-15 aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software as well as hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2018-15 will have on our consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_truncated": "The table below summarizes future obligations as of December 31, 2018

revenue of $8.2 million from Braemar.

Agreement (the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement\u201d) with Ashford Trust. The independent members of the board of directors of each of the Company and Ashford Trust, with the assistance of separate and independent legal counsel, engaged to negotiate the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement on behalf of the Company and Ashford Trust, respectively. Under the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement, the Company agreed to provide $50 million to Ashford Trust in connection with Ashford Trust's acquisition of hotels recommended by us, with the option to increase the funding commitment to up to $100 million upon mutual agreement by the parties. The Company is obligated to provide Ashford Trust 10% of the acquired hotel's purchase price in exchange for FF&E, which is subsequently leased to Ashford Trust rent-free. The Company records ERFP obligations in our consolidated balance sheet as other assets\u201d and other liabilities.\u201d Ashford Trust must provide reasonable advance notice to the Company to request ERFP funds in accordance with the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement. The Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement requires that the Company acquire the related FF&E either at the time of the property acquisition or at any time generally within two years of Ashford Trust acquiring the hotel property. The Company recognizes the related depreciation tax deduction at the time such FF&E is purchased by the Company and placed into service at Ashford Trust properties. However, the timing of the FF&E being purchased and placed into service is subject to uncertainties outside of the Company's control that could delay the realization of any tax benefit associated with the purchase of FF&E. See notes 11 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\n (3) As a result of our spin-off, we assumed all of the unrecognized equity-based compensation associated with prior Ashford Trust equity grants. As a result, we continued to recognize equity-based compensation expense related to these grants through the final vesting date in April 2017. The expense decreased each year as the Ashford Trust equity grants became fully vested. See notes 2 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements. \nOn April 2, 2018, Ashford Inc. announced the death of long-time executive David A. Brooks, who served in multiple leadership roles with the Company since 2003.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in key line items from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\nOn November 8, 2018, OpenKey renewed the Loan and Security Agreement that expired in October 2018 for a revolving credit facility in the amount of $1.5 million. The credit facility is secured by all of OpenKey's assets and matures on April 30, 2020, with an interest rate of Prime Rate plus 2.75%. Creditors do not have recourse to Ashford Inc. At December 31, 2018 and\n__________\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $1.4 million, or 115.2%, to $2.5 million for 2017 compared to 2016, primarily as a result of furniture, fixtures and equipment additions related to software implementation, key money assets and the 2017 J&S acquisition. The increase was also due to the amortization of intangible assets related to the 2017 acquisitions of J&S and Pure Wellness. See note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, excludes depreciation expense related to audio visual rental pool equipment of $411,000, which is included in cost of revenues for audio visual.\nOn March 21, 2018, Ashford Inc. entered into the First Amendment (the Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement dated March 1, 2018 (the Credit Facility\u201d), with Ashford Hospitality Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of Ashford Inc., Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and letters of credit issuer, and the lenders from time to time party thereto. The Amendment is effective as of March 1, 2018, which is the date the Credit Facility became effective. Pursuant to the Amendment, the financial covenant of consolidated tangible net worth was replaced with consolidated net worth, and Ashford Inc. is required to maintain consolidated net worth not less than 75% of the consolidated net worth as of December 31, 2017, plus 75% of the net equity proceeds of any future equity issuances by Ashford Inc.\nIf our investment involves the acquisition of an asset or group of assets that does not meet the definition of a business, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. An asset acquisition is recorded at cost, which includes capitalizing transaction costs, and does not result in the recognition of goodwill.\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary for operating expenses primarily attributable to paying our employees. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations, existing cash balances and, if necessary, short-term borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which we believe will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our existing non-discretionary obligations and anticipated ordinary course operating expenses for at least the next twelve months.\n\n (2) Incentive advisory fee includes the second year installment of the 2016 incentive fee in the amount of $1.8 million for 2017, earned in connection with our advisory agreement with Ashford Trust and the third year installment of the 2015 incentive fee in the amount of $1.3 million for 2017, earned in connection with our advisory agreement with Braemar. No incentive fee was earned from Ashford Trust or Braemar for the 2017 measurement period. \nIn the normal course of business, we may form or invest in partnerships or joint ventures. We evaluate each partnership and joint venture to determine whether the entity is a VIE. If the entity is determined to be a VIE, we assess whether we are the primary beneficiary and need to consolidate the entity. For further discussion see notes 1 and 2 to our consolidated financial statements.\n2017, there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility. In connection with the 2018 renewal, OpenKey granted the creditors a 10-year warrant to purchase approximately 23,000 shares of OpenKey's preferred stock at $1.61 per share with an estimated fair value of $26,000. The fair value of the warrants was recorded in noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities and debt issuance costs, which is amortized over the term of the line of credit.\n________\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, investing activities used net cash flows of $4.9 million, which was attributable to purchases of computer software, furniture, fixtures and equipment of $6.2 million partially offset by a distribution from an investment in an unconsolidated investment entity of $1.4 million.\ncredit losses for most financial assets held. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for periods beginning after December 15, 2018. In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. ASU 2016-13 introduced an expected credit loss methodology for the impairment of financial assets measured at amortized cost basis. That methodology replaces the probable, incurred loss model for those assets. ASU 2018-19 is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update 2018-270, which has been deleted. Additionally, the amendments clarify that receivables arising from operating leases are not within the scope of Subtopic 326-20. Instead, impairment of receivables arising from operating leases should be accounted for in accordance with Topic 842, Leases. We are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-13 will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n (6) The $72.0 million increase in audio visual revenue is due to our acquisition of J&S in November 2017. \nOn April 6, 2018, Ashford Inc. signed a definitive agreement to acquire the project management business of Remington Holdings, L.P. ( Remington\u201d).\nIncentive advisory fees are measured annually in each year that Ashford Trust's and/or Braemar's annual total stockholder return exceeds the average annual total stockholder return for each company's respective peer group, subject to the FCCR Condition, as defined in the respective advisory agreements. Incentive advisory fees are paid over a three-year period and each payment is subject to the FCCR Condition, which relates to the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges for Ashford Trust or Braemar, as applicable. Historically, during the incentive advisory fee measurement period (i.e. the first year of each three year period), incentive advisory fees have been accrued (or reversed) quarterly based on the amount that would be due pursuant to the applicable advisory agreements as of the interim balance sheet date. The second and third year installments of incentive advisory fees have been recognized as revenue on a pro-rata basis each quarter for the amounts determined in the first year measurement period, subject to the December 31 FCCR Condition each year. Effective with our January 1, 2018 adoption of ASC 606, we no longer record the first year's installment of incentive advisory fee revenue in interim periods prior to the fourth quarter. Prior to measurement in the fourth quarter of each year, our first year installment of incentive advisory fees are subject to significant fluctuation (i.e. based on annual total stockholder returns) and are contingent on a future event during the measurement period (e.g. meeting the FCCR Condition). Accordingly, incentive advisory fees will generally be recognized only upon measurement in the fourth quarter of the first year of the three year period. The second and third year installments of incentive advisory fees are recognized as revenue on a pro-rata basis each quarter as such amounts are not subject to significant reversal.\nIn connection with Ashford Trust's acquisitions of The Embassy Suites New York Midtown Manhattan on January 22, 2019 and the Hilton Santa Cruz/Scotts Valley on February 26, 2019, the Company is obligated to provide Ashford Trust with approximately $19.5 million and $5.0 million, respectively, for a total obligation of $24.5 million in exchange for FF&E at Ashford Trust properties, subject to the terms of the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement. After consideration of the $16.1 million ERFP obligations funded in 2018 and the $24.5 million ERFP obligations incurred in connection with Ashford Trust's acquisitions in 2019, the Company has $9.4 million remaining of its initial $50 million ERFP funding commitment to Ashford Trust.\n (2) Distributions under the deferred compensation plan are made in cash, unless the participant has elected Ashford Inc. common stock as the investment option, in which any such distributions would be made in Ashford Inc. common stock. The deferred compensation plan obligation is carried at fair value based on the underlying investment(s). See note 16 to our consolidated financial statements. \nProject management revenue primarily consists of revenue generated within our Premier segment by providing development and construction, capital improvements, refurbishment, project management, and other services such as purchasing, interior design, freight management, and construction management services at properties. Premier receives fees for these services and recognizes revenue over time as services are provided to the customer. Project management revenue also includes revenue from reimbursable costs for accounting, overhead and project manager services provided to projects owned by affiliates of Ashford Trust, Braemar and other owners.\nNet Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $28.1 million primarily due to $16.1 million of capital expenditures related to our ERFP agreement with Ashford Trust, $8.9 million of capital expenditures for audio visual equipment and computer software, and $5.5 million of capital expenditures for RED marine vessels, partially offset by $2.3 million of cash acquired in the acquisition of Premier and net proceeds from the disposal of FF&E of $140,000.\n (1) The change in cash salaries and benefits expense is primarily due to fluctuations in the number of employees, salary and bonus awards, group insurance costs, payroll taxes and employee participation in the benefits offered. The acquisitions of J&S and Pure Wellness in 2017 contributed $868,000 and $667,000, respectively, to the $2.2 million increase over 2016. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash flows used in financing activities were $44.5 million. These cash outflows consisted of $55.3 million of distributions to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities primarily related to the AQUA Fund that is now dissolved, net advances to employees of $433,000 associated with tax withholdings for restricted stock vestings, $305,000 of payments on notes payable, $28,000 of loan cost payments, and $24,000 for the repurchase of common stock, partially offset by $10.0 million of proceeds from the term loan to finance the acquisition of J&S, $983,000 of contributions from noncontrolling interests in a consolidated entity and net borrowings on the J&S revolving credit facility of $583,000.\nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2018-07\u201d) in the third quarter of 2018, equity-based awards granted to non-employees were accounted for at fair value based on the market price of the awards at period end, which resulted in recording expense equal to the fair value of the award in proportion to the requisite service period satisfied during the period. After the adoption of ASU 2018-07 in the third quarter of 2018, equity-based awards granted to non-employees are measured at the grant date and expensed ratably over the vesting period based on the original measurement date as the grant date. This results in the recording of expense equal to the ratable amount of the grant date fair value based on the requisite service period satisfied during the period.\nOur accounting policies are fully described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d We believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, representing those policies considered most vital to the portrayal of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations and requiring management's most difficult, subjective, and complex judgments.\nOverview\nIn connection with the acquisition of Premier, we effected a holding company reorganization. The change in holding company organizational structure was effected by a merger, pursuant to which each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of our predecessor publicly-traded parent Ashford OAINC Inc. (formerly named Ashford Inc.) ( Old Ashford\u201d) was converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company having the same rights, powers and preferences and the same qualifications, limitations and restrictions as a share of common stock of Old Ashford. As a result of the foregoing, we became the successor issuer of Old Ashford under Rule 12g-3 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act\u201d). Our common stock continues to be listed on the NYSE American under the symbol AINC.\u201d\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments. Unrealized gain on investments was $203,000 for 2017 and $2.3 million for 2016, primarily related to investments held by the AQUA U.S. Fund. The unrealized gain (loss) on investments is based on changes in closing market prices during the period.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $83,000 and $0 for 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to the notes payable, lines of credit and capital leases held by our consolidated subsidiaries. See notes 2 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements.\n (3) The increase in reimbursable expenses revenue is due to higher revenue of $1.5 million from Ashford Trust and lower revenue of $700,000 from Braemar. Reimbursable expenses include overhead, internal audit, insurance claims advisory and asset management services. \nDebt placement fees include revenues earned from providing debt placement services by Lismore Capital, our wholly-owned subsidiary. These fees are recognized based on a stated percentage of the loan amount when services have been rendered and the subject loan has closed.\n (4) Equity grants of Ashford Trust's and Braemar's common stock and LTIP units are awarded to our officers and employees as part of our advisory agreements with each company, for which we record offsetting revenue in an equal amount. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in the fair value of equity grants. See notes 2 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements. \n (9) The increase in debt placement fee revenue is due to an unusually high volume of debt financings during the second quarter of 2018, primarily from Ashford Trust. We recorded higher revenue of $4.2 million from Ashford Trust and higher revenue of $775,000 from Braemar. Debt placement fees include revenues earned from providing debt placement services by Lismore Capital, our wholly-owned subsidiary. \n (6) The increase in audio visual revenue is due to higher revenue of $9.2 million from third parties, as a result of our acquisition of J&S. \n\nAmortization of Loan Costs. Amortization of loan costs was $39,000 and $0 for 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to the notes payable and lines of credit held by our consolidated subsidiaries. See notes 2 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements.\nare based on management's estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. Significant assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset, if applicable. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be exposed to potential impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill.\nRealized Gain (Loss) on Investment in Unconsolidated Entity. We had no realized gain or loss on an investment in an unconsolidated entity in 2017. We recorded a realized loss in an unconsolidated investment fund of $3.6 million in 2016 for which AIM was the investment advisor.\nAs required for disclosure under the Fifth Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement (the Fifth Amended and Restated Braemar Advisory Agreement\u201d), for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2018, the total incremental expenses incurred (including all reimbursable expenses), as reasonably determined, in connection with providing services to Braemar under the Fifth Amended and Restated Braemar Advisory Agreement was $10.2 million.\n (12) Indicates REIT advisory revenue. \n (3) As a result of our spin-off, we assumed all of the unrecognized equity-based compensation associated with prior Ashford Trust equity grants. As a result, we continued to recognize equity-based compensation expense related to these grants through the final vesting date in April 2017. The expense decreased each year as the Ashford Trust equity grants became fully vested. See notes 2 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements. \nOn June 26, 2018, the Company entered into the Enhanced Return Funding Program Agreement and Amendment No. 1 to the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement (the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement\u201d) with Ashford Trust. The independent members of the board of directors of each of the Company and Ashford Trust, with the assistance of separate and independent legal counsel, engaged to negotiate the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement on behalf of the Company and Ashford Trust, respectively. Under the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement, the Company agreed to provide $50 million to Ashford Trust in connection with Ashford Trust's acquisition of hotels recommended by us, with the option to increase the funding commitment to up to $100 million upon mutual agreement by the parties. The Company is obligated to provide Ashford Trust 10% of the acquired hotel's purchase price in exchange for FF&E, which is subsequently leased to Ashford Trust rent-free. The Company records ERFP obligations in our consolidated balance sheet as other assets\u201d and other liabilities.\u201d Ashford Trust must provide reasonable advance notice to the Company to request ERFP funds in accordance with the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement. The Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement requires that the Company acquire the related FF&E either at the time of the property acquisition or at any time generally within two years of Ashford Trust acquiring the hotel property. The Company recognizes the related depreciation tax deduction at the time such FF&E is purchased by the Company and placed into service at Ashford Trust properties. However, the timing of the FF&E being purchased and placed into service is subject to uncertainties outside of the Company's control that could delay the realization of any tax benefit associated with the purchase of FF&E. In connection with Ashford Trust's acquisition of the Hilton Old Town Alexandria and La Posada de Santa Fe in 2018, and subject to the terms of the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement, the Company was obligated to provide Ashford Trust with approximately $16.1 million of FF&E at Ashford Trust properties. The $16.1 million of FF&E was purchased and leased to Ashford Trust with an effective date of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had no remaining balance in our ERFP obligation to Ashford Trust in respect of hotels already acquired by Ashford Trust.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the TCJA into legislation. Under ASC 740, the effects of changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which the new legislation is enacted. In the case of U.S. federal income taxes, the enactment date is the date the bill becomes law (i.e., upon presidential signature). With respect to this legislation, we recorded a one-time income tax expense of approximately $303,000 due to a revaluation of our net deferred tax assets resulting from the decrease in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% and elimination of the ability to carryback net operating losses generated after December 31, 2017. Additionally on December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the TCJA. The Company recognized the provisional tax impacts related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, we have finalized our accounting for the impacts of the TCJA. There were no changes to the provision amounts previously recorded.\n (4) The decrease in non-cash stock/unit-based compensation revenue is due to higher revenue of $2.6 million from Ashford Trust and lower revenue of $5.5 million from Braemar. Non-cash stock/unit-based compensation revenue is associated with equity grants of Ashford Trust's and Braemar's common stock and LTIP units awarded to officers and employees of Ashford Inc. for which we recorded an offsetting expense in an equal amount included in salaries and benefits.\u201d \nincluding interim periods within those fiscal years. Certain provisions of ASU 2016-01 are eligible for early adoption. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-03, as technical corrections and improvements to amend and clarify certain aspects of the guidance issued in ASU 2016-01. We have adopted this standard effective January 1, 2018, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nTotal Revenue. Total revenue increased $113.9 million, or 139.7%, to $195.5 million for 2018 compared to 2017 due to the following (in thousands):\nOn March 12, 2018, the Board of Directors of Ashford Inc. appointed Mr. J. Robison Hays, III, as Co-President and Chief\n (2) The increase in expense is due to additional stock options granted in 2017 with a three year vesting period for which there was no related expense in 2016. See notes 2, 15 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements. \nincluded in cost of revenues for audio visual, and also excludes depreciation expense related to marine vessels of $172,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018, which is included in other\u201d operating expense.\n (3) Distributions under the AIM incentive plan will be made in cash within 45 days of March 31, 2019. The AIM incentive plan obligation is carried at amortized fair value. See note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.  Some of our loan agreements contain financial and other covenants. If we violate these covenants, we could be required to repay a portion of our indebtedness before maturity at a time when we might be unable to arrange financing for such repayment on attractive terms, if at all. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2018.\nOn November 1, 2017, our J&S operating subsidiary entered into a series of financing transactions for which the creditors do not have recourse to Ashford Inc., including a $10.0 million term loan to finance the acquisition of J&S. The term loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.25% and matures on November 1, 2022. Net deferred loan costs associated with this financing of $183,000 and $226,000, respectively, are included as a reduction to notes payable on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. In connection with the term loan, the subsidiary entered into an interest rate cap with an initial notional amount totaling $5.0 million and a strike rate of 4.0%. The fair value of the interest rate cap at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was not material. The subsidiary also entered into a $3.0 million revolving credit facility which bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.25% and matures on November 1, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2018, $21.8 million was drawn and approximately $20.8 million of payments were made on the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2018, approximately $1.3 million of credit was available under the revolving credit facility and approximately $1.7 million was outstanding. These debt agreements contain various financial covenants that, among other things, require the maintenance of certain fixed charge coverage ratios. As of December 31, 2018, our J&S operating subsidiary was in compliance with all financial covenants.\nRecent Developments\n (2) The decrease in these costs is primarily due to software project timing.  Impairment. Impairment of capitalized software implementation costs was $1.1 million during 2017 compared to $0 for 2016. See notes 2 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements.\n (5) The increase in other advisory revenue is due to higher revenue of $244,000 from Braemar as a result of the $5.0 million cash payment received upon stockholder approval of the Fourth Amended and Restated Braemar Advisory Agreement in June 2017. The payment is included in deferred income\u201d on our consolidated balance sheet and is being recognized over the initial ten-year term of the agreement. \n(Income) Loss from Consolidated Entities Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests. The noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities were allocated losses of $358,000 in 2017 and $8.9 million in 2016. See notes 2, 13, and 17 to our consolidated financial statements for more details regarding ownership interests, carrying values and allocations.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ( ASU 2016-13\u201d). ASU 2016-13 sets forth an expected credit loss\u201d impairment model to replace the current incurred loss\u201d method of recognizing credit losses. The standard requires measurement and recognition of expected\n (10) In connection with our legacy key money transactions with our managed REITs, we lease FF&E to Ashford Trust and Braemar rent-free. A portion of the base advisory fee is allocated to lease revenue each period equal to the estimated fair value of the lease payments that would have been made. \n (8) The increase in debt placement fee revenue is due to higher revenue of $913,000 from Ashford Trust and $224,000 from Braemar. Debt placement fees include revenues earned through provision of debt placement services by Lismore Capital, our wholly-owned subsidiary. \nOn August 8, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Premier, the project management business formerly conducted by certain affiliates of Remington, for a total transaction value of $203 million. As a result, the project management services that were previously provided by Remington Lodging & Hospitality, LLC, ( Remington Lodging\u201d) are now provided by a subsidiary of Ashford Inc. under the respective project management agreement with each customer, including Ashford Trust and Braemar. The purchase price was paid by issuing 8,120,000 shares of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to the sellers of Premier (the Remington Sellers\u201d), primarily MJB Investments, LP (which is wholly-owned by Monty J. Bennett, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our board of directors), and his father Archie Bennett, Jr., the Chairman Emeritus of Ashford Trust (together, the Bennetts\u201d). The Series B Convertible Preferred Stock has a conversion price of $140 per share and would convert into 1,450,000 shares of our common stock. Dividends on the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock are payable at an annual rate of 5.5% in the first year, 6.0% in the second year, and 6.5% in the third year and each year thereafter. In addition to certain separate class voting rights, the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock vote on an as-converted basis with the holders of the common stock on all matters submitted for approval by the holders of our capital stock possessing general voting rights. However, for five years following the closing of the acquisition of Premier, the Remington Sellers and their transferees are subject to certain voting restrictions with respect to shares in excess of 25% of the combined voting power of the Company's outstanding capital stock. The holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock have certain conversion rights upon certain events constituting a change of control of the Company. See note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.\nrelated to software implementation costs from Ashford Trust and Braemar of $1.7 million and $126,000, respectively, which was partially offset by the impairment of the related capitalized software, as discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, in the amount of $1.1 million. See note 17 to our consolidated financial statements.\n (11) Indicates REIT advisory revenue. \nOn August 31, 2018, our RED operating subsidiary entered into a term loan of $1.8 million for which the creditor has recourse to Ashford Inc. The term loan bears interest at the Prime Rate plus 2.00% and matures on February 1, 2029.\n (3) The increase in reimbursable expenses revenue is due to higher revenue of $305,000 from Ashford Trust offset by lower revenue of $173,000 from Braemar. Reimbursable expenses include overhead, internal audit, risk management advisory and asset management services. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized income from reimbursable expenses \nImpairment of Goodwill-Goodwill is assigned to reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination as of the acquisition date. We assess goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1, or more frequently, if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. In the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, we typically perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the fair value of the goodwill is more likely than not impaired. In considering the qualitative approach, we evaluated factors including, but not limited to, the operational stability and the overall financial performance of the reporting units. We may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value and, if applicable, record an impairment charge based on the excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit based on either a market valuation approach or an analysis of discounted projected future operating cash flows using a discount rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model. Based on the results of our annual impairment assessment, no impairment of goodwill was indicated. No indicators of impairment were identified from the date of our impairment assessment through December 31, 2018.\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments. Unrealized gain on investments was $0 for 2018 and $203,000 for 2017, primarily related to investments held by the AQUA U.S. Fund which was fully dissolved during the year ended December 31, 2017. The unrealized gain (loss) on investments is based on changes in closing market prices during the period.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment ( ASU 2017-04\u201d), which removes the requirement to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount as part of step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. As a result, under ASU 2017-04, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. However, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. In addition, ASU 2017-04 clarifies that an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We are evaluating the impact that ASU 2017-04 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted the new standard using the modified retrospective approach. Based on our assessment, adoption of the new guidance did not require a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening retained earnings on January 1, 2018. We expect the new standard's impact on net income will be immaterial on an ongoing annual basis; however, the Company does anticipate that the new standard will have an impact on its revenues in interim periods due to timing. The primary impact of adopting the new standard relates to the timing of recognition of incentive advisory fees, which are a form of variable consideration and therefore must be (i) deferred until such fees are probable of not being subject to significant reversal, and (ii) tied to a performance obligation in the contract with the customer so that revenue recognition depicts the transfer of the related advisory services to the customer. Accordingly, the Company no longer records incentive advisory fee revenue in interim periods prior to the fourth quarter of the year in which the incentive fee is measured. The Company expects that this could impact its revenues in future interim periods, but we are unable to estimate the impact because future incentive advisory fees are calculated based on future changes in total stockholder return of our REIT clients compared to the total stockholder return of their respective peer group. There are no material changes in revenue recognition for audio visual, investment management reimbursements, debt placement fees, claims management services revenue, lease revenue or other services revenue. See note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our adoption of ASC 606.\nOther. Other operating expense was $2.2 million and $0 for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Other operating expense includes cost of goods sold and royalties associated with Pure Wellness and OpenKey as well as expense from the increase in fair value of contingent consideration related to the J&S acquisition.\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on Investment in Unconsolidated Entity. We recorded no unrealized gain (loss) on investment in unconsolidated entities in 2017. We recorded an unrealized gain in an unconsolidated investment fund of $2.1 million in 2016 for which AIM was the investment advisor.\nNet (Income) Loss Attributable to Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests. The redeemable noncontrolling interests were allocated a loss of $1.4 million in 2018 and a loss of $1.5 million in 2017. Redeemable noncontrolling interests represented ownership interests in Ashford Holdings and certain of our consolidated subsidiaries. Prior to April 6, 2017, the noncontrolling interests represented ownership interests in Ashford LLC. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of ownership interests, carrying values and allocations, see notes 2, 14, and 17 to our consolidated financial statements.\nEffective January 1, 2019, we acquired a 30% noncontrolling ownership interest in Real Estate Advisory Holdings LLC (\"REA Holdings\"), a real estate advisory firm that provides financing, advisory and property sales services primarily to clients in the hospitality and leisure industry, for a purchase price of approximately $3.0 million which was paid in the form of $2.1 million cash and the issuance of 16,529 shares of our common stock (approximately $890,000) to the seller pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements under the Securities Act, provided under Section 4(a)(2) thereunder. We have an option to acquire an additional 50% of the ownership interests in REA Holdings for $12.5 million beginning on January 1, 2022. Our investment in REA Holdings is accounted for under the equity method as we have significant influence over the voting interest entity.\nOn March 1, 2018, the Company and its subsidiary Ashford Hospitality Holdings LLC entered into a $35 million senior revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. The credit facility provides for a three-year revolving line of credit and bears interest at the Base Rate plus 2.00% to 2.50% or LIBOR plus 3.00% to 3.50%, depending on the leverage level of the Company. There is a one-year extension option subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The new credit facility includes the opportunity to expand the borrowing capacity by up to $40 million to an aggregate amount of $75 million, subject to certain conditions. At December 31, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility.\nNet Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities. Operating activities provided net cash flows of $21.5 million and $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to an increase in earnings as well as the timing of settlements with related parties and payments to vendors, partially offset by $10.4 million of transaction costs related to the acquisition of Premier, $1.4 million of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of J&S and the timing of operating subsidiaries' receipt of revenues. In connection with our Fourth Amended and Restated Braemar Advisory Agreement, we received a $5.0 million cash payment in June 2017 from Braemar which positively impacted operating cash flows in the year ended December 31, 2017. The higher cash flows provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily a result of the liquidation of investments in securities held by the AQUA U.S. Fund during the year ended December 31, 2016. Cash flows from operations is impacted by\n________\nRealized Gain (Loss) on Investments. Realized loss on investments was $294,000 for 2017 and $10.1 million in 2016. The realized loss on investments is related to investments held by the AQUA U.S. Fund and options on futures contracts.\nIncome Taxes-We are a taxable corporation for federal and state income tax purposes. Income tax expense includes U.S. federal and state income taxes and, beginning November 1, 2017, Mexico and Dominican Republic income taxes. In accordance with authoritative accounting guidance, we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.\n (7) The increase in investment management reimbursements is due to higher revenue of $2.0 million from Ashford Trust. Investment management reimbursements include AIM's management of Ashford Trust's excess cash under the Investment Management Agreement executed in 2017. AIM is not compensated for its services but is reimbursed for all costs and expenses. \nOn January 15, 2019, the Company entered into the Enhanced Return Funding Program Agreement and Amendment No. 1 to the Fifth Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement (the Braemar ERFP Agreement\u201d) with Braemar. The independent members of the board of directors of each of the Company and Braemar, with the assistance of separate and independent legal counsel, engaged to negotiate the Braemar ERFP Agreement on behalf of the Company and Braemar, respectively. Under the Braemar ERFP Agreement, the Company agreed to provide $50 million to Braemar in connection with Braemar's acquisition of hotels recommended by us, with the option to increase the funding commitment to up to $100 million upon mutual agreement by the parties. Under the Braemar ERFP Agreement, the Company is obligated to provide Braemar 10% of the acquired hotel's purchase price in exchange for FF&E, which is subsequently leased by the Company to Braemar rent-free. In connection with Braemar's acquisition of The Ritz-Carlton Lake Tahoe on January 15, 2019, the Company is obligated to provide Braemar with approximately $10.3 million in exchange for FF&E at Braemar properties, subject to the terms of the Braemar ERFP Agreement.\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2018-07 expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from non-employees and aligns the guidance for share-based payments to non-employees with the requirements for share-based payments granted to employees. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We elected to early adopt the standard effective July 1, 2018, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nAudio visual revenue primarily consists of revenue generated within our J&S segment by providing event technology services such as audio visual services, audio visual equipment rental, staging and meeting services and event-related communication systems as well as related technical support, to our customers in various venues including hotels and convention centers. Revenue is recognized in the period in which services are provided pursuant to the terms of the contractual arrangements with our customers. We also evaluate whether it is appropriate to present (i) the gross amount that our customers pay for our services as revenue, and the related commissions paid to the venue as cost of revenue, or (ii) the net amount (gross revenue less the related commissions paid to the venue) as revenue. We are responsible for the delivery of the services, including providing the necessary labor and equipment to perform the services. We are generally subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers and, while in many cases the venue bills the end customer on our behalf, we bear the risk of collection from the customer. The venues' commissions are not dependent on collections. As a result, our revenue is primarily reported on a gross basis. Cost of revenues for audio visual principally includes commissions paid to venues, direct labor costs, the cost of equipment sub-rentals, depreciation of equipment, amortization of signing bonuses, as well as other costs such as supplies, freight, travel and other overhead from our venue and customer facing operations and any losses on equipment disposal.\nAlso on November 1, 2017, in connection with the acquisition of J&S, our J&S operating subsidiary entered into a $3.0 million equipment note and a $2.0 million draw term loan agreement. These loans each bear interest at LIBOR plus 3.25% and mature on November 1, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2018, $2.3 million was drawn on the equipment note and $2.0 million was outstanding on the draw term loan. All the loans in connection with the acquisition of J&S are partially secured by a security interest on all of the assets and equity interests of our J&S operating subsidiary.\nEquity-Based Compensation-Our equity incentive plan provides for the grant of restricted or unrestricted shares of our common stock, equity-based awards and other share awards, share appreciation rights, performance shares, performance units and other equity-based awards or any combination of the foregoing. Equity-based compensation included in salaries and benefits\u201d is accounted for at fair value based on the market price of the shares/options on the date of grant in accordance with applicable authoritative accounting guidance. The fair value is charged to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the shares/options. Grants of restricted stock to independent directors are recorded at fair value based on the market price of our shares at grant date, and this amount is fully expensed in general and administrative\u201d expense as the grants of stock are fully vested on the date of grant. Our officers and employees can be granted common stock and LTIP units from Ashford Trust and Braemar in connection with providing advisory services that result in expense, included in salaries and benefits,\u201d equal to the fair value of the award in proportion to the requisite service period satisfied during the period, as well as offsetting revenue in an equal amount included in advisory services\u201d revenue.\nDuring the third quarter of 2018, we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize a significant portion of our deferred tax assets because we recorded a $43.7 million deferred tax liability in the third quarter of 2018, and the future reversal of deferred tax liabilities is a source of future taxable income that allows us to utilize our deferred tax assets. Accordingly, in the third quarter of 2018, we reversed the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets by recording a $15.1 million deferred income tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations. The deferred tax liability related to our Premier acquisition, and it is the result of recording our book basis in Premier's acquired intangible assets at fair value while the tax basis of these assets was recorded using the seller's carryover basis, which is lower than fair value.\nOn November 8, 2018, OpenKey renewed the Loan and Security Agreement that expired in October 2018 for a revolving credit facility in the amount of $1.5 million. The credit facility is secured by all of OpenKey's assets and matures on April 30, 2020, with an interest rate of Prime Rate plus 2.75%. Creditors do not have recourse to Ashford Inc. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility. In connection with the 2018 renewal, OpenKey granted the creditors a 10-year warrant to purchase approximately 23,000 shares of OpenKey's preferred stock at $1.61 per share with an estimated fair value of $26,000. The fair value of the warrants was recorded in noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities and debt issuance costs, which is amortized over the term of the line of credit. Effective February 1, 2019, OpenKey had no borrowings outstanding and the $1.5 million revolving credit facility funds were no longer available.\nCost of Revenues for Project Management. Cost of revenues for project management was $3.3 million during 2018 compared to $0 for 2017, due to costs associated with project management revenues from the acquisition of Premier which occurred in August 2018.\nOn April 23, 2018, in connection with the name change by Braemar, the Company entered into the Fifth Amended and Restated Braemar Advisory Agreement, which amends the prior amended and restated advisory agreement only to reflect the name change and does not amend or otherwise alter the rights of any of the parties thereto.\n (1) The increase in expense is primarily due to increases in legal fees and transaction costs related to the acquisition of Premier, development and execution of our ERFP program and our investments in J&S and RED. \nOn January 22, 2019, Ashford Trust acquired The Embassy Suites New York Midtown Manhattan for a purchase price of $195.0 million. In connection with Ashford Trust's acquisition of the hotel, the Company is obligated to provide Ashford Trust with approximately $19.5 million in exchange for FF&E at Ashford Trust's hotel properties that will subsequently be leased back to Ashford Trust rent-free under the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement.\nStrategy Officer of the Company, appointed Mr. Jeremy J. Welter as Co-President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, and appointed David A. Brooks as Chief Transactions Officer, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company, effective March 12, 2018. Also on March 12, 2018, Mr. Douglas A. Kessler ceased to serve as the Company's President and was appointed to serve as Senior Managing Director of the Company, and Mr. David A. Brooks ceased to serve as the Company's Chief Operating Officer.\nOn June 25, 2018, Ashford Inc. announced that it was added as a member of the U.S. small-cap Russell 2000\u00ae Index and the U.S. broad-market Russell 3000\u00ae Index at the conclusion of the Russell indexes annual reconstitution, effective after the market closed on June 22, 2018.\n (7) The $10.6 million increase in project management revenue is due to our acquisition of Premier in August 2018. \nWe conduct our advisory business primarily through an operating entity, Ashford LLC, our project management business through an operating entity, Premier, and our hospitality products and services business primarily through an operating entity, Ashford Services. We own substantially all of our assets and conduct substantially all of our business through Ashford LLC, Premier, and Ashford Services.\nIn connection with the acquisition, on August 8, 2018, Ashford Inc. and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as Rights Agent, entered into a new Rights Agreement. Pursuant to the Rights Agreement, each Right initially entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series C Preferred Stock of the Company at a price of $275 per one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share represented by a Right, subject to adjustment (each as defined under the Rights Agreement). The Amended and Restated Rights Agreement of Ashford Inc. in effect prior to the acquisition of Premier is no longer in effect.\nWe are currently the advisor for Ashford Trust and Braemar. In our capacity as the advisor to Ashford Trust and Braemar, we are responsible for implementing the investment strategies and managing the day-to-day operations of Ashford Trust and Braemar, in each case subject to the supervision and oversight of the respective board of directors of Ashford Trust and Braemar. Ashford Trust commenced operating in August 2003 and is focused on investing in full service hotels in the upscale and upper-upscale segments in the U.S. that have RevPAR generally less than twice the national average. Braemar invests primarily in luxury hotels and resorts with RevPAR of at least twice the U.S. national average. Braemar became a publicly traded company in November 2013 upon the completion of its spin-off from Ashford Trust. Each of Ashford Trust and Braemar is a REIT as defined in the Internal Revenue Code, and the common stock of each of Ashford Trust and Braemar is traded on the NYSE.\nN.A., as administrative agent and letters of credit issuer, and the lenders from time to time party thereto. The Amendment is effective as of March 1, 2018, which is the date the Credit Facility became effective. Pursuant to the Amendment, the financial covenant of consolidated tangible net worth was replaced with the consolidated net worth, and Ashford Inc. is required to maintain consolidated net worth not less than 75% of the consolidated net worth as of December 31, 2017, plus 75% of the net equity proceeds of any future equity issuances by Ashford Inc.\nOn September 28, 2018, we completed a public offering of 270,000 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $74.50 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $20.1 million. The net proceeds from the sale of the shares after discounts and commissions to the underwriters and offering expenses were approximately $18.2 million. We also sold an additional 10,000 shares of common stock to the underwriters on October 10, 2018, in connection with the underwriters' partial exercise of their over-allotment option that had been granted to them in connection with the transaction. The net proceeds from the sale of the over-allotment shares after discounts and commissions to the underwriters were approximately $700,000.\nOn January 2, 2018, the Company issued 8,962 shares of common stock to the OpenKey redeemable noncontrolling interest holder in connection with the purchase of 519,647 shares of the outstanding Class B common stock in OpenKey, Inc. The common stock was issued pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements under the Securities Act provided under Section 4(a)(2) thereunder.\nCertain of our consolidated entities enter into contracts with customers that contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. We determine the standalone selling prices based on our consolidated entities' overall pricing objectives taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the customer and the nature and value of the performance obligations within the applicable contracts.\nCost of Revenues for Audio Visual. Cost of revenues for audio visual expense was $7.8 million for 2017 compared to $0 for 2016 as a result of our acquisition of J&S. Cost of revenues for audio visual for 2017 includes depreciation expense related to audio visual rental pool equipment of $411,000.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract ( ASU 2018-15\u201d). ASU 2018-15 aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software as well as hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2018-15 will have on our consolidated financial statements.\n (2) The increase is primarily due to $2.5 million of expense related to the accelerated vesting of stock option awards upon the death of one of our executive officers, in accordance with the terms of the awards, partially offset by forfeitures. See notes 2, 15 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements. \n________\nOn August 7, 2018, at a Special Meeting of Stockholders, Ashford Inc. shareholders voted to approve certain matters related to Ashford Inc.'s acquisition of the project management business of Remington, including the issuance of 8,120,000 shares of Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock\u201d).\nThe Income Taxes\u201d topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification addresses the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements. The guidance requires us to determine whether tax positions we have taken or expect to take in a tax return are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority based on the technical merits of the positions. Tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not threshold would be recorded as additional tax expense in the current period. We analyze all open tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations for each jurisdiction, which includes the federal jurisdiction and various states. We classify interest and penalties related to underpayment of income taxes as income tax expense. We and our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states and cities, and, beginning November 1, 2017, in Mexico and the Dominican Republic. Tax years 2013 through 2017 remain subject to potential examination by certain federal and state taxing authorities.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments - a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force ( ASU 2016-15\u201d). The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. Certain issues addressed in this guidance include debt payments or debt extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, distributions received from equity method investments and beneficial interests in securitization transactions. We adopted this standard retrospectively effective January 1, 2018, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of cash flows and related disclosures for the year ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the adoption of ASU 2016-15 resulted in the bifurcation of the $2.6 million contingent consideration payment associated with the acquisition of J&S between financing and operating cash flows (included in payments due to affiliates\u201d) in the amounts of $1.2 million and $1.4 million, respectively, within our consolidated statements of cash flows. See notes 5 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOn December 5, 2017, the Board of Directors of Ashford Inc. approved a stock repurchase program (the Repurchase Program\u201d) pursuant to which the Board granted a repurchase authorization to acquire shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share having an aggregate value of up to $20 million. No shares were repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $6.8 million, or 269.7%, to $9.3 million for 2018 compared to 2017, primarily as a result of the amortization of the Premier and J&S definite-lived intangible assets, as well as FF&E additions related to software implementation and the November 2017 J&S acquisition. See note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. Depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, excludes depreciation expense related to audio visual rental pool equipment of $3.8 million and $411,000, respectively, which is\n (1) For variable-rate indebtedness, interest obligations are estimated based on the LIBOR and Prime interest rates as of December 31, 2018. We have assumed that credit facility balances remain outstanding until maturity using the interest rates as of December 31, 2018. \n\nSources and Uses of Cash\n (1) The increase in base advisory fee is due to higher revenue of $24,000 from Ashford Trust and higher revenue of $456,000 from Braemar. \n________\nthe timing of receipt of advisory fees from Ashford Trust and Braemar, timing of paying vendors and timing of operating subsidiaries' receipt of revenues.\nAshford Inc. is a Maryland corporation that provides asset management services, advisory services and other products and services primarily to clients in the hospitality industry. We became a public company in November 2014, when Ashford Trust completed the spin-off of Ashford Inc. through the distribution of approximately 70% of our outstanding common stock to Ashford Trust stockholders and unitholders in Ashford Trust's operating partnership, collectively. Our common stock is listed on the NYSE American. As of March 6, 2019, Ashford Trust held approximately 598,000 shares of our common stock which represented an approximate 24.2% ownership interest in Ashford Inc. and Braemar held approximately 195,000 shares, which represented an approximate 7.9% ownership interest in Ashford Inc.\nOther Income (Expense). Other expense was $73,000 and $162,000 in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nOn September 28, 2018, we completed a public offering of 270,000 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $74.50 per share for gross proceeds of $20.1 million. The net proceeds from the sale of the shares after discounts and commissions to the underwriters and offering expenses were approximately $18.2 million. We also sold an additional 10,000 shares of common stock to the underwriters on October 10, 2018, in connection with the underwriters' partial exercise of their over-allotment option that had been granted to them in connection with the transaction. The net proceeds from the sale of the over-allotment shares after discounts and commissions to the underwriters were approximately $700,000.\n (2) The decrease in incentive advisory fee is due to lower revenue of $596,000 from Braemar. The incentive advisory fee for 2018 includes the first year installment of the Braemar 2018 incentive advisory fee in the amount of $678,000 and the third year installment of the Ashford Trust 2016 incentive advisory fee in the amount of $1.8 million for which payment is due January 2019. The incentive advisory fee for 2017 includes the second year installment of the Ashford Trust 2016 incentive advisory fee in the amount of $1.8 million, which was paid in January 2018, as well as the third year installment of the Braemar 2015 incentive advisory fee in the amount of $1.3 million, which was also paid in January 2018. Incentive fee payments are subject to meeting the December 31 FCCR Condition each year, as defined in our advisory agreements. Ashford Trust's annual total stockholder return did not meet the relevant incentive fee thresholds during the 2018, 2017 and 2015 measurement periods. Braemar's annual total stockholder return did not meet the relevant incentive fee thresholds during the 2017 and 2016 measurement periods. \n (1) The increase in base advisory fee is due to higher revenue of $758,000 from Ashford Trust and higher revenue of $624,000 from Braemar. \nOn April 6, 2017, Pure Wellness entered into a term loan of $375,000 and a line of credit of $100,000 for which the creditor does not have recourse to Ashford Inc. The term loan has a fixed interest rate of 5.00% per annum. On October 1, 2018, we paid off the remaining balance on the term loan. The line of credit has a variable interest rate of Prime Rate plus 1.00%. There is no stated maturity date related to the line of credit as it is payable on demand; accordingly, the balance has been classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheets.\nOn March 23, 2018, our RED operating subsidiary entered into a term loan of $750,000 and a revolving credit facility of $250,000 for which the creditor has recourse to Ashford Inc. Approximately $225,000 of the proceeds from the term loan are held in an escrow account, which is included in our consolidated balance sheet within other assets\u201d as of December 31, 2018. The term loan bears interest at the Prime Rate plus 1.75% and matures on April 5, 2025. The revolving credit facility bears interest at the Prime Rate plus 1.75% and matures on March 5, 2019.\nOn January 16, 2018, the Company closed on the acquisition of a passenger vessel and other assets related to RED Hospitality & Leisure LLC (\"RED\"), a provider of watersports activities and other travel and transportation services. The Company paid $970,000 cash, comprised of a $750,000 deposit paid on December 11, 2017, which was reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as other assets\u201d as of December 31, 2017, and an additional $220,000 paid on January 16, 2018. This transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition recorded at cost, and did not result in the recognition of goodwill. During 2018, our RED operating subsidiary acquired additional passenger vessels for $2.4 million, a ferry for $2.5 million and paid a $400,000 deposit for a new passenger vessel. The Company owns an 80% interest in RED.\nOn March 1, 2019, J&S, our consolidated subsidiary, acquired a privately-held company that conducts the business of BAV Services in the United States ( BAV\u201d) for approximately $9.0 million. BAV is an audio visual rental, staging, and production company, focused on meeting and special event services. As a result of the acquisition, our ownership interest in J&S, which we consolidate under the voting interest model, increased from 85% to approximately 88%. The purchase price consisted of (i) $5.0 million in cash, funded by an existing term loan; (ii) $4.0 million in the form of Ashford Inc. common stock, consisting of 61,387 shares issued on March 1, 2019, which was determined based on an agreed upon value of $3.5 million using a thirty-day weighted average price per share of $57.01 and had an estimated fair value of $3.9 million on the acquisition date, and additional shares with an estimated fair value of $500,000 to be issued 18 months from the acquisition date, subject to certain conditions; and (iii) contingent consideration up to $3.0 million, payable, if earned, 12 to 18 months from the acquisition date. The results of operations of BAV will be included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition beginning in the first quarter of 2019. We are in the process of evaluating the fair value of the net assets acquired through internal studies and third-party valuations and expect to complete a preliminary purchase price allocation in the first quarter of 2019.\nRealized Gain (Loss) on Investments. Realized loss on investments was $0 for 2018 and $294,000 in 2017. The realized loss on investments is related to options on futures contracts and investments held by the AQUA U.S. Fund which was fully dissolved during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSalaries and Benefits Expense. Salaries and benefits expense increased $18.0 million, or 29.4%, to $79.2 million for 2018 compared to 2017. The change in salaries and benefits expense consisted of the following (in thousands):\nWe provide the personnel and services that we believe are necessary to assist each of Ashford Trust and Braemar in conducting their respective businesses. We may also perform similar functions for new or additional platforms. We are not responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the individual hotel properties owned by either Ashford Trust or Braemar, which duties are, and will continue to be, the responsibility of the hotel management companies that operate the hotel properties owned by Ashford Trust and Braemar.\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $51.5 million and $36.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, respectively, and $7.9 million and $9.1 million of restricted cash, respectively.\nTotal Revenue. Total revenue increased $14.0 million, or 20.7% to $81.6 million in 2017. The changes in total revenue consisted of the following (in thousands):\nOn March 1, 2019, J&S, our consolidated subsidiary, acquired a privately-held company that conducts the business of BAV Services in the United States ( BAV\u201d) for approximately $9.0 million. BAV is an audio visual rental, staging, and production company, focused on meeting and special event services. As a result of the acquisition, our ownership interest in J&S, which we consolidate under the voting interest model, increased from 85% to approximately 88%. The purchase price consisted of (i) $5.0 million in cash, funded by an existing term loan; (ii) $4.0 million in the form of Ashford Inc. common stock, consisting of 61,387 shares issued on March 1, 2019, which was determined based on an agreed upon value of $3.5 million using a thirty-day weighted average price per share of $57.01 and had an estimated fair value of $3.9 million on the acquisition date, and additional shares with an estimated fair value of $500,000 to be issued 18 months from the acquisition date, subject to certain conditions; and (iii) contingent consideration up to $3.0 million, payable, if earned, 12 to 18 months from the acquisition date. The results of operations of BAV will be included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition beginning in the first quarter of 2019.

Dividend income was $93,000 and $170,000 for 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to investments held by the AQUA U.S. Fund.\n_______\nEffective January 1, 2019, we acquired a 30% noncontrolling ownership interest in Real Estate Advisory Holdings LLC (\"REA Holdings\"), a real estate advisory firm that provides financing, advisory and property sales services primarily to clients in the hospitality and leisure industry, for a purchase price of approximately $3.0 million which was paid in the form of $2.1 million cash and the issuance of 16,529 shares of our common stock (approximately $890,000) to the seller pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements under the Securities Act, provided under Section 4(a)(2) thereunder. We have an option to acquire an additional 50% of the ownership interests in REA Holdings for $12.5 million beginning on January 1, 2022. Our investment in REA Holdings is accounted for under the equity method as we have significant influence over the voting interest entity.\nRevenue Recognition. Advisory services revenue is reported within our REIT Advisory segment and primarily consists of advisory fees and expense reimbursements that are recognized when services have been rendered. Advisory fees consist of base fees and incentive fees. For Ashford Trust, the base fee was paid quarterly and ranges from 0.50% to 0.70% per annum of the total market capitalization ranging from less than $6.0 billion to greater than $10.0 billion plus, prior to June 26, 2018, the Key Money Asset Management Fee, as defined in the amended and restated advisory agreement, subject to certain minimums. Upon effectiveness of the Enhanced Return Funding Program Agreement and Amendment No. 1 to the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement on June 29, 2018, the base fee is paid monthly and ranges from 0.50% to 0.70% per annum of the total market capitalization ranging from less than $6.0 billion to greater than $10.0 billion plus the Net Asset Fee Adjustment, as defined in the amended and restated advisory agreement, as amended, subject to certain minimums. The Braemar base fee is paid monthly and is fixed at 0.70% of Braemar's total market capitalization plus the Key Money Asset Management Fee, as defined in the advisory agreement, subject to certain minimums. Reimbursements for overhead, internal audit, risk management advisory services and asset management services, including compensation, benefits and travel expense reimbursements, are recognized when services\n (5) The increase in other advisory revenue is due to higher revenue of $277,000 from Braemar as a result of the $5.0 million cash payment received upon stockholder approval of the Fourth Amended and Restated Braemar Advisory Agreement in June 2017. The payment is included in deferred income\u201d on our consolidated balance sheet and is being recognized over the initial ten-year term of the agreement. \nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. This MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included in Item 8. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our results and the timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOther. Other operating expense was $3.3 million and $2.2 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively. Other operating expense includes cost of goods sold and royalties associated with OpenKey, Pure Wellness and RED as well as expense from the increase in fair value of contingent consideration related to the J&S acquisition. See note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.\n (1) The change in cash salaries and benefits expense is primarily due to fluctuations in the number of employees, salary and bonus awards, group insurance costs, payroll taxes and employee participation in the benefits offered. Cash salaries and benefits recorded in 2018 included $1.3 million of severance costs and $716,000 of additional bonus expense recorded upon receiving approval from the board of directors in the first quarter of 2018. The acquisition of J&S in November 2017 contributed $5.8 million to the increase over 2017. \nOn January 15, 2019, the Company entered into the Braemar ERFP agreement with Braemar. Under the Braemar ERFP Agreement, the Company agreed to provide $50 million to Braemar in connection with Braemar's acquisition of hotels recommended by us, with the option to increase the funding commitment to up to $100 million upon mutual agreement by the parties. Under the Braemar ERFP Agreement, the Company is obligated to provide Braemar 10% of the acquired hotel's purchase price in exchange for FF&E at Braemar properties, which is subsequently leased by the Company to Braemar rent-free. In connection with Braemar's acquisition of The Ritz-Carlton Lake Tahoe on January 15, 2019, the Company is obligated to provide Braemar with approximately $10.3 million in exchange for FF&E at Braemar properties, subject to the terms of the Braemar ERFP Agreement.\n (2) The increase in expense is primarily due to our investments in Premier, J&S and RED.  Impairment. Impairment of capitalized software implementation costs was $1.9 million during 2018 compared to $1.1 million for 2017. See notes 2 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements.\n (1) The increase in these costs is primarily due to investments in Pure Wellness, OpenKey and J&S. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in legal expense. \nOn March 1, 2018, the Company and its subsidiary Ashford Hospitality Holdings LLC entered into a $35 million senior revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. The credit facility provides for a three-year revolving line of credit and bears interest at the Base Rate plus 2.00% to 2.50% or LIBOR plus 3.00% to 3.50%, depending on the leverage level of the Company. There is a one-year extension option subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The new credit facility includes the opportunity to expand the borrowing capacity by up to $40 million to an aggregate amount of $75 million, subject to certain conditions. At December 31, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement ( ASU 2018-13\u201d). ASU 2018-13 modifies certain disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements including requiring disclosures on changes in unrealized gains and losses in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements and a requirement to disclose the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2018-13 will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nCertain segments of our business are capital intensive and may require additional financing from time to time. Any additional financings, if and when pursued, may not be available on favorable terms or at all, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and capital resources.\nOn March 21, 2018, Ashford Inc. entered into the First Amendment (the Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement dated March 1, 2018 (the Credit Facility\u201d), with Ashford Hospitality Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of Ashford Inc., Bank of America,\n (9) In connection with our key money transaction with our managed REITs, we lease furniture, fixtures and equipment to Ashford Trust and Braemar at no cost. A portion of the base advisory fee is allocated to lease revenue each period equal to the estimated fair value of the lease payments that would have been made. \nOn March 23, 2018, our RED operating subsidiary entered into a term loan of $750,000 and a revolving credit facility of $250,000 for which the creditor has recourse to Ashford Inc. Approximately $225,000 of the proceeds from the term loan are held in an escrow account, which is included in our consolidated balance sheet within other assets\u201d as of December 31, 2018. The term loan bears interest at the Prime Rate plus 1.75% and matures on April 5, 2025. The revolving credit facility bears interest at the Prime Rate plus 1.75% and matures on March 5, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2018, $118,000 was drawn on the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2018, $132,000 was available under the revolving credit facility. On February 28, 2019, our RED operating subsidiary renewed its revolving credit facility for which the creditor has recourse to Ashford Inc. The revolving credit facility provides RED with available borrowings up to a total of $250,000, bears interest at the Prime Rate plus 1.75% and matures on February 5, 2020.\n\nOn February 28, 2019, our RED operating subsidiary renewed its revolving credit facility for which the creditor has recourse to Ashford Inc. The revolving credit facility provides RED with available borrowings up to a total of $250,000, bears interest at the Prime Rate plus 1.75% and matures on February 5, 2020.\nOn August 8, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Premier, the project management business formerly conducted by certain affiliates of Remington, for a total transaction value of $203 million. As a result, the project management services that were previously provided by Remington Lodging & Hospitality, LLC, ( Remington Lodging\u201d) are now provided by a subsidiary of Ashford Inc. under the respective project management agreement with each customer, including Ashford Trust and Braemar. The purchase price was paid by issuing 8,120,000 shares of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to the sellers of Premier (the Remington Sellers\u201d), primarily MJB Investments, LP (which is wholly-owned by Monty J. Bennett, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our board of directors), and his father Archie Bennett, Jr., the Chairman Emeritus of Ashford Trust (together, the Bennetts\u201d). The Series B Convertible Preferred Stock has a conversion price of $140 per share and would convert into 1,450,000 shares of our common stock. Dividends on the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock are payable at an annual rate of 5.5% in the first year, 6.0% in the second year, and 6.5% in the third year and each year thereafter. In addition to certain separate class voting rights, the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock vote on an as-converted basis with the holders of the common stock on all matters submitted for approval by the holders of our capital stock possessing general voting rights. However, for five years following the closing of the acquisition of Premier, the Remington Sellers and their transferees are subject to certain voting restrictions with respect to shares in excess of 25% of the combined voting power of the Company's outstanding capital stock. The holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock have certain conversion rights upon certain events constituting a change of control of the Company.\n (8) The decrease in investment management reimbursements is due to lower revenue of $820,000 from Ashford Trust. Investment management reimbursements include AIM's management of Ashford Trust's excess cash under the Investment Management Agreement executed in 2017. AIM is not compensated for its services but is reimbursed for all costs and expenses. \nIn addition to the amounts discussed above, as of December 31, 2018, we also have approximately $33.9 million of purchase commitments related to our Enhanced Return Funding Program with Ashford Trust which are contingent upon Ashford Trust acquiring additional hotels. See notes 11 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements.\n (11) The increase in other services revenue is due to higher revenue of $971,000 from Ashford Trust, higher revenue of $816,000 from Braemar and higher revenue of $1.6 million from third parties. Other services revenue relates to other hotel products and services provided by our consolidated subsidiaries, OpenKey, Pure Wellness and RED, to Ashford Trust, Braemar and third parties. \n(Income) Loss from Consolidated Entities Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests. The noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities were allocated a loss of $924,000 in 2018 and a loss of $358,000 in 2017. See notes 2, 13, and 17 to our consolidated financial statements for more details regarding ownership interests, carrying values and allocations.\nOn June 1, 2018, the board of directors of the Company appointed Mr. Robert G. Haiman as Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company, effective June 1, 2018.\nOn April 4, 2018, the Board of Directors of Ashford Inc. approved the updated form of Amended and Restated Indemnification Agreement to be entered into by the Company and each of its directors and officers.\nInterest Income.

Salaries and benefits expense increased $8.8 million, or 16.8%, to $61.2 million in 2017 compared to 2016. The change in salaries and benefits expense consisted of the following (in thousands):\nOn October 31, 2018, Ashford Trust acquired the La Posada de Santa Fe ( La Posada\u201d) in Santa Fe, New Mexico, for a purchase price of $50 million. In connection with Ashford Trust's acquisition of the hotel, the Company was obligated to provide Ashford Trust with approximately $5.0 million in exchange for FF&E for use at Ashford Trust properties, in each case subject to the terms of the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had paid Ashford Trust $5.0 million of cash in exchange for FF&E that was subsequently leased back to Ashford Trust rent-free under the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nInterest Income. Interest income was $329,000 and $244,000 for 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nNet Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities.

These were offset by $4.5 million of dividends paid on our preferred stock, $2.0 million of payments on notes payable and capital leases, $1.2 million of contingent consideration related to the November 2017 acquisition of J&S, $638,000 of loan cost payments, $314,000 in distributions to non-controlling interests and net repayments in advances to employees of $82,000 associated with tax withholdings for restricted stock vesting.\nAcquisitions-We account for acquisitions and investments in businesses as business combinations if the target meets the definition of a business and (a) the target is a VIE and we are the target's primary beneficiary, and therefore we must consolidate its financial statements, or (b) we acquire more than 50% of the voting interest of the target and it was not previously consolidated. We record business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The application of the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. The fair value assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash flows used in financing activities was $42.1 million, which consisted of $44.1 million of distributions to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities, utilization of excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation of $284,000, net repayments in advances to employees of $41,000 associated with tax withholdings for restricted stock vestings, $20,000 for the purchase of treasury shares associated with tax withholdings for restricted stock vestings, and $18,000 for cash redemptions of units, partially offset by $2.4 million of contributions from noncontrolling interests in a consolidated entity.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses increased $17.4 million, or 100.4%, to $34.8 million for 2018 compared to 2017. The change in general and administrative expense consisted of the following (in thousands):\n\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders. Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders changed $23.3 million, or 127.2%, to $5.0 million of net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 ( 2018\u201d) compared to the $18.4 million of net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 ( 2017\u201d) as a result of the factors discussed below.\n (5) The DCP obligation is recorded as a liability at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in earnings. The gain in 2018 and the loss in 2017 are primarily attributable to decreases and increases, respectively, in the fair value of the DCP obligation. See note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.  Cost of Revenues for Audio Visual. Cost of revenues for audio visual was $64.6 million during 2018 compared to $7.8 million for 2017, due to new costs associated with new audio visual revenues from the acquisition of J&S which occurred in November 2017.\n\nIncome Tax (Expense) Benefit. Income tax expense decreased by $20.1 million, from $9.7 million expense in 2017 to $10.4 million benefit in 2018. Current tax expense decreased by $1.9 million, from $3.8 million in 2017 to $1.9 million in 2018, due to lower taxable income which was primarily the result of deductions for bonus depreciation. Deferred tax benefit increased by $18.2 million from $6.0 million expense in 2017 to $12.2 million benefit in 2018. The 2017 period expense was related primarily to the April 2017 legal entity restructuring of the Company, and 2018 benefit was related primarily to the acquisition of Premier, which resulted in the reversal of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in the third quarter of 2018.\n_______\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards-In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, also referred to as ASC 606\u201d Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity shall recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. An entity is required to (a) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (b) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (c) determine the transaction price, (d) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (e) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. In determining the transaction price, an entity may include variable consideration only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized would not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. ASC 606 also specifies the accounting for certain costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer. In addition, the new guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to the Company. Net loss attributable to the Company increased $16.0 million, or 665.9%, to $18.4 million for 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 ( 2016\u201d) as a result of the factors discussed below.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards-In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases ( ASU 2016-02\u201d). The new standard establishes a right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) model that requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases ( ASU 2018-10\u201d) and ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842), Targeted Improvements ( ASU 2018-11\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2018-10 affect only narrow aspects of the guidance issued in the amendments in ASU 2016-02, including but not limited to lease residual value guarantee, rate implicit in the lease, lease term and purchase option. The amendments in ASU 2018-11 provide an optional transition method for adoption of the new standard, which will allow entities to continue to apply the legacy guidance in ASC 840, including its disclosure requirements, in the comparative periods presented in the year of adoption. In December 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-20, Leases (Topic 842), Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors ( ASU 2018-20\u201d). The amendments create a lessor practical expedient applicable to sales and other similar taxes incurred in connection with a lease, and simplify lessor accounting for lessor costs paid by the lessee. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, which will require us to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of 2019 on a modified retrospective basis with an option to use the transition relief provided in ASU 2018-11. The accounting for leases under which we are the lessor remains largely unchanged. While we continue evaluating our lease portfolio to assess the impact that ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements, we expect the primary impact to our consolidated financial statements upon adoption will be the recognition, on a discounted basis, of our future minimum rentals due under noncancellable leases on our consolidated balance sheet resulting in the recording of ROU assets and lease obligations estimated to be between $23.6 million and $28.8 million. Upon adoption, we will not recognize lease revenue for our rent-free leases of FF&E commencing on or after the adoption date under our ERFP agreements with our related parties Ashford Trust and Braemar. We expect to elect the package of practical expedients in transition that permits entities not to reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, to retain the lease classification and to continue to capitalize initial direct costs for any leases that exist prior to adoption of the standard. We expect to use the transition method in ASU 2018-11 that allows us to adopt the new lease standard effective January 1, 2019, and not reevaluate or recast prior periods. However, we are still evaluating the available transition methods. We are implementing repeatable processes to manage ongoing lease data collection and analysis, and evaluating accounting policies and internal controls that will be impacted by the new standards.\nNet (Income) Loss Attributable to Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests. Net losses of $1.5 million and $1.1 million were allocated to redeemable noncontrolling interests in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Redeemable noncontrolling interests represented ownership interests in Ashford Holdings and certain of our consolidated subsidiaries. Prior to April 6, 2017, the noncontrolling interests represented ownership interests in Ashford LLC. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of ownership interests, carrying values and allocations, see notes 2, 14, and 17 to our consolidated financial statements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $23.2 million, which was attributable to the acquisition of a controlling interest in J&S for $19.0 million (net of cash acquired of approximately $200,000), purchases of computer software and FF&E of $3.6 million, a $750,000 deposit for certain assets related to RED, partially offset by proceeds from the disposal of FF&E of $15,000 and $129,000 of cash acquired in the acquisition of Pure Wellness.\nOn August 31, 2018, our RED operating subsidiary entered into a term loan of $1.8 million for which the creditor has recourse to Ashford Inc. The term loan bears interest at the Prime Rate plus 2.00% and matures on February 1, 2029.\nOur long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for operating expenses attributable to paying our employees, investments to grow our business, and our ERFP and certain recent subsidiary financing transactions noted below. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, including net cash provided by operations, future equity issuances and availability under our revolving credit facilities.\n (10) The increase in other services revenue is due to higher revenue of $993,000 from Ashford Trust, higher revenue of $41,000 from Braemar and higher revenue of $1.3 million from third parties. Other services revenue is associated with the provision of other hotel products and services by our consolidated subsidiaries, Pure Wellness and OpenKey, to Ashford Trust, Braemar and third parties. \nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $959,000 and $83,000 for 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to the notes payable, lines of credit and capital leases held by our consolidated subsidiaries. See notes 2 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements.\n (5) The DCP obligation is recorded as a liability in accordance with the applicable authoritative accounting guidance. The DCP obligation is carried at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in earnings. The 2017 loss is primarily attributable to an increase in the fair value of the DCP obligation whereas the fair value of the DCP obligation decreased in 2016. See note 16 to our consolidated financial statements. \n (14) See note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of segment reporting. \nDividend Income. Dividend income was $0 and $93,000 for 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to investments held by the AQUA U.S. Fund which was fully dissolved during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASU 2016-01\u201d), which requires an entity to: (i) measure equity investments at fair value through net income, with certain exceptions; (ii) present in OCI the changes in instrument-specific credit risk for financial liabilities measured using the fair value option; (iii) present financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset; (iv) calculate the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes based on an exit price; and (v) assess a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to unrealized losses of AFS debt securities in combination with other deferred tax assets. ASU 2016-01 provides an election to subsequently measure certain nonmarketable equity investments at cost less any impairment and adjusted for certain observable price changes. It also requires a qualitative impairment assessment of such equity investments and amends certain fair value disclosure requirements. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017,", "item_7_text": "The table below summarizes future obligations as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nhave been rendered. We record advisory revenue for equity grants of Ashford Trust and Braemar common stock and LTIP units awarded to our officers and employees in connection with providing advisory services equal to the fair value of the award in proportion to the requisite service period satisfied during the period, as well an offsetting expense in an equal amount included in salaries and benefits.\u201d\n (4) The increase in non-cash stock/unit-based compensation revenue is due to higher revenue of $14.2 million from Ashford Trust and higher revenue of $8.2 million from Braemar. Non-cash stock/unit-based compensation revenue is associated with equity grants of Ashford Trust's and Braemar's common stock and LTIP units awarded to officers and employees of Ashford Inc. for which we recorded an offsetting expense in an equal amount included in salaries and benefits.\u201d During 2018, $6.7 million of non-cash stock/unit-based compensation revenue, including $4.5 million and $2.2 million from Ashford Trust and Braemar, respectively, related to accelerated vesting, in accordance with the terms of the awards, as a result of the death of an executive in March 2018. \nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses increased $909,000, or 5.5%, to $17.4 million in 2017 compared to 2016. The change in general and administrative expense consisted of the following (in thousands): \n (4) Equity grants of Ashford Trust's and Braemar's common stock and LTIP units are awarded to our officers and employees as part of our advisory agreements with each company, for which we record offsetting revenue in an equal amount. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in the fair value of equity grants, in addition to $6.7 million of compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting of equity awards upon the death of one of our executive officers, in accordance with the terms of the awards. See notes 2 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements. \nOn February 26, 2019, Ashford Trust acquired the Hilton Santa Cruz/Scotts Valley, in Santa Cruz, California, for a purchase price of $50.0 million. In connection with Ashford Trust's acquisition of the hotel, the Company is obligated to provide Ashford Trust with approximately $5.0 million in exchange for FF&E at Ashford Trust's hotel properties that will subsequently be leased back to Ashford Trust rent-free under the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement.\nAmortization of Loan Costs. Amortization of loan costs was $241,000 and $39,000 for 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to the notes payable and lines of credit held by our consolidated subsidiaries. See notes 2 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense). Income tax expense increased $8.9 million, from $780,000 in 2016 to $9.7 million in 2017. The increase in income tax expense is primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance of our deferred tax asset caused by the legal restructuring of our organizational structure in the second quarter of 2017 and enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017. As a result, our effective tax rates on income (loss) before income taxes for 2017 and 2016 were (92.9%) and (6.7%), respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in key line items from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOther Income (Expense). Other expense was $834,000 and $73,000 in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOn June 29, 2018, Ashford Trust acquired the Hilton Old Town Alexandria in Alexandria, Virginia, for a purchase price of $111.0 million. In connection with Ashford Trust's acquisition of the hotel, the Company was obligated to provide Ashford Trust with approximately $11.1 million in exchange for FF&E for use at Ashford Trust properties, in each case subject to the terms of the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had paid Ashford Trust $11.1 million of cash in exchange for FF&E that was subsequently leased back to Ashford Trust rent-free under the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement.\n (13) Claims management services include revenues earned from providing insurance claim assessment and administration services. \nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805) - Clarifying the Definition of a Business ( ASU 2017-01\u201d), which clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether a transaction should be accounted for as an acquisition (or disposal) of an asset or a business. We have adopted this standard effective January 1, 2018.\nOn June 26, 2018, the Company entered into the Enhanced Return Funding Program Agreement and Amendment No. 1 to the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement (the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement\u201d) with Ashford Trust. The independent members of the board of directors of each of the Company and Ashford Trust, with the assistance of separate and independent legal counsel, engaged to negotiate the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement on behalf of the Company and Ashford Trust, respectively. Under the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement, the Company agreed to provide $50 million to Ashford Trust in connection with Ashford Trust's acquisition of hotels recommended by us, with the option to increase the funding commitment to up to $100 million upon mutual agreement by the parties. The Company is obligated to provide Ashford Trust 10% of the acquired hotel's purchase price in exchange for FF&E, which is subsequently leased to Ashford Trust rent-free. The Company records ERFP obligations in our consolidated balance sheet as other assets\u201d and other liabilities.\u201d Ashford Trust must provide reasonable advance notice to the Company to request ERFP funds in accordance with the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement. The Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement requires that the Company acquire the related FF&E either at the time of the property acquisition or at any time generally within two years of Ashford Trust acquiring the hotel property. The Company recognizes the related depreciation tax deduction at the time such FF&E is purchased by the Company and placed into service at Ashford Trust properties. However, the timing of the FF&E being purchased and placed into service is subject to uncertainties outside of the Company's control that could delay the realization of any tax benefit associated with the purchase of FF&E. See notes 11 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\n (3) As a result of our spin-off, we assumed all of the unrecognized equity-based compensation associated with prior Ashford Trust equity grants. As a result, we continued to recognize equity-based compensation expense related to these grants through the final vesting date in April 2017. The expense decreased each year as the Ashford Trust equity grants became fully vested. See notes 2 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements. \nOn April 2, 2018, Ashford Inc. announced the death of long-time executive David A. Brooks, who served in multiple leadership roles with the Company since 2003.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in key line items from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\nOn November 8, 2018, OpenKey renewed the Loan and Security Agreement that expired in October 2018 for a revolving credit facility in the amount of $1.5 million. The credit facility is secured by all of OpenKey's assets and matures on April 30, 2020, with an interest rate of Prime Rate plus 2.75%. Creditors do not have recourse to Ashford Inc. At December 31, 2018 and\n__________\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $1.4 million, or 115.2%, to $2.5 million for 2017 compared to 2016, primarily as a result of furniture, fixtures and equipment additions related to software implementation, key money assets and the 2017 J&S acquisition. The increase was also due to the amortization of intangible assets related to the 2017 acquisitions of J&S and Pure Wellness. See note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, excludes depreciation expense related to audio visual rental pool equipment of $411,000, which is included in cost of revenues for audio visual.\nOn March 21, 2018, Ashford Inc. entered into the First Amendment (the Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement dated March 1, 2018 (the Credit Facility\u201d), with Ashford Hospitality Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of Ashford Inc., Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and letters of credit issuer, and the lenders from time to time party thereto. The Amendment is effective as of March 1, 2018, which is the date the Credit Facility became effective. Pursuant to the Amendment, the financial covenant of consolidated tangible net worth was replaced with consolidated net worth, and Ashford Inc. is required to maintain consolidated net worth not less than 75% of the consolidated net worth as of December 31, 2017, plus 75% of the net equity proceeds of any future equity issuances by Ashford Inc.\nIf our investment involves the acquisition of an asset or group of assets that does not meet the definition of a business, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. An asset acquisition is recorded at cost, which includes capitalizing transaction costs, and does not result in the recognition of goodwill.\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary for operating expenses primarily attributable to paying our employees. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations, existing cash balances and, if necessary, short-term borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which we believe will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our existing non-discretionary obligations and anticipated ordinary course operating expenses for at least the next twelve months.\n\n (2) Incentive advisory fee includes the second year installment of the 2016 incentive fee in the amount of $1.8 million for 2017, earned in connection with our advisory agreement with Ashford Trust and the third year installment of the 2015 incentive fee in the amount of $1.3 million for 2017, earned in connection with our advisory agreement with Braemar. No incentive fee was earned from Ashford Trust or Braemar for the 2017 measurement period. \nIn the normal course of business, we may form or invest in partnerships or joint ventures. We evaluate each partnership and joint venture to determine whether the entity is a VIE. If the entity is determined to be a VIE, we assess whether we are the primary beneficiary and need to consolidate the entity. For further discussion see notes 1 and 2 to our consolidated financial statements.\n2017, there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility. In connection with the 2018 renewal, OpenKey granted the creditors a 10-year warrant to purchase approximately 23,000 shares of OpenKey's preferred stock at $1.61 per share with an estimated fair value of $26,000. The fair value of the warrants was recorded in noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities and debt issuance costs, which is amortized over the term of the line of credit.\n________\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, investing activities used net cash flows of $4.9 million, which was attributable to purchases of computer software, furniture, fixtures and equipment of $6.2 million partially offset by a distribution from an investment in an unconsolidated investment entity of $1.4 million.\ncredit losses for most financial assets held. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for periods beginning after December 15, 2018. In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. ASU 2016-13 introduced an expected credit loss methodology for the impairment of financial assets measured at amortized cost basis. That methodology replaces the probable, incurred loss model for those assets. ASU 2018-19 is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update 2018-270, which has been deleted. Additionally, the amendments clarify that receivables arising from operating leases are not within the scope of Subtopic 326-20. Instead, impairment of receivables arising from operating leases should be accounted for in accordance with Topic 842, Leases. We are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-13 will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n (6) The $72.0 million increase in audio visual revenue is due to our acquisition of J&S in November 2017. \nOn April 6, 2018, Ashford Inc. signed a definitive agreement to acquire the project management business of Remington Holdings, L.P. ( Remington\u201d).\nIncentive advisory fees are measured annually in each year that Ashford Trust's and/or Braemar's annual total stockholder return exceeds the average annual total stockholder return for each company's respective peer group, subject to the FCCR Condition, as defined in the respective advisory agreements. Incentive advisory fees are paid over a three-year period and each payment is subject to the FCCR Condition, which relates to the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges for Ashford Trust or Braemar, as applicable. Historically, during the incentive advisory fee measurement period (i.e. the first year of each three year period), incentive advisory fees have been accrued (or reversed) quarterly based on the amount that would be due pursuant to the applicable advisory agreements as of the interim balance sheet date. The second and third year installments of incentive advisory fees have been recognized as revenue on a pro-rata basis each quarter for the amounts determined in the first year measurement period, subject to the December 31 FCCR Condition each year. Effective with our January 1, 2018 adoption of ASC 606, we no longer record the first year's installment of incentive advisory fee revenue in interim periods prior to the fourth quarter. Prior to measurement in the fourth quarter of each year, our first year installment of incentive advisory fees are subject to significant fluctuation (i.e. based on annual total stockholder returns) and are contingent on a future event during the measurement period (e.g. meeting the FCCR Condition). Accordingly, incentive advisory fees will generally be recognized only upon measurement in the fourth quarter of the first year of the three year period. The second and third year installments of incentive advisory fees are recognized as revenue on a pro-rata basis each quarter as such amounts are not subject to significant reversal.\nIn connection with Ashford Trust's acquisitions of The Embassy Suites New York Midtown Manhattan on January 22, 2019 and the Hilton Santa Cruz/Scotts Valley on February 26, 2019, the Company is obligated to provide Ashford Trust with approximately $19.5 million and $5.0 million, respectively, for a total obligation of $24.5 million in exchange for FF&E at Ashford Trust properties, subject to the terms of the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement. After consideration of the $16.1 million ERFP obligations funded in 2018 and the $24.5 million ERFP obligations incurred in connection with Ashford Trust's acquisitions in 2019, the Company has $9.4 million remaining of its initial $50 million ERFP funding commitment to Ashford Trust.\n (2) Distributions under the deferred compensation plan are made in cash, unless the participant has elected Ashford Inc. common stock as the investment option, in which any such distributions would be made in Ashford Inc. common stock. The deferred compensation plan obligation is carried at fair value based on the underlying investment(s). See note 16 to our consolidated financial statements. \nProject management revenue primarily consists of revenue generated within our Premier segment by providing development and construction, capital improvements, refurbishment, project management, and other services such as purchasing, interior design, freight management, and construction management services at properties. Premier receives fees for these services and recognizes revenue over time as services are provided to the customer. Project management revenue also includes revenue from reimbursable costs for accounting, overhead and project manager services provided to projects owned by affiliates of Ashford Trust, Braemar and other owners.\nNet Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $28.1 million primarily due to $16.1 million of capital expenditures related to our ERFP agreement with Ashford Trust, $8.9 million of capital expenditures for audio visual equipment and computer software, and $5.5 million of capital expenditures for RED marine vessels, partially offset by $2.3 million of cash acquired in the acquisition of Premier and net proceeds from the disposal of FF&E of $140,000.\n (1) The change in cash salaries and benefits expense is primarily due to fluctuations in the number of employees, salary and bonus awards, group insurance costs, payroll taxes and employee participation in the benefits offered. The acquisitions of J&S and Pure Wellness in 2017 contributed $868,000 and $667,000, respectively, to the $2.2 million increase over 2016. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash flows used in financing activities were $44.5 million. These cash outflows consisted of $55.3 million of distributions to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities primarily related to the AQUA Fund that is now dissolved, net advances to employees of $433,000 associated with tax withholdings for restricted stock vestings, $305,000 of payments on notes payable, $28,000 of loan cost payments, and $24,000 for the repurchase of common stock, partially offset by $10.0 million of proceeds from the term loan to finance the acquisition of J&S, $983,000 of contributions from noncontrolling interests in a consolidated entity and net borrowings on the J&S revolving credit facility of $583,000.\nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2018-07\u201d) in the third quarter of 2018, equity-based awards granted to non-employees were accounted for at fair value based on the market price of the awards at period end, which resulted in recording expense equal to the fair value of the award in proportion to the requisite service period satisfied during the period. After the adoption of ASU 2018-07 in the third quarter of 2018, equity-based awards granted to non-employees are measured at the grant date and expensed ratably over the vesting period based on the original measurement date as the grant date. This results in the recording of expense equal to the ratable amount of the grant date fair value based on the requisite service period satisfied during the period.\nOur accounting policies are fully described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d We believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, representing those policies considered most vital to the portrayal of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations and requiring management's most difficult, subjective, and complex judgments.\nOverview\nIn connection with the acquisition of Premier, we effected a holding company reorganization. The change in holding company organizational structure was effected by a merger, pursuant to which each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of our predecessor publicly-traded parent Ashford OAINC Inc. (formerly named Ashford Inc.) ( Old Ashford\u201d) was converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company having the same rights, powers and preferences and the same qualifications, limitations and restrictions as a share of common stock of Old Ashford. As a result of the foregoing, we became the successor issuer of Old Ashford under Rule 12g-3 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act\u201d). Our common stock continues to be listed on the NYSE American under the symbol AINC.\u201d\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments. Unrealized gain on investments was $203,000 for 2017 and $2.3 million for 2016, primarily related to investments held by the AQUA U.S. Fund. The unrealized gain (loss) on investments is based on changes in closing market prices during the period.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $83,000 and $0 for 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to the notes payable, lines of credit and capital leases held by our consolidated subsidiaries. See notes 2 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements.\n (3) The increase in reimbursable expenses revenue is due to higher revenue of $1.5 million from Ashford Trust and lower revenue of $700,000 from Braemar. Reimbursable expenses include overhead, internal audit, insurance claims advisory and asset management services. \nDebt placement fees include revenues earned from providing debt placement services by Lismore Capital, our wholly-owned subsidiary. These fees are recognized based on a stated percentage of the loan amount when services have been rendered and the subject loan has closed.\n (4) Equity grants of Ashford Trust's and Braemar's common stock and LTIP units are awarded to our officers and employees as part of our advisory agreements with each company, for which we record offsetting revenue in an equal amount. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in the fair value of equity grants. See notes 2 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements. \n (9) The increase in debt placement fee revenue is due to an unusually high volume of debt financings during the second quarter of 2018, primarily from Ashford Trust. We recorded higher revenue of $4.2 million from Ashford Trust and higher revenue of $775,000 from Braemar. Debt placement fees include revenues earned from providing debt placement services by Lismore Capital, our wholly-owned subsidiary. \n (6) The increase in audio visual revenue is due to higher revenue of $9.2 million from third parties, as a result of our acquisition of J&S. \n\nAmortization of Loan Costs. Amortization of loan costs was $39,000 and $0 for 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to the notes payable and lines of credit held by our consolidated subsidiaries. See notes 2 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements.\nare based on management's estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. Significant assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset, if applicable. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be exposed to potential impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill.\nRealized Gain (Loss) on Investment in Unconsolidated Entity. We had no realized gain or loss on an investment in an unconsolidated entity in 2017. We recorded a realized loss in an unconsolidated investment fund of $3.6 million in 2016 for which AIM was the investment advisor.\nAs required for disclosure under the Fifth Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement (the Fifth Amended and Restated Braemar Advisory Agreement\u201d), for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2018, the total incremental expenses incurred (including all reimbursable expenses), as reasonably determined, in connection with providing services to Braemar under the Fifth Amended and Restated Braemar Advisory Agreement was $10.2 million.\n (12) Indicates REIT advisory revenue. \n (3) As a result of our spin-off, we assumed all of the unrecognized equity-based compensation associated with prior Ashford Trust equity grants. As a result, we continued to recognize equity-based compensation expense related to these grants through the final vesting date in April 2017. The expense decreased each year as the Ashford Trust equity grants became fully vested. See notes 2 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements. \nOn June 26, 2018, the Company entered into the Enhanced Return Funding Program Agreement and Amendment No. 1 to the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement (the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement\u201d) with Ashford Trust. The independent members of the board of directors of each of the Company and Ashford Trust, with the assistance of separate and independent legal counsel, engaged to negotiate the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement on behalf of the Company and Ashford Trust, respectively. Under the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement, the Company agreed to provide $50 million to Ashford Trust in connection with Ashford Trust's acquisition of hotels recommended by us, with the option to increase the funding commitment to up to $100 million upon mutual agreement by the parties. The Company is obligated to provide Ashford Trust 10% of the acquired hotel's purchase price in exchange for FF&E, which is subsequently leased to Ashford Trust rent-free. The Company records ERFP obligations in our consolidated balance sheet as other assets\u201d and other liabilities.\u201d Ashford Trust must provide reasonable advance notice to the Company to request ERFP funds in accordance with the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement. The Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement requires that the Company acquire the related FF&E either at the time of the property acquisition or at any time generally within two years of Ashford Trust acquiring the hotel property. The Company recognizes the related depreciation tax deduction at the time such FF&E is purchased by the Company and placed into service at Ashford Trust properties. However, the timing of the FF&E being purchased and placed into service is subject to uncertainties outside of the Company's control that could delay the realization of any tax benefit associated with the purchase of FF&E. In connection with Ashford Trust's acquisition of the Hilton Old Town Alexandria and La Posada de Santa Fe in 2018, and subject to the terms of the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement, the Company was obligated to provide Ashford Trust with approximately $16.1 million of FF&E at Ashford Trust properties. The $16.1 million of FF&E was purchased and leased to Ashford Trust with an effective date of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had no remaining balance in our ERFP obligation to Ashford Trust in respect of hotels already acquired by Ashford Trust.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the TCJA into legislation. Under ASC 740, the effects of changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which the new legislation is enacted. In the case of U.S. federal income taxes, the enactment date is the date the bill becomes law (i.e., upon presidential signature). With respect to this legislation, we recorded a one-time income tax expense of approximately $303,000 due to a revaluation of our net deferred tax assets resulting from the decrease in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% and elimination of the ability to carryback net operating losses generated after December 31, 2017. Additionally on December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the TCJA. The Company recognized the provisional tax impacts related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, we have finalized our accounting for the impacts of the TCJA. There were no changes to the provision amounts previously recorded.\n (4) The decrease in non-cash stock/unit-based compensation revenue is due to higher revenue of $2.6 million from Ashford Trust and lower revenue of $5.5 million from Braemar. Non-cash stock/unit-based compensation revenue is associated with equity grants of Ashford Trust's and Braemar's common stock and LTIP units awarded to officers and employees of Ashford Inc. for which we recorded an offsetting expense in an equal amount included in salaries and benefits.\u201d \nincluding interim periods within those fiscal years. Certain provisions of ASU 2016-01 are eligible for early adoption. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-03, as technical corrections and improvements to amend and clarify certain aspects of the guidance issued in ASU 2016-01. We have adopted this standard effective January 1, 2018, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nTotal Revenue. Total revenue increased $113.9 million, or 139.7%, to $195.5 million for 2018 compared to 2017 due to the following (in thousands):\nOn March 12, 2018, the Board of Directors of Ashford Inc. appointed Mr. J. Robison Hays, III, as Co-President and Chief\n (2) The increase in expense is due to additional stock options granted in 2017 with a three year vesting period for which there was no related expense in 2016. See notes 2, 15 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements. \nincluded in cost of revenues for audio visual, and also excludes depreciation expense related to marine vessels of $172,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018, which is included in other\u201d operating expense.\n (3) Distributions under the AIM incentive plan will be made in cash within 45 days of March 31, 2019. The AIM incentive plan obligation is carried at amortized fair value. See note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.  Some of our loan agreements contain financial and other covenants. If we violate these covenants, we could be required to repay a portion of our indebtedness before maturity at a time when we might be unable to arrange financing for such repayment on attractive terms, if at all. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2018.\nOn November 1, 2017, our J&S operating subsidiary entered into a series of financing transactions for which the creditors do not have recourse to Ashford Inc., including a $10.0 million term loan to finance the acquisition of J&S. The term loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.25% and matures on November 1, 2022. Net deferred loan costs associated with this financing of $183,000 and $226,000, respectively, are included as a reduction to notes payable on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. In connection with the term loan, the subsidiary entered into an interest rate cap with an initial notional amount totaling $5.0 million and a strike rate of 4.0%. The fair value of the interest rate cap at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was not material. The subsidiary also entered into a $3.0 million revolving credit facility which bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.25% and matures on November 1, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2018, $21.8 million was drawn and approximately $20.8 million of payments were made on the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2018, approximately $1.3 million of credit was available under the revolving credit facility and approximately $1.7 million was outstanding. These debt agreements contain various financial covenants that, among other things, require the maintenance of certain fixed charge coverage ratios. As of December 31, 2018, our J&S operating subsidiary was in compliance with all financial covenants.\nRecent Developments\n (2) The decrease in these costs is primarily due to software project timing.  Impairment. Impairment of capitalized software implementation costs was $1.1 million during 2017 compared to $0 for 2016. See notes 2 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements.\n (5) The increase in other advisory revenue is due to higher revenue of $244,000 from Braemar as a result of the $5.0 million cash payment received upon stockholder approval of the Fourth Amended and Restated Braemar Advisory Agreement in June 2017. The payment is included in deferred income\u201d on our consolidated balance sheet and is being recognized over the initial ten-year term of the agreement. \n(Income) Loss from Consolidated Entities Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests. The noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities were allocated losses of $358,000 in 2017 and $8.9 million in 2016. See notes 2, 13, and 17 to our consolidated financial statements for more details regarding ownership interests, carrying values and allocations.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ( ASU 2016-13\u201d). ASU 2016-13 sets forth an expected credit loss\u201d impairment model to replace the current incurred loss\u201d method of recognizing credit losses. The standard requires measurement and recognition of expected\n (10) In connection with our legacy key money transactions with our managed REITs, we lease FF&E to Ashford Trust and Braemar rent-free. A portion of the base advisory fee is allocated to lease revenue each period equal to the estimated fair value of the lease payments that would have been made. \n (8) The increase in debt placement fee revenue is due to higher revenue of $913,000 from Ashford Trust and $224,000 from Braemar. Debt placement fees include revenues earned through provision of debt placement services by Lismore Capital, our wholly-owned subsidiary. \nOn August 8, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Premier, the project management business formerly conducted by certain affiliates of Remington, for a total transaction value of $203 million. As a result, the project management services that were previously provided by Remington Lodging & Hospitality, LLC, ( Remington Lodging\u201d) are now provided by a subsidiary of Ashford Inc. under the respective project management agreement with each customer, including Ashford Trust and Braemar. The purchase price was paid by issuing 8,120,000 shares of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to the sellers of Premier (the Remington Sellers\u201d), primarily MJB Investments, LP (which is wholly-owned by Monty J. Bennett, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our board of directors), and his father Archie Bennett, Jr., the Chairman Emeritus of Ashford Trust (together, the Bennetts\u201d). The Series B Convertible Preferred Stock has a conversion price of $140 per share and would convert into 1,450,000 shares of our common stock. Dividends on the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock are payable at an annual rate of 5.5% in the first year, 6.0% in the second year, and 6.5% in the third year and each year thereafter. In addition to certain separate class voting rights, the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock vote on an as-converted basis with the holders of the common stock on all matters submitted for approval by the holders of our capital stock possessing general voting rights. However, for five years following the closing of the acquisition of Premier, the Remington Sellers and their transferees are subject to certain voting restrictions with respect to shares in excess of 25% of the combined voting power of the Company's outstanding capital stock. The holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock have certain conversion rights upon certain events constituting a change of control of the Company. See note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.\nrelated to software implementation costs from Ashford Trust and Braemar of $1.7 million and $126,000, respectively, which was partially offset by the impairment of the related capitalized software, as discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, in the amount of $1.1 million. See note 17 to our consolidated financial statements.\n (11) Indicates REIT advisory revenue. \nOn August 31, 2018, our RED operating subsidiary entered into a term loan of $1.8 million for which the creditor has recourse to Ashford Inc. The term loan bears interest at the Prime Rate plus 2.00% and matures on February 1, 2029.\n (3) The increase in reimbursable expenses revenue is due to higher revenue of $305,000 from Ashford Trust offset by lower revenue of $173,000 from Braemar. Reimbursable expenses include overhead, internal audit, risk management advisory and asset management services. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized income from reimbursable expenses \nImpairment of Goodwill-Goodwill is assigned to reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination as of the acquisition date. We assess goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1, or more frequently, if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. In the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, we typically perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the fair value of the goodwill is more likely than not impaired. In considering the qualitative approach, we evaluated factors including, but not limited to, the operational stability and the overall financial performance of the reporting units. We may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value and, if applicable, record an impairment charge based on the excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit based on either a market valuation approach or an analysis of discounted projected future operating cash flows using a discount rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model. Based on the results of our annual impairment assessment, no impairment of goodwill was indicated. No indicators of impairment were identified from the date of our impairment assessment through December 31, 2018.\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments. Unrealized gain on investments was $0 for 2018 and $203,000 for 2017, primarily related to investments held by the AQUA U.S. Fund which was fully dissolved during the year ended December 31, 2017. The unrealized gain (loss) on investments is based on changes in closing market prices during the period.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment ( ASU 2017-04\u201d), which removes the requirement to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount as part of step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. As a result, under ASU 2017-04, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. However, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. In addition, ASU 2017-04 clarifies that an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We are evaluating the impact that ASU 2017-04 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted the new standard using the modified retrospective approach. Based on our assessment, adoption of the new guidance did not require a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening retained earnings on January 1, 2018. We expect the new standard's impact on net income will be immaterial on an ongoing annual basis; however, the Company does anticipate that the new standard will have an impact on its revenues in interim periods due to timing. The primary impact of adopting the new standard relates to the timing of recognition of incentive advisory fees, which are a form of variable consideration and therefore must be (i) deferred until such fees are probable of not being subject to significant reversal, and (ii) tied to a performance obligation in the contract with the customer so that revenue recognition depicts the transfer of the related advisory services to the customer. Accordingly, the Company no longer records incentive advisory fee revenue in interim periods prior to the fourth quarter of the year in which the incentive fee is measured. The Company expects that this could impact its revenues in future interim periods, but we are unable to estimate the impact because future incentive advisory fees are calculated based on future changes in total stockholder return of our REIT clients compared to the total stockholder return of their respective peer group. There are no material changes in revenue recognition for audio visual, investment management reimbursements, debt placement fees, claims management services revenue, lease revenue or other services revenue. See note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our adoption of ASC 606.\nOther. Other operating expense was $2.2 million and $0 for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Other operating expense includes cost of goods sold and royalties associated with Pure Wellness and OpenKey as well as expense from the increase in fair value of contingent consideration related to the J&S acquisition.\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on Investment in Unconsolidated Entity. We recorded no unrealized gain (loss) on investment in unconsolidated entities in 2017. We recorded an unrealized gain in an unconsolidated investment fund of $2.1 million in 2016 for which AIM was the investment advisor.\nNet (Income) Loss Attributable to Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests. The redeemable noncontrolling interests were allocated a loss of $1.4 million in 2018 and a loss of $1.5 million in 2017. Redeemable noncontrolling interests represented ownership interests in Ashford Holdings and certain of our consolidated subsidiaries. Prior to April 6, 2017, the noncontrolling interests represented ownership interests in Ashford LLC. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of ownership interests, carrying values and allocations, see notes 2, 14, and 17 to our consolidated financial statements.\nEffective January 1, 2019, we acquired a 30% noncontrolling ownership interest in Real Estate Advisory Holdings LLC (\"REA Holdings\"), a real estate advisory firm that provides financing, advisory and property sales services primarily to clients in the hospitality and leisure industry, for a purchase price of approximately $3.0 million which was paid in the form of $2.1 million cash and the issuance of 16,529 shares of our common stock (approximately $890,000) to the seller pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements under the Securities Act, provided under Section 4(a)(2) thereunder. We have an option to acquire an additional 50% of the ownership interests in REA Holdings for $12.5 million beginning on January 1, 2022. Our investment in REA Holdings is accounted for under the equity method as we have significant influence over the voting interest entity.\nOn March 1, 2018, the Company and its subsidiary Ashford Hospitality Holdings LLC entered into a $35 million senior revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. The credit facility provides for a three-year revolving line of credit and bears interest at the Base Rate plus 2.00% to 2.50% or LIBOR plus 3.00% to 3.50%, depending on the leverage level of the Company. There is a one-year extension option subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The new credit facility includes the opportunity to expand the borrowing capacity by up to $40 million to an aggregate amount of $75 million, subject to certain conditions. At December 31, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility.\nNet Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities. Operating activities provided net cash flows of $21.5 million and $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to an increase in earnings as well as the timing of settlements with related parties and payments to vendors, partially offset by $10.4 million of transaction costs related to the acquisition of Premier, $1.4 million of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of J&S and the timing of operating subsidiaries' receipt of revenues. In connection with our Fourth Amended and Restated Braemar Advisory Agreement, we received a $5.0 million cash payment in June 2017 from Braemar which positively impacted operating cash flows in the year ended December 31, 2017. The higher cash flows provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily a result of the liquidation of investments in securities held by the AQUA U.S. Fund during the year ended December 31, 2016. Cash flows from operations is impacted by\n________\nRealized Gain (Loss) on Investments. Realized loss on investments was $294,000 for 2017 and $10.1 million in 2016. The realized loss on investments is related to investments held by the AQUA U.S. Fund and options on futures contracts.\nIncome Taxes-We are a taxable corporation for federal and state income tax purposes. Income tax expense includes U.S. federal and state income taxes and, beginning November 1, 2017, Mexico and Dominican Republic income taxes. In accordance with authoritative accounting guidance, we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.\n (7) The increase in investment management reimbursements is due to higher revenue of $2.0 million from Ashford Trust. Investment management reimbursements include AIM's management of Ashford Trust's excess cash under the Investment Management Agreement executed in 2017. AIM is not compensated for its services but is reimbursed for all costs and expenses. \nOn January 15, 2019, the Company entered into the Enhanced Return Funding Program Agreement and Amendment No. 1 to the Fifth Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement (the Braemar ERFP Agreement\u201d) with Braemar. The independent members of the board of directors of each of the Company and Braemar, with the assistance of separate and independent legal counsel, engaged to negotiate the Braemar ERFP Agreement on behalf of the Company and Braemar, respectively. Under the Braemar ERFP Agreement, the Company agreed to provide $50 million to Braemar in connection with Braemar's acquisition of hotels recommended by us, with the option to increase the funding commitment to up to $100 million upon mutual agreement by the parties. Under the Braemar ERFP Agreement, the Company is obligated to provide Braemar 10% of the acquired hotel's purchase price in exchange for FF&E, which is subsequently leased by the Company to Braemar rent-free. In connection with Braemar's acquisition of The Ritz-Carlton Lake Tahoe on January 15, 2019, the Company is obligated to provide Braemar with approximately $10.3 million in exchange for FF&E at Braemar properties, subject to the terms of the Braemar ERFP Agreement.\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2018-07 expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from non-employees and aligns the guidance for share-based payments to non-employees with the requirements for share-based payments granted to employees. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We elected to early adopt the standard effective July 1, 2018, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nAudio visual revenue primarily consists of revenue generated within our J&S segment by providing event technology services such as audio visual services, audio visual equipment rental, staging and meeting services and event-related communication systems as well as related technical support, to our customers in various venues including hotels and convention centers. Revenue is recognized in the period in which services are provided pursuant to the terms of the contractual arrangements with our customers. We also evaluate whether it is appropriate to present (i) the gross amount that our customers pay for our services as revenue, and the related commissions paid to the venue as cost of revenue, or (ii) the net amount (gross revenue less the related commissions paid to the venue) as revenue. We are responsible for the delivery of the services, including providing the necessary labor and equipment to perform the services. We are generally subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers and, while in many cases the venue bills the end customer on our behalf, we bear the risk of collection from the customer. The venues' commissions are not dependent on collections. As a result, our revenue is primarily reported on a gross basis. Cost of revenues for audio visual principally includes commissions paid to venues, direct labor costs, the cost of equipment sub-rentals, depreciation of equipment, amortization of signing bonuses, as well as other costs such as supplies, freight, travel and other overhead from our venue and customer facing operations and any losses on equipment disposal.\nAlso on November 1, 2017, in connection with the acquisition of J&S, our J&S operating subsidiary entered into a $3.0 million equipment note and a $2.0 million draw term loan agreement. These loans each bear interest at LIBOR plus 3.25% and mature on November 1, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2018, $2.3 million was drawn on the equipment note and $2.0 million was outstanding on the draw term loan. All the loans in connection with the acquisition of J&S are partially secured by a security interest on all of the assets and equity interests of our J&S operating subsidiary.\nEquity-Based Compensation-Our equity incentive plan provides for the grant of restricted or unrestricted shares of our common stock, equity-based awards and other share awards, share appreciation rights, performance shares, performance units and other equity-based awards or any combination of the foregoing. Equity-based compensation included in salaries and benefits\u201d is accounted for at fair value based on the market price of the shares/options on the date of grant in accordance with applicable authoritative accounting guidance. The fair value is charged to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the shares/options. Grants of restricted stock to independent directors are recorded at fair value based on the market price of our shares at grant date, and this amount is fully expensed in general and administrative\u201d expense as the grants of stock are fully vested on the date of grant. Our officers and employees can be granted common stock and LTIP units from Ashford Trust and Braemar in connection with providing advisory services that result in expense, included in salaries and benefits,\u201d equal to the fair value of the award in proportion to the requisite service period satisfied during the period, as well as offsetting revenue in an equal amount included in advisory services\u201d revenue.\nDuring the third quarter of 2018, we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize a significant portion of our deferred tax assets because we recorded a $43.7 million deferred tax liability in the third quarter of 2018, and the future reversal of deferred tax liabilities is a source of future taxable income that allows us to utilize our deferred tax assets. Accordingly, in the third quarter of 2018, we reversed the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets by recording a $15.1 million deferred income tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations. The deferred tax liability related to our Premier acquisition, and it is the result of recording our book basis in Premier's acquired intangible assets at fair value while the tax basis of these assets was recorded using the seller's carryover basis, which is lower than fair value.\nOn November 8, 2018, OpenKey renewed the Loan and Security Agreement that expired in October 2018 for a revolving credit facility in the amount of $1.5 million. The credit facility is secured by all of OpenKey's assets and matures on April 30, 2020, with an interest rate of Prime Rate plus 2.75%. Creditors do not have recourse to Ashford Inc. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility. In connection with the 2018 renewal, OpenKey granted the creditors a 10-year warrant to purchase approximately 23,000 shares of OpenKey's preferred stock at $1.61 per share with an estimated fair value of $26,000. The fair value of the warrants was recorded in noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities and debt issuance costs, which is amortized over the term of the line of credit. Effective February 1, 2019, OpenKey had no borrowings outstanding and the $1.5 million revolving credit facility funds were no longer available.\nCost of Revenues for Project Management. Cost of revenues for project management was $3.3 million during 2018 compared to $0 for 2017, due to costs associated with project management revenues from the acquisition of Premier which occurred in August 2018.\nOn April 23, 2018, in connection with the name change by Braemar, the Company entered into the Fifth Amended and Restated Braemar Advisory Agreement, which amends the prior amended and restated advisory agreement only to reflect the name change and does not amend or otherwise alter the rights of any of the parties thereto.\n (1) The increase in expense is primarily due to increases in legal fees and transaction costs related to the acquisition of Premier, development and execution of our ERFP program and our investments in J&S and RED. \nOn January 22, 2019, Ashford Trust acquired The Embassy Suites New York Midtown Manhattan for a purchase price of $195.0 million. In connection with Ashford Trust's acquisition of the hotel, the Company is obligated to provide Ashford Trust with approximately $19.5 million in exchange for FF&E at Ashford Trust's hotel properties that will subsequently be leased back to Ashford Trust rent-free under the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement.\nStrategy Officer of the Company, appointed Mr. Jeremy J.

We own substantially all of our assets and conduct substantially all of our business through Ashford LLC, Premier, and Ashford Services.\nIn connection with the acquisition, on August 8, 2018, Ashford Inc. and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as Rights Agent, entered into a new Rights Agreement. Pursuant to the Rights Agreement, each Right initially entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series C Preferred Stock of the Company at a price of $275 per one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share represented by a Right, subject to adjustment (each as defined under the Rights Agreement). The Amended and Restated Rights Agreement of Ashford Inc. in effect prior to the acquisition of Premier is no longer in effect.\nWe are currently the advisor for Ashford Trust and Braemar. In our capacity as the advisor to Ashford Trust and Braemar, we are responsible for implementing the investment strategies and managing the day-to-day operations of Ashford Trust and Braemar, in each case subject to the supervision and oversight of the respective board of directors of Ashford Trust and Braemar. Ashford Trust commenced operating in August 2003 and is focused on investing in full service hotels in the upscale and upper-upscale segments in the U.S. that have RevPAR generally less than twice the national average. Braemar invests primarily in luxury hotels and resorts with RevPAR of at least twice the U.S. national average. Braemar became a publicly traded company in November 2013 upon the completion of its spin-off from Ashford Trust.

The Amendment is effective as of March 1, 2018, which is the date the Credit Facility became effective. Pursuant to the Amendment, the financial covenant of consolidated tangible net worth was replaced with the consolidated net worth, and Ashford Inc. is required to maintain consolidated net worth not less than 75% of the consolidated net worth as of December 31, 2017, plus 75% of the net equity proceeds of any future equity issuances by Ashford Inc.\nOn September 28, 2018, we completed a public offering of 270,000 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $74.50 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $20.1 million. The net proceeds from the sale of the shares after discounts and commissions to the underwriters and offering expenses were approximately $18.2 million. We also sold an additional 10,000 shares of common stock to the underwriters on October 10, 2018, in connection with the underwriters' partial exercise of their over-allotment option that had been granted to them in connection with the transaction. The net proceeds from the sale of the over-allotment shares after discounts and commissions to the underwriters were approximately $700,000.\nOn January 2, 2018, the Company issued 8,962 shares of common stock to the OpenKey redeemable noncontrolling interest holder in connection with the purchase of 519,647 shares of the outstanding Class B common stock in OpenKey, Inc.

For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. We determine the standalone selling prices based on our consolidated entities' overall pricing objectives taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the customer and the nature and value of the performance obligations within the applicable contracts.\nCost of Revenues for Audio Visual. Cost of revenues for audio visual expense was $7.8 million for 2017 compared to $0 for 2016 as a result of our acquisition of J&S. Cost of revenues for audio visual for 2017 includes depreciation expense related to audio visual rental pool equipment of $411,000.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract ( ASU 2018-15\u201d). ASU 2018-15 aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software as well as hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2018-15 will have on our consolidated financial statements.\n (2) The increase is primarily due to $2.5 million of expense related to the accelerated vesting of stock option awards upon the death of one of our executive officers, in accordance with the terms of the awards, partially offset by forfeitures. See notes 2, 15 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements. \n________\nOn August 7, 2018, at a Special Meeting of Stockholders, Ashford Inc. shareholders voted to approve certain matters related to Ashford Inc.'s acquisition of the project management business of Remington, including the issuance of 8,120,000 shares of Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock\u201d).\nThe Income Taxes\u201d topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification addresses the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements. The guidance requires us to determine whether tax positions we have taken or expect to take in a tax return are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority based on the technical merits of the positions. Tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not threshold would be recorded as additional tax expense in the current period. We analyze all open tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations for each jurisdiction, which includes the federal jurisdiction and various states. We classify interest and penalties related to underpayment of income taxes as income tax expense. We and our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states and cities, and, beginning November 1, 2017, in Mexico and the Dominican Republic. Tax years 2013 through 2017 remain subject to potential examination by certain federal and state taxing authorities.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments - a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force ( ASU 2016-15\u201d). The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. Certain issues addressed in this guidance include debt payments or debt extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, distributions received from equity method investments and beneficial interests in securitization transactions. We adopted this standard retrospectively effective January 1, 2018, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of cash flows and related disclosures for the year ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the adoption of ASU 2016-15 resulted in the bifurcation of the $2.6 million contingent consideration payment associated with the acquisition of J&S between financing and operating cash flows (included in payments due to affiliates\u201d) in the amounts of $1.2 million and $1.4 million, respectively, within our consolidated statements of cash flows. See notes 5 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOn December 5, 2017, the Board of Directors of Ashford Inc. approved a stock repurchase program (the Repurchase Program\u201d) pursuant to which the Board granted a repurchase authorization to acquire shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share having an aggregate value of up to $20 million. No shares were repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $6.8 million, or 269.7%, to $9.3 million for 2018 compared to 2017, primarily as a result of the amortization of the Premier and J&S definite-lived intangible assets, as well as FF&E additions related to software implementation and the November 2017 J&S acquisition. See note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. Depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, excludes depreciation expense related to audio visual rental pool equipment of $3.8 million and $411,000, respectively, which is\n (1) For variable-rate indebtedness, interest obligations are estimated based on the LIBOR and Prime interest rates as of December 31, 2018. We have assumed that credit facility balances remain outstanding until maturity using the interest rates as of December 31, 2018. \n\nSources and Uses of Cash\n (1) The increase in base advisory fee is due to higher revenue of $24,000 from Ashford Trust and higher revenue of $456,000 from Braemar. \n________\nthe timing of receipt of advisory fees from Ashford Trust and Braemar, timing of paying vendors and timing of operating subsidiaries' receipt of revenues.\nAshford Inc. is a Maryland corporation that provides asset management services, advisory services and other products and services primarily to clients in the hospitality industry. We became a public company in November 2014, when Ashford Trust completed the spin-off of Ashford Inc. through the distribution of approximately 70% of our outstanding common stock to Ashford Trust stockholders and unitholders in Ashford Trust's operating partnership, collectively. Our common stock is listed on the NYSE American. As of March 6, 2019, Ashford Trust held approximately 598,000 shares of our common stock which represented an approximate 24.2% ownership interest in Ashford Inc. and Braemar held approximately 195,000 shares, which represented an approximate 7.9% ownership interest in Ashford Inc.\nOther Income (Expense). Other expense was $73,000 and $162,000 in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nOn September 28, 2018, we completed a public offering of 270,000 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $74.50 per share for gross proceeds of $20.1 million. The net proceeds from the sale of the shares after discounts and commissions to the underwriters and offering expenses were approximately $18.2 million. We also sold an additional 10,000 shares of common stock to the underwriters on October 10, 2018, in connection with the underwriters' partial exercise of their over-allotment option that had been granted to them in connection with the transaction. The net proceeds from the sale of the over-allotment shares after discounts and commissions to the underwriters were approximately $700,000.\n (2) The decrease in incentive advisory fee is due to lower revenue of $596,000 from Braemar. The incentive advisory fee for 2018 includes the first year installment of the Braemar 2018 incentive advisory fee in the amount of $678,000 and the third year installment of the Ashford Trust 2016 incentive advisory fee in the amount of $1.8 million for which payment is due January 2019. The incentive advisory fee for 2017 includes the second year installment of the Ashford Trust 2016 incentive advisory fee in the amount of $1.8 million, which was paid in January 2018, as well as the third year installment of the Braemar 2015 incentive advisory fee in the amount of $1.3 million, which was also paid in January 2018. Incentive fee payments are subject to meeting the December 31 FCCR Condition each year, as defined in our advisory agreements. Ashford Trust's annual total stockholder return did not meet the relevant incentive fee thresholds during the 2018, 2017 and 2015 measurement periods. Braemar's annual total stockholder return did not meet the relevant incentive fee thresholds during the 2017 and 2016 measurement periods. \n (1) The increase in base advisory fee is due to higher revenue of $758,000 from Ashford Trust and higher revenue of $624,000 from Braemar. \nOn April 6, 2017, Pure Wellness entered into a term loan of $375,000 and a line of credit of $100,000 for which the creditor does not have recourse to Ashford Inc. The term loan has a fixed interest rate of 5.00% per annum. On October 1, 2018, we paid off the remaining balance on the term loan. The line of credit has a variable interest rate of Prime Rate plus 1.00%. There is no stated maturity date related to the line of credit as it is payable on demand; accordingly, the balance has been classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheets.\nOn March 23, 2018, our RED operating subsidiary entered into a term loan of $750,000 and a revolving credit facility of $250,000 for which the creditor has recourse to Ashford Inc. Approximately $225,000 of the proceeds from the term loan are held in an escrow account, which is included in our consolidated balance sheet within other assets\u201d as of December 31, 2018. The term loan bears interest at the Prime Rate plus 1.75% and matures on April 5, 2025. The revolving credit facility bears interest at the Prime Rate plus 1.75% and matures on March 5, 2019.\nOn January 16, 2018, the Company closed on the acquisition of a passenger vessel and other assets related to RED Hospitality & Leisure LLC (\"RED\"), a provider of watersports activities and other travel and transportation services. The Company paid $970,000 cash, comprised of a $750,000 deposit paid on December 11, 2017, which was reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as other assets\u201d as of December 31, 2017, and an additional $220,000 paid on January 16, 2018. This transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition recorded at cost, and did not result in the recognition of goodwill. During 2018, our RED operating subsidiary acquired additional passenger vessels for $2.4 million, a ferry for $2.5 million and paid a $400,000 deposit for a new passenger vessel. The Company owns an 80% interest in RED.\nOn March 1, 2019, J&S, our consolidated subsidiary, acquired a privately-held company that conducts the business of BAV Services in the United States ( BAV\u201d) for approximately $9.0 million. BAV is an audio visual rental, staging, and production company, focused on meeting and special event services. As a result of the acquisition, our ownership interest in J&S, which we consolidate under the voting interest model, increased from 85% to approximately 88%. The purchase price consisted of (i) $5.0 million in cash, funded by an existing term loan; (ii) $4.0 million in the form of Ashford Inc. common stock, consisting of 61,387 shares issued on March 1, 2019, which was determined based on an agreed upon value of $3.5 million using a thirty-day weighted average price per share of $57.01 and had an estimated fair value of $3.9 million on the acquisition date, and additional shares with an estimated fair value of $500,000 to be issued 18 months from the acquisition date, subject to certain conditions; and (iii) contingent consideration up to $3.0 million, payable, if earned, 12 to 18 months from the acquisition date. The results of operations of BAV will be included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition beginning in the first quarter of 2019. We are in the process of evaluating the fair value of the net assets acquired through internal studies and third-party valuations and expect to complete a preliminary purchase price allocation in the first quarter of 2019.\nRealized Gain (Loss) on Investments. Realized loss on investments was $0 for 2018 and $294,000 in 2017. The realized loss on investments is related to options on futures contracts and investments held by the AQUA U.S. Fund which was fully dissolved during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSalaries and Benefits Expense. Salaries and benefits expense increased $18.0 million, or 29.4%, to $79.2 million for 2018 compared to 2017. The change in salaries and benefits expense consisted of the following (in thousands):\nWe provide the personnel and services that we believe are necessary to assist each of Ashford Trust and Braemar in conducting their respective businesses. We may also perform similar functions for new or additional platforms. We are not responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the individual hotel properties owned by either Ashford Trust or Braemar, which duties are, and will continue to be, the responsibility of the hotel management companies that operate the hotel properties owned by Ashford Trust and Braemar.\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $51.5 million and $36.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, respectively, and $7.9 million and $9.1 million of restricted cash, respectively.\nTotal Revenue. Total revenue increased $14.0 million, or 20.7% to $81.6 million in 2017.

BAV is an audio visual rental, staging, and production company, focused on meeting and special event services. As a result of the acquisition, our ownership interest in J&S, which we consolidate under the voting interest model, increased from 85% to approximately 88%. The purchase price consisted of (i) $5.0 million in cash, funded by an existing term loan; (ii) $4.0 million in the form of Ashford Inc. common stock, consisting of 61,387 shares issued on March 1, 2019, which was determined based on an agreed upon value of $3.5 million using a thirty-day weighted average price per share of $57.01 and had an estimated fair value of $3.9 million on the acquisition date, and additional shares with an estimated fair value of $500,000 to be issued 18 months from the acquisition date, subject to certain conditions; and (iii) contingent consideration up to $3.0 million, payable, if earned, 12 to 18 months from the acquisition date.

Dividend income was $93,000 and $170,000 for 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to investments held by the AQUA U.S. Fund.\n_______\nEffective January 1, 2019, we acquired a 30% noncontrolling ownership interest in Real Estate Advisory Holdings LLC (\"REA Holdings\"), a real estate advisory firm that provides financing, advisory and property sales services primarily to clients in the hospitality and leisure industry, for a purchase price of approximately $3.0 million which was paid in the form of $2.1 million cash and the issuance of 16,529 shares of our common stock (approximately $890,000) to the seller pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements under the Securities Act, provided under Section 4(a)(2) thereunder. We have an option to acquire an additional 50% of the ownership interests in REA Holdings for $12.5 million beginning on January 1, 2022. Our investment in REA Holdings is accounted for under the equity method as we have significant influence over the voting interest entity.\nRevenue Recognition. Advisory services revenue is reported within our REIT Advisory segment and primarily consists of advisory fees and expense reimbursements that are recognized when services have been rendered. Advisory fees consist of base fees and incentive fees. For Ashford Trust, the base fee was paid quarterly and ranges from 0.50% to 0.70% per annum of the total market capitalization ranging from less than $6.0 billion to greater than $10.0 billion plus, prior to June 26, 2018, the Key Money Asset Management Fee, as defined in the amended and restated advisory agreement, subject to certain minimums. Upon effectiveness of the Enhanced Return Funding Program Agreement and Amendment No. 1 to the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement on June 29, 2018, the base fee is paid monthly and ranges from 0.50% to 0.70% per annum of the total market capitalization ranging from less than $6.0 billion to greater than $10.0 billion plus the Net Asset Fee Adjustment, as defined in the amended and restated advisory agreement, as amended, subject to certain minimums.

The payment is included in deferred income\u201d on our consolidated balance sheet and is being recognized over the initial ten-year term of the agreement. \nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. This MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included in Item 8. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our results and the timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOther. Other operating expense was $3.3 million and $2.2 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively. Other operating expense includes cost of goods sold and royalties associated with OpenKey, Pure Wellness and RED as well as expense from the increase in fair value of contingent consideration related to the J&S acquisition. See note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.\n (1) The change in cash salaries and benefits expense is primarily due to fluctuations in the number of employees, salary and bonus awards, group insurance costs, payroll taxes and employee participation in the benefits offered. Cash salaries and benefits recorded in 2018 included $1.3 million of severance costs and $716,000 of additional bonus expense recorded upon receiving approval from the board of directors in the first quarter of 2018. The acquisition of J&S in November 2017 contributed $5.8 million to the increase over 2017. \nOn January 15, 2019, the Company entered into the Braemar ERFP agreement with Braemar. Under the Braemar ERFP Agreement, the Company agreed to provide $50 million to Braemar in connection with Braemar's acquisition of hotels recommended by us, with the option to increase the funding commitment to up to $100 million upon mutual agreement by the parties. Under the Braemar ERFP Agreement, the Company is obligated to provide Braemar 10% of the acquired hotel's purchase price in exchange for FF&E at Braemar properties, which is subsequently leased by the Company to Braemar rent-free. In connection with Braemar's acquisition of The Ritz-Carlton Lake Tahoe on January 15, 2019, the Company is obligated to provide Braemar with approximately $10.3 million in exchange for FF&E at Braemar properties, subject to the terms of the Braemar ERFP Agreement.\n (2) The increase in expense is primarily due to our investments in Premier, J&S and RED.  Impairment. Impairment of capitalized software implementation costs was $1.9 million during 2018 compared to $1.1 million for 2017. See notes 2 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements.\n (1) The increase in these costs is primarily due to investments in Pure Wellness, OpenKey and J&S. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in legal expense. \nOn March 1, 2018, the Company and its subsidiary Ashford Hospitality Holdings LLC entered into a $35 million senior revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. The credit facility provides for a three-year revolving line of credit and bears interest at the Base Rate plus 2.00% to 2.50% or LIBOR plus 3.00% to 3.50%, depending on the leverage level of the Company. There is a one-year extension option subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The new credit facility includes the opportunity to expand the borrowing capacity by up to $40 million to an aggregate amount of $75 million, subject to certain conditions. At December 31, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement ( ASU 2018-13\u201d). ASU 2018-13 modifies certain disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements including requiring disclosures on changes in unrealized gains and losses in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements and a requirement to disclose the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2018-13 will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nCertain segments of our business are capital intensive and may require additional financing from time to time. Any additional financings, if and when pursued, may not be available on favorable terms or at all, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and capital resources.\nOn March 21, 2018, Ashford Inc. entered into the First Amendment (the Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement dated March 1, 2018 (the Credit Facility\u201d), with Ashford Hospitality Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of Ashford Inc., Bank of America,\n (9) In connection with our key money transaction with our managed REITs, we lease furniture, fixtures and equipment to Ashford Trust and Braemar at no cost. A portion of the base advisory fee is allocated to lease revenue each period equal to the estimated fair value of the lease payments that would have been made. \nOn March 23, 2018, our RED operating subsidiary entered into a term loan of $750,000 and a revolving credit facility of $250,000 for which the creditor has recourse to Ashford Inc. Approximately $225,000 of the proceeds from the term loan are held in an escrow account, which is included in our consolidated balance sheet within other assets\u201d as of December 31, 2018.

The revolving credit facility provides RED with available borrowings up to a total of $250,000, bears interest at the Prime Rate plus 1.75% and matures on February 5, 2020.\nOn August 8, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Premier, the project management business formerly conducted by certain affiliates of Remington, for a total transaction value of $203 million. As a result, the project management services that were previously provided by Remington Lodging & Hospitality, LLC, ( Remington Lodging\u201d) are now provided by a subsidiary of Ashford Inc. under the respective project management agreement with each customer, including Ashford Trust and Braemar. The purchase price was paid by issuing 8,120,000 shares of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to the sellers of Premier (the Remington Sellers\u201d), primarily MJB Investments, LP (which is wholly-owned by Monty J. Bennett, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our board of directors), and his father Archie Bennett, Jr., the Chairman Emeritus of Ashford Trust (together, the Bennetts\u201d). The Series B Convertible Preferred Stock has a conversion price of $140 per share and would convert into 1,450,000 shares of our common stock. Dividends on the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock are payable at an annual rate of 5.5% in the first year, 6.0% in the second year, and 6.5% in the third year and each year thereafter. In addition to certain separate class voting rights, the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock vote on an as-converted basis with the holders of the common stock on all matters submitted for approval by the holders of our capital stock possessing general voting rights. However, for five years following the closing of the acquisition of Premier, the Remington Sellers and their transferees are subject to certain voting restrictions with respect to shares in excess of 25% of the combined voting power of the Company's outstanding capital stock. The holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock have certain conversion rights upon certain events constituting a change of control of the Company.\n (8) The decrease in investment management reimbursements is due to lower revenue of $820,000 from Ashford Trust. Investment management reimbursements include AIM's management of Ashford Trust's excess cash under the Investment Management Agreement executed in 2017. AIM is not compensated for its services but is reimbursed for all costs and expenses. \nIn addition to the amounts discussed above, as of December 31, 2018, we also have approximately $33.9 million of purchase commitments related to our Enhanced Return Funding Program with Ashford Trust which are contingent upon Ashford Trust acquiring additional hotels. See notes 11 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements.\n (11) The increase in other services revenue is due to higher revenue of $971,000 from Ashford Trust, higher revenue of $816,000 from Braemar and higher revenue of $1.6 million from third parties. Other services revenue relates to other hotel products and services provided by our consolidated subsidiaries, OpenKey, Pure Wellness and RED, to Ashford Trust, Braemar and third parties. \n(Income) Loss from Consolidated Entities Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests. The noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities were allocated a loss of $924,000 in 2018 and a loss of $358,000 in 2017. See notes 2, 13, and 17 to our consolidated financial statements for more details regarding ownership interests, carrying values and allocations.\nOn June 1, 2018, the board of directors of the Company appointed Mr. Robert G. Haiman as Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company, effective June 1, 2018.\nOn April 4, 2018, the Board of Directors of Ashford Inc. approved the updated form of Amended and Restated Indemnification Agreement to be entered into by the Company and each of its directors and officers.\nInterest Income. Interest income was $244,000 and $73,000 for 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n (12) See note 19 for discussion of segment reporting.  Salaries and Benefits Expense. Salaries and benefits expense increased $8.8 million, or 16.8%, to $61.2 million in 2017 compared to 2016. The change in salaries and benefits expense consisted of the following (in thousands):\nOn October 31, 2018, Ashford Trust acquired the La Posada de Santa Fe ( La Posada\u201d) in Santa Fe, New Mexico, for a purchase price of $50 million. In connection with Ashford Trust's acquisition of the hotel, the Company was obligated to provide Ashford Trust with approximately $5.0 million in exchange for FF&E for use at Ashford Trust properties, in each case subject to the terms of the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had paid Ashford Trust $5.0 million of cash in exchange for FF&E that was subsequently leased back to Ashford Trust rent-free under the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nInterest Income. Interest income was $329,000 and $244,000 for 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nNet Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash flows provided by financing activities were $20.5 million due to $18.9 million of net cash proceeds from the issuance of our common stock, $2.7 million of contributions from noncontrolling interests in a consolidated entity, $6.6 million of proceeds from borrowings on notes payable and $1.0 million of net borrowings on our revolving credit facilities. These were offset by $4.5 million of dividends paid on our preferred stock, $2.0 million of payments on notes payable and capital leases, $1.2 million of contingent consideration related to the November 2017 acquisition of J&S, $638,000 of loan cost payments, $314,000 in distributions to non-controlling interests and net repayments in advances to employees of $82,000 associated with tax withholdings for restricted stock vesting.\nAcquisitions-We account for acquisitions and investments in businesses as business combinations if the target meets the definition of a business and (a) the target is a VIE and we are the target's primary beneficiary, and therefore we must consolidate its financial statements, or (b) we acquire more than 50% of the voting interest of the target and it was not previously consolidated. We record business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The application of the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. The fair value assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash flows used in financing activities was $42.1 million, which consisted of $44.1 million of distributions to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities, utilization of excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation of $284,000, net repayments in advances to employees of $41,000 associated with tax withholdings for restricted stock vestings, $20,000 for the purchase of treasury shares associated with tax withholdings for restricted stock vestings, and $18,000 for cash redemptions of units, partially offset by $2.4 million of contributions from noncontrolling interests in a consolidated entity.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses increased $17.4 million, or 100.4%, to $34.8 million for 2018 compared to 2017. The change in general and administrative expense consisted of the following (in thousands):\n\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders. Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders changed $23.3 million, or 127.2%, to $5.0 million of net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 ( 2018\u201d) compared to the $18.4 million of net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 ( 2017\u201d) as a result of the factors discussed below.\n (5) The DCP obligation is recorded as a liability at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in earnings. The gain in 2018 and the loss in 2017 are primarily attributable to decreases and increases, respectively, in the fair value of the DCP obligation. See note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.  Cost of Revenues for Audio Visual. Cost of revenues for audio visual was $64.6 million during 2018 compared to $7.8 million for 2017, due to new costs associated with new audio visual revenues from the acquisition of J&S which occurred in November 2017.\n\nIncome Tax (Expense) Benefit. Income tax expense decreased by $20.1 million, from $9.7 million expense in 2017 to $10.4 million benefit in 2018. Current tax expense decreased by $1.9 million, from $3.8 million in 2017 to $1.9 million in 2018, due to lower taxable income which was primarily the result of deductions for bonus depreciation. Deferred tax benefit increased by $18.2 million from $6.0 million expense in 2017 to $12.2 million benefit in 2018. The 2017 period expense was related primarily to the April 2017 legal entity restructuring of the Company, and 2018 benefit was related primarily to the acquisition of Premier, which resulted in the reversal of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in the third quarter of 2018.\n_______\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards-In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, also referred to as ASC 606\u201d Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity shall recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. An entity is required to (a) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (b) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (c) determine the transaction price, (d) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (e) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. In determining the transaction price, an entity may include variable consideration only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized would not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. ASC 606 also specifies the accounting for certain costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer. In addition, the new guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to the Company. Net loss attributable to the Company increased $16.0 million, or 665.9%, to $18.4 million for 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 ( 2016\u201d) as a result of the factors discussed below.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards-In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases ( ASU 2016-02\u201d). The new standard establishes a right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) model that requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases ( ASU 2018-10\u201d) and ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842), Targeted Improvements ( ASU 2018-11\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2018-10 affect only narrow aspects of the guidance issued in the amendments in ASU 2016-02, including but not limited to lease residual value guarantee, rate implicit in the lease, lease term and purchase option. The amendments in ASU 2018-11 provide an optional transition method for adoption of the new standard, which will allow entities to continue to apply the legacy guidance in ASC 840, including its disclosure requirements, in the comparative periods presented in the year of adoption. In December 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-20, Leases (Topic 842), Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors ( ASU 2018-20\u201d). The amendments create a lessor practical expedient applicable to sales and other similar taxes incurred in connection with a lease, and simplify lessor accounting for lessor costs paid by the lessee. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, which will require us to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of 2019 on a modified retrospective basis with an option to use the transition relief provided in ASU 2018-11. The accounting for leases under which we are the lessor remains largely unchanged. While we continue evaluating our lease portfolio to assess the impact that ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements, we expect the primary impact to our consolidated financial statements upon adoption will be the recognition, on a discounted basis, of our future minimum rentals due under noncancellable leases on our consolidated balance sheet resulting in the recording of ROU assets and lease obligations estimated to be between $23.6 million and $28.8 million. Upon adoption, we will not recognize lease revenue for our rent-free leases of FF&E commencing on or after the adoption date under our ERFP agreements with our related parties Ashford Trust and Braemar. We expect to elect the package of practical expedients in transition that permits entities not to reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, to retain the lease classification and to continue to capitalize initial direct costs for any leases that exist prior to adoption of the standard. We expect to use the transition method in ASU 2018-11 that allows us to adopt the new lease standard effective January 1, 2019, and not reevaluate or recast prior periods. However, we are still evaluating the available transition methods. We are implementing repeatable processes to manage ongoing lease data collection and analysis, and evaluating accounting policies and internal controls that will be impacted by the new standards.\nNet (Income) Loss Attributable to Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests. Net losses of $1.5 million and $1.1 million were allocated to redeemable noncontrolling interests in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Redeemable noncontrolling interests represented ownership interests in Ashford Holdings and certain of our consolidated subsidiaries. Prior to April 6, 2017, the noncontrolling interests represented ownership interests in Ashford LLC. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of ownership interests, carrying values and allocations, see notes 2, 14, and 17 to our consolidated financial statements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $23.2 million, which was attributable to the acquisition of a controlling interest in J&S for $19.0 million (net of cash acquired of approximately $200,000), purchases of computer software and FF&E of $3.6 million, a $750,000 deposit for certain assets related to RED, partially offset by proceeds from the disposal of FF&E of $15,000 and $129,000 of cash acquired in the acquisition of Pure Wellness.\nOn August 31, 2018, our RED operating subsidiary entered into a term loan of $1.8 million for which the creditor has recourse to Ashford Inc. The term loan bears interest at the Prime Rate plus 2.00% and matures on February 1, 2029.\nOur long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for operating expenses attributable to paying our employees, investments to grow our business, and our ERFP and certain recent subsidiary financing transactions noted below. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, including net cash provided by operations, future equity issuances and availability under our revolving credit facilities.\n (10) The increase in other services revenue is due to higher revenue of $993,000 from Ashford Trust, higher revenue of $41,000 from Braemar and higher revenue of $1.3 million from third parties. Other services revenue is associated with the provision of other hotel products and services by our consolidated subsidiaries, Pure Wellness and OpenKey, to Ashford Trust, Braemar and third parties. \nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $959,000 and $83,000 for 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to the notes payable, lines of credit and capital leases held by our consolidated subsidiaries. See notes 2 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements.\n (5) The DCP obligation is recorded as a liability in accordance with the applicable authoritative accounting guidance. The DCP obligation is carried at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in earnings. The 2017 loss is primarily attributable to an increase in the fair value of the DCP obligation whereas the fair value of the DCP obligation decreased in 2016. See note 16 to our consolidated financial statements. \n (14) See note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of segment reporting. \nDividend Income. Dividend income was $0 and $93,000 for 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to investments held by the AQUA U.S. Fund which was fully dissolved during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASU 2016-01\u201d), which requires an entity to: (i) measure equity investments at fair value through net income, with certain exceptions; (ii) present in OCI the changes in instrument-specific credit risk for financial liabilities measured using the fair value option; (iii) present financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset; (iv) calculate the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes based on an exit price; and (v) assess a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to unrealized losses of AFS debt securities in combination with other deferred tax assets. ASU 2016-01 provides an election to subsequently measure certain nonmarketable equity investments at cost less any impairment and adjusted for certain observable price changes. It also requires a qualitative impairment assessment of such equity investments and amends certain fair value disclosure requirements. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017,", "item_7_tables": "Table 115: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>
