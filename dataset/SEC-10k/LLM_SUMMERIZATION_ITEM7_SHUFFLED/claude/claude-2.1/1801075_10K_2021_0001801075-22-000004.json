MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis MD&A should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. For comparison of 2020 to 2019, see Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 4, 2021.\nIntroductory Note Regarding Pending Merger\nOn August 6, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) with Brookfield Asset Management Reinsurance Partners Ltd. ( Brookfield Reinsurance\u201d), an exempted company limited by shares existing under the laws of Bermuda, and Freestone Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Brookfield Reinsurance ( Merger Sub\u201d). Upon completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Company will become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Brookfield Reinsurance in consideration for the payment of $190.00 per share in cash, for total merger consideration of $5.1 billion.\nRegulatory Approval Process. The completion of the Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the Merger\u201d) is subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions, including obtaining the required regulatory approval from the insurance authorities in Texas, Missouri, New York, Louisiana and California. The required insurance regulatory process has been moving forward consistent with our prior disclosures, and we continue to expect to complete the Merger before the end of the first half of 2022. However, because state insurance regulatory approval remains outstanding, the Company cannot provide assurance the Merger will be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all.\nMerger Agreement's Restrictions on Interim Operations. The Company has agreed to certain covenants in the Merger Agreement restricting the conduct of its business between the date of the Merger Agreement and the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of the Merger Agreement. The general effect of these covenants is that, during such interim period, the Company will be limited in its ability to pursue strategic and operational matters outside the ordinary course of business. The Company has agreed that it and its subsidiaries will conduct their business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice in all material respects and use reasonable best efforts to preserve their business organizations, goodwill and assets, keep available the services of their current key officers and employees, and preserve their present relationships with governmental entities and other key third parties, including customers, reinsurers, distributors, suppliers and other persons with whom the Company and its subsidiaries have business relationships.\nIn addition, the Company has agreed to specific restrictions relating to the conduct of its business between the date of the Merger Agreement and the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, not to take (or permit any of its subsidiaries to take) the following actions (subject, in each case, to exceptions specified below and in the Merger Agreement or previously disclosed in writing to Brookfield Reinsurance as provided in the Merger Agreement or as consented to in writing in advance by Brookfield Reinsurance (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) or as required by law:\n\u2022subject to certain limited exceptions, offer, issue, sell, transfer, pledge, dispose of or encumber any shares of, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, or options, warrants, calls, commitments or rights of any kind to acquire, any shares of capital stock or other voting or equity interests of any class or series of the Company or its subsidiaries;\n\u2022amend or propose to amend the Company's or its subsidiaries' certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other comparable organizational documents, in each case, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise;\n\u2022authorize, recommend, propose, enter into or adopt a plan or agreement of complete or partial liquidation, dissolution, merger, consolidation, restructuring, recapitalization or other reorganization of the Company or any of its subsidiaries;\n\u2022subject to certain limited exceptions (including permitting the Company to execute investment portfolio transactions in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and in accordance with its existing investment plan and investment guidelines), acquire or agree to acquire any business or any corporation, partnership, association or other business organization or division thereof;\n\u2022make or authorize capital expenditures that are, on an individual basis, in excess of\u2009110% of the Company's capital expenditure budget or in excess of 105% of the aggregate capital expenditure budget, except for (i) planned capital expenditures disclosed to Brookfield Reinsurance at signing of the Merger Agreement and (ii) reasonable emergency capital expenditures (after consultation with Brookfield Reinsurance) necessary to maintain its ability to operate its businesses in the ordinary course or for the safety of individuals, assets or the environment;\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\n\u2022subject to certain limited exceptions, sell, lease, license, transfer, pledge, subject to any encumbrance or otherwise dispose of any of its or their assets or properties;\n\u2022incur, guarantee or assume any indebtedness, subject to certain limited exceptions, including investment portfolio transactions in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and other incurrences of indebtedness not to exceed $10,000,000 in the aggregate;\n\u2022enter into any material contract or reinsurance contract other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice; and\n\u2022terminate, amend, modify, assign or waive any material right under any material contract or reinsurance contract except in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.\nThe Merger Agreement permits the Company to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends not to exceed $0.82 per share of common stock prior to completion of the Merger.\nThe above is a summary of certain material terms of the Merger Agreement and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which was filed as an exhibit to the Company's current report on Form 8-K filed on August 9, 2021.\nCaution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements made in this report, including but not limited to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto appearing in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data herein, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Item 7 (\"MD&A\"), and the exhibits and financial statement schedules filed as a part hereof or incorporated by reference herein, may contain or incorporate by reference information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

A summary of significant actions the Company took in response to COVID-19 through December 31, 2020 is disclosed in our 2020 Annual Report on form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 4, 2021. Below is a summary of significant subsequent developments in our COVID-19 response:\n\u2022We continue to take steps to protect employees with the goals of maintaining their health and sustaining an adequate workforce, including employees working from home and offering flexibility for employees negotiating scheduling conflicts due to the impacts of COVID-19, such as caring for family, alternative arrangements and shutdowns for business and schools, self-isolation or personal illness, including granting additional paid time off for vaccinations and to address these hardships.\n\u2022We suspended our summer Internship Program for 2020, and in 2021 piloted a program which combined both virtual and in-person elements for a small group of interns. In 2022, we will be offering a hybrid program with virtual and in-person elements, to an expanded group of interns.\n\u2022We have developed and are continually refining our return-to-office plans for our locations. Beginning in June 2021, we gradually re-introduced more employees to our office locations but had to lessen our in-office presence in the latter part of the year due to a surge in the Omicron variant. We are continually monitoring the situation with a longer-term plan to offer employees hybrid work schedules, where possible.\nAlthough we have been able to maintain our business operations since the onset of the pandemic, no assurance can be given that these actions will continue to be successful, nor can we predict the level of disruption that will occur should the COVID-19 pandemic and its related macroeconomic risks continue for further extended periods of time. Given this uncertainty, we are unable to quantify with reasonable confidence the total expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our future operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. The wide-ranging social, economic and financial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and the possible effects of ongoing and future governmental action in response to COVID-19 compound this uncertainty. Additional information regarding risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic are set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. For additional information regarding the direct and indirect impact to mortality refer to Part II, Item 7, MD&A, Life.\nThis MD&A should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nOverview\nAmerican National Group, Inc. (\"ANAT\") is a family of companies that has $31.3 billion in assets, $24.3 billion in liabilities and $7.0 billion in stockholders' equity as of December 31, 2021. American National Insurance Company (\"ANICO\"), founded in 1905 and headquartered in Galveston, Texas, and other ANAT subsidiaries offer a broad spectrum of products and services, which include life insurance, annuities, property and casualty insurance, health insurance, credit insurance, and pension products. The American National companies operate in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. In addition to ANICO, major subsidiaries include American National Life Insurance Company of Texas, American National Life Insurance Company of New York, American National Property and Casualty Company, Garden State Life Insurance Company, Standard Life and Accident Insurance Company, Farm Family Casualty Insurance Company and United Farm Family Insurance Company.\nOur business has been and will continue to be influenced by several industry-wide, segment or product-specific trends and conditions. In our discussion below, we first outline the broad macro-economic or industry trends (General Trends) that we expect to impact our overall business. Second, we discuss certain segment-specific trends we believe may impact individual segments or specific products within these segments.\nGeneral Trends\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations are materially affected by economic and financial market conditions. The U.S. and global economies, as well as the capital markets, continue to show mixed signals, and uncertainties continue to be significant factors in the markets in which we operate. Factors such as consumer spending, business investment, the volatility of the capital markets, the level of interest rates, unemployment, the level of participation in the workforce and the risk of inflation or deflation will affect the business and economic environment and, in turn, impact the demand for the type of financial and insurance products we offer. Adverse changes in the economy could have a material adverse effect on us. However, we believe those risks are somewhat mitigated by our financial strength, active enterprise risk management and disciplined underwriting for our products. Our diverse product mix and distribution channels across insurance segments is a strength that we expect will help us adapt to the volatile economic environment and give us the ability to serve the changing needs of our customers. Additionally, through our long-term business approach, we believe we are financially strong, and we are committed to providing a steady and reliable source of financial protection for policyholders.\nInterest Rates: The low-interest rate environment is a challenge for life and annuity insurers as the spreads on deposit-type contracts remain narrow, especially as interest rates have approached minimum crediting rates. Low market interest rates reduce the spreads between the amounts we credit to fixed annuity and individual life policyholders and the amounts we earn on the investments that support these obligations. Our ALM Committee actively manages the profitability of these blocks of business. In previous years, we reduced the guaranteed minimum crediting rates on new fixed annuity contracts, which has afforded us the flexibility to respond to the unusually low-interest rate environment. We have also reduced crediting rates on in-force contracts, where permitted to do so. These actions help mitigate the adverse impact of low interest rates on the profitability of these products, although sales volume may be negatively impacted as a result. We also maintain assets with various maturities to support product liabilities and ensure liquidity. A gradual increase in longer-term interest rates relative to short-term rates generally will have a favorable effect on the profitability of our products. Rapidly rising interest rates could result in reduced persistency of our spread-based products, if contract holders shift assets into higher yielding investments. We believe our ability to react quickly to the changing marketplace will help us manage this risk.\nThe interest rate environment affects estimated future profit projections, which could impact the amortization of our DAC assets and the estimates of policyholder liabilities. Significantly lower future estimated profits may cause us to accelerate the amortization of DAC or require us to establish additional policyholder liabilities, thereby reducing earnings. We periodically review assumptions with respect to future earnings to ensure they remain appropriate considering the current interest rate environment.\nLow interest rates are also challenging for property and casualty insurers. Investment income is an important element in earning an acceptable return on capital. Lower interest rates resulting in lower investment income require us to achieve better underwriting results. We have adjusted policy prices to help mitigate the adverse impact of low interest rates on our property and casualty business.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nChanging Regulatory Environment: The insurance industry is primarily regulated at the state level, although some life and annuity products and services are also subject to U.S. federal regulation. We are regularly subjected to additional or changing regulation that requires us to update systems, change product structure, increase the amount of reporting or adopt changes to distribution. These changes may increase the capital requirements for us and the industry, increase operating costs, change our operating practices and change our ability to provide products with pricing attractive to the marketplace.\nImportance of Operating Efficiencies: The volatile economic environment and costs associated with greater regulation create a further need for operating efficiencies. We manage our cost base while maintaining our commitment to provide superior customer service to policyholders and agents. Investments in technology are coordinated through a disciplined project management process. We anticipate continuous improvement in our use of technology to enhance our policyholders' and agents' experience and increase our overall operating effectiveness.\nIncreased Role of Advanced Technology: The use of mobile technology has changed the way consumers want to conduct their business, including real-time access to information. Many customers expect to complete transactions in a digital format instead of traditional methods that require a phone call or submission of paper forms. Social media and other customer-facing technologies also reshape the way companies communicate and collaborate with key stakeholders, and new tools exist to better collect and analyze information for potential business opportunities and better management of risks. For example, we have mobile-enabled all internet-based access and leveraged social media channels to reach out to potential customers to promote awareness of the company, including the products and services offered. We expect that technology will continue to evolve, offering new and more effective ways to reach and service our customers and shareholders. We evaluate available and evolving technologies and incorporate those we believe offer appropriate benefits to the company and its customers.\nContinued Challenges of Talent Attraction and Retention: Attracting qualified individuals and retaining existing employees continues to be a challenge for employers. Businesses have become extremely competitive in the ever-changing landscape of the talent marketplace. As a result, it is an increasing challenge to distinguish us as an employer of choice.\nTo address these challenges, we continue to seek out new and expanded uses for technology and social media that enhance our employer brand and educate candidates on the many benefits of working for us. Our planning and outreach efforts to develop a more diverse and inclusive workplace continue and help to strengthen the engagement of current employees as well as attract future employees. We continue to amplify the voice of our employees with regular surveys which help us grow and innovate. We actively value the perspectives that each employee brings and encourage broader employee influence on how decisions are made. As a result, we continue to experience increase in overall employee engagement. Providing robust career development conversations and career paths, personal growth opportunities and effective succession planning are also important elements of our retention and employee development efforts.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has devoted key resources to make employee health and safety a top priority. These efforts are having a positive impact as reflected in recent employee engagement survey results. Additionally, as we speak with candidates during the talent acquisition process, our precautions and protocols to ensure employee safety have been important to them when making the decision to join us. As we proceed though the pandemic, employee safety, productivity and retention are vital to meeting business goals and objectives.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nLife and Annuity\nEffective management of invested assets and associated liabilities using crediting rates and, where applicable, financial hedging instruments (which we use as economic hedges of equity-indexed life and annuity products), is important to the success of our Life and Annuity segments. Asset disintermediation,\u201d the risk of large outflows of cash at times when it is disadvantageous to us to dispose of invested assets, is a risk associated with these segments as are rates of mortality and surrenders that exceed our assumptions.\nDemographics: We believe a key driver shaping the actions of the life insurance industry is the rising income protection, wealth accumulation and insurance needs of an increasing number of retirees. As a result of increasing longevity and uncertainty regarding the Social Security System and an ongoing transition from defined benefit pension plans to 401(k) type retirement plans, retirees will need to accumulate sufficient savings to support retirement income requirements.\nWe believe we are well positioned to address the increasing need for savings tools and income protection. We believe our overall financial strength and broad distribution channels position us to respond with a variety of products for individuals approaching retirement age, who seek information to plan for and manage their retirement needs. We believe our products that offer guaranteed income flows are well suited to serve this market.\nCompetitive Pressures: In recent years, the competitive landscape of the U.S. life insurance industry has shifted. Established insurers are competing against each other and also against new market entrants that are developing products to attract the interest of the growing number of retirees. Competition exists in terms of retaining and acquiring consumers' business and also in terms of access to producers and distributors. Consolidation among distributors coupled with the aging sales force remains a challenge among insurers. In addition, the increased technological sophistication of consumers necessitates that insurers and distributors invest significant resources in technology to adapt to consumer expectations. We believe we possess sufficient scale, financial strength, resources and flexibility to compete effectively.\nWe believe we will continue to be competitive in the life and annuity markets through our broad line of products, diverse distribution channels, and consistent high level of customer service. We modify our products to meet customer needs and to expand our reach where we believe we can obtain profitable growth.\nProperty and Casualty\nWe offer our personal and commercial property and casualty lines of business primarily through our multiple line agencies. We favor a balanced, focused and collaborative approach to both growth and profitability through the development of successful agencies.\nTo acquire and retain profitable business, we use sophisticated pricing models and risk segmentation, along with a focused distribution force. We believe this approach allows us to make product enhancements and offer programs that are charging an appropriate premium for the risk.\nDemand for property and casualty credit-related insurance products continues to increase. We continue to update credit-related insurance product offerings and pricing to meet changing market needs, as well as adding new agents to expand market share in the credit-related insurance market. We are reviewing and implementing procedures to enhance customer service while, simultaneously, looking for efficiencies to reduce administrative costs.\nCompetitive Pressures: The property and casualty insurance industry remains highly competitive. Despite the competitive environment, we expect to identify profitable opportunities through our strong distribution channels, expanding geographic coverage, marketing efforts, new product development and pricing sophistication.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nHealth\nAs a result of the Healthcare Acts of 2010 new opportunities were created in the limited benefit and supplemental product markets. In recent years, we built a portfolio of such products to be sold in the worksite market as well as to individuals. We believe that changes to the Healthcare Acts that removed the tax consequences for not having health coverage and the current removal of limitations on Short-Term Medical products could significantly increase our production. We constantly monitor the legislative environment for new changes that would impact our outlook on these products.\nWe also continue to expand our presence and product portfolio in the worksite market to generate new opportunities in the broker market, as well as developing and implementing a captive sales force.\nWe expect our Managing General Underwriter ( MGU\u201d) business to remain stable during 2022. We generally retain only 10% of the premiums and risks produced by MGUs. The majority of the revenue generated from this business is fee income included in Other income\u201d of the Health segment's operating results.\nWe have decided to exit the Medicare Supplement market due to increasing pricing pressures and deterioration of new sales and operational performance. Marketing efforts are refocused to MGU, Worksite and Individual Supplemental lines of business.\nSale of Equity Securities Portfolio\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, we sold the majority of our equity securities portfolio. Such sale was based upon senior management's assessment of market conditions and the potential for changes in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate. The sale resulted in net proceeds of $1.7 billion and did not have a significant impact on our stockholders' equity.\nProceeds from the sale of the equity securities portfolio will be reinvested primarily in fixed income investments. We expect that such sale, coupled with the reinvestment of proceeds in primarily fixed income investments, will have a positive impact on our net investment income and cash flows, as well as on the Risk Based Capital of our insurance company subsidiaries that held equity security investments. Such actions will also mitigate fluctuations in net income associated with non-cash earnings from net gains (losses) from the change in fair value of equity securities.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that often involve a significant degree of judgment. These estimates and judgments include expectations of current and future mortality, morbidity, persistency, claims and claim adjustment expenses, recoverability of receivables, investment returns and interest rates which extend well into the future. In developing these estimates there is inherent uncertainty, and material changes to facts and circumstances may develop. Although variability is inherent in these estimates, we believe the amounts as reported are appropriate based upon the facts available upon compilation of the consolidated financial statements.\nOn an ongoing basis, management reviews the estimates and assumptions used in preparing the financial statements. If current facts and circumstances warrant modifications in estimates and assumptions, our financial position and results of operations as reported in the consolidated financial statements could change significantly.\nA description of these critical accounting estimates is presented below. Also, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nFuture Policy Benefits\nLife and Annuity Liability for Unpaid Claims\nLife Reserving-Principal assumptions used in the determination of the reserves for future policy benefits are mortality, policy lapse rates, investment return, inflation, expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type. Reserves for incurred but not reported ( IBNR\u201d) claims on life policies are calculated using historical claims information. Reserves for interest-sensitive and variable universal life insurance policies are equal to the current account value calculated for the policyholder. Some of our universal life policies contain secondary guarantees, for which additional reserves are recorded based on the term of the policy.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nAnnuity Reserving-Reserves for payout annuities with more than insignificant amounts of mortality risk are calculated in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for limited pay insurance contracts. Benefit and maintenance expense reserves are calculated by using assumptions reflecting our expectations of future costs, including an appropriate margin for adverse deviation. These assumptions are locked-in at issue and generally reflect pricing assumptions from that period. If the resulting reserve would otherwise cause profits to be recognized at the issue date, additional reserves are recorded. The resulting recognition of profits would be gradual over the expected life of the contract.\nReserves for fixed deferred annuities are established equivalent to the account value held on behalf of the policyholder. Reserves for indexed annuities are calculated in accordance with derivative accounting guidance which defines a host liability for return of principal and guaranteed interest, and an embedded derivative liability for funded benefits in excess of the host guarantee. Additional reserves for benefits that can exceed contract fund value, such as lifetime income riders, are determined as needed in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. The profit recognition on deferred annuity contracts is gradual over the expected life of the contract. No immediate profit is recognized on the sale of the contract.\nKey Assumptions-The following assumptions reflect our best estimates and may impact our life and annuity reserves:\n\u2022Future lapse rates will remain reasonably consistent with our current expectations;\n\u2022Mortality rates will remain reasonably consistent within standard industry mortality table ranges; and\n\u2022Future interest spreads will remain reasonably consistent with our current expectations.\nRecoverability-At least annually, we test the adequacy of the net benefit reserves (policy benefit reserves less DAC) recorded for life insurance and annuity products. To perform the tests, we use our current best-estimate assumptions as to policyholder mortality, persistency, maintenance expenses and invested asset returns.\nFor interest-sensitive business, best-estimate assumptions are updated to reflect observed changes based on experience studies and current economic conditions. We reflect the effect of such assumption changes in DAC and reserve balances accordingly. Due to the long-term nature of many of the liabilities, small changes in certain assumptions may cause large changes in profitability. In particular, changes in estimates of the future invested asset return have a large effect on the degree of reserve adequacy and DAC recoverability.\nFor traditional business, a lock-in\u201d principle applies, whereby the assumptions used to calculate the benefit reserves and DAC are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience. These include margins for adverse deviation in the event that actual experience differs from the original assumptions.\nHealth Liability for Unpaid Claims\nHealth liabilities for unpaid claims are established using the following methods:\nCompletion Factor Approach-This method assumes that the historical claim patterns will be an accurate representation of unpaid claim liabilities. An estimate of the unpaid claims is calculated by subtracting period-to-date paid claims from an estimate of the ultimate complete\u201d payment for all incurred claims in the period. Completion factors are calculated which complete\u201d the current period-to-date payment totals for each incurred month to estimate the ultimate expected payout.\nTabular Claims Reserves-This method is used to calculate the reserves for long-term care and disability income blocks of business. These reserves rely on published valuation continuance tables created using industry experience regarding assumptions of continued morbidity and subsequent recovery. Reserves are calculated by applying these continuance tables, along with appropriate company experience adjustments, to the stream of contractual benefit payments. These expected benefit payments are discounted at the required interest rate.\nFuture Policy Benefits-Reserves are equal to the aggregate of the present value of expected future benefit payments, less the present value of expected future premiums. Morbidity and termination assumptions are based on our experience or published valuation tables when available and appropriate.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nPremium Deficiency Reserves-Deficiency reserves are established when the expected future claim payments and expenses for a classification of policies are in excess of the expected premiums for these policies. The determination of a deficiency reserve takes into consideration the likelihood of premium rate increases, the timing of these increases, future net investment income, and the expected benefit utilization patterns. We have established premium deficiency reserves for portions of the major medical business and the long-term care business that are in run-off. The assumptions and methods used to determine the deficiency reserves are reviewed periodically for reasonableness, and the reserve amount is monitored against emerging losses.\nProperty and Casualty Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses\nLiability for unpaid claims and Claim Adjustment Expense ( CAE\u201d)-Property and casualty liability for unpaid claims and CAE are established to provide for the estimated cost of settling and paying both reported as well as IBNR claims. The two major categories of CAE are defense and cost containment expense, and adjusting and other expense. The details of property and casualty liability for unpaid claims are shown below (in thousands):\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Gross </td> <td> </td> <td>Ceded </td> <td> </td> <td>Net </td> <td> </td> <td>Gross </td> <td> </td> <td>Ceded </td> <td> </td> <td>Net </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Case </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>673,929 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>71,408 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>602,521 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>628,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,081 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>568,648 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IBNR </td> <td> </td> <td>549,223 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,788 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>511,435 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>518,358 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,926 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>485,432 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,223,152 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>109,196 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,113,956 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,147,087 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>93,007 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,054,080 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCase Reserves-Reserves for reported losses are determined on either a judgment or a formula basis, depending on the timing and type of the loss. The formula reserve is a fixed amount for each claim of a given type based on historical paid loss data for similar claims with a provision for claim inflation. Judgment reserve amounts replace initial formula reserves and are set for each loss based on facts and circumstances of each case and the expectation of damages. We regularly monitor the adequacy of reserves on a case-by-case basis and change the amount of such reserves as necessary.\nIBNR-IBNR liabilities are estimated based on many variables including historical statistical information, inflation, legal environment, economic conditions, trends in claim severity and frequency as well as other factors affecting the adequacy of claim reserves. Loss and premium data is aggregated by exposure class and by accident year. IBNR liabilities are estimated by projecting ultimate losses on each class of business and subtracting paid losses and case reserves. Our overall reserve practice provides for ongoing claims evaluation and adjustment based on the development of related data and other relevant information pertaining to claims. Adjustments in aggregate reserves, if any, are included in the results of operations for the period during which such adjustments are made.\nThe property and casualty liabilities for unpaid claims are established to recognize future development on reported losses for each line of business. The estimation of these amounts is subject to significant uncertainty due to the volatile nature of property and casualty insurance liabilities. The estimation process is based significantly on the assumption that past developments are an appropriate predictor of future events and involves a variety of actuarial techniques that analyze experience, trends and other relevant factors. See the following paragraphs as well as Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 12, Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe evaluation process to determine liability for unpaid claims involves the collaboration of underwriting, claims and actuarial departments. The process also includes consultation with independent actuarial firms as part of our process of gaining reassurance that claims and CAE liability estimate sufficiently, all obligations arising from all losses incurred as of year-end.\nPremium Deficiency Reserve-Deficiency reserves are recorded when the expected claims payments and policy maintenance costs for a product line exceed the expected premiums for that product line. The estimation of a deficiency reserve considers the current profitability of a product line using anticipated claims, CAE, and policy maintenance costs. The assumptions and methods used to determine the need for deficiency reserves are reviewed periodically for reasonableness. There were no reserves of this type at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nProperty and Casualty Reserving Methodology-The following methods are utilized:\n\u2022Initial Expected Loss Ratio-This method calculates an estimate of ultimate losses by applying an estimated loss ratio to actual earned premium for each calendar/accident year. This method is appropriate for classes of business where the actual paid or reported loss experience is not yet mature enough to influence initial expectations of the ultimate loss ratios.\n\u2022Pegged Frequency and Severity-This method uses actual claims count data and emergence patterns of older accident periods to project the ultimate number of reported claims for a given accident year. A similar process projects the ultimate average severity per claim so that the product of the two projections results in a projection of ultimate loss for a given accident year.\n\u2022Bornhuetter-Ferguson-This method uses, as a starting point, either an assumed Initial Expected Loss Ratio Method or Pegged Frequency and Severity method and blends in the loss ratio or frequency and severity implied by the claims experience to date by using loss development patterns based on our historical experience. This method is generally appropriate where there are few reported claims and an unstable pattern of reported losses.\n\u2022Loss or Expense Development (Chain Ladder)-This method uses actual loss or defense and cost containment expense data and the historical development profiles on older accident periods to project more recent, less developed periods to their ultimate total. This method is appropriate when there is a relatively stable pattern of loss and expense emergence and a relatively large number of reported claims.\n\u2022Ratio of Paid Defense and Cost Containment Expense to Paid Loss Development-This method uses the ratio of paid defense and cost containment expense to paid loss data and the historical development profiles on older accident periods to project more recent, less developed periods to their ultimate total. In this method, an ultimate ratio of paid defense and cost containment expense to paid loss is selected for each accident period. The selected paid defense and cost containment expense to paid loss ratio is then applied to the selected ultimate loss for each accident period to estimate the ultimate defense and cost containment expense. Paid defense and cost containment expense is then subtracted from the ultimate defense and cost containment expense to calculate the unpaid defense and cost containment expense for that accident period.\n\u2022Calendar Year Paid Adjusting and Other Expense to Paid Loss-This method uses a selected prior calendar years' paid expense to paid loss ratio to project ultimate loss adjustment expenses for adjusting and other expense. A percentage of the selected ratio is applied to the case reserves (depending on the line of insurance) and 100% to the indicated IBNR reserves. These ratios assume that a percentage of the expense is incurred when a claim is opened and the remaining percentage is paid throughout the claim's life.\nThe basis of our selected single point best estimate on a particular line of business is often a blended result from two or more methods (e.g. weighted averages). Our estimate is highly dependent on actuarial and management judgment as to which method(s) is most appropriate for a particular accident year and class of business. Our methodology changes over time, as new information emerges regarding underlying loss activity and other factors.\nKey Assumptions-The following assumptions reflect our best estimates and may impact our property and casualty reserves:\n\u2022The expected loss development patterns, estimated primarily using our historical loss experience;\n\u2022The expected loss ratios, claim frequency and severity, estimated primarily using our historical loss experience;\n\u2022Consistent claims handling, reserving and payment processes;\n\u2022No unusual growth patterns or unexpected changes in the mix of business; and\n\u2022No significant prospective changes in laws that would significantly affect future payouts.\nManagement believes our reserves at December 31, 2021 are adequate. New information, regulation, events or circumstances unknown at the original valuation date, however, may result in future development resulting in ultimate losses being significantly greater or less than the recorded reserves at December 31, 2021.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs (DAC)\nWe had a DAC asset of approximately $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10, Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.\nWe believe the estimates used in our DAC calculations provide insight into how variations in assumptions and estimates would affect our business. The following table displays the sensitivity of reasonably likely changes in assumptions in the DAC amortization for our long-duration business at December 31, 2021 (in thousands):\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) in DAC </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in future investment margins of 25 basis points </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,772 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in future investment margins of 25 basis points </td> <td>(57,127) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in future life mortality by 1% </td> <td>2,189 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in future life mortality by 1% </td> <td>(2,258) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted ASC 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, accounting guidance related to the allowance for credit losses. The new standard significantly changed how entities measure credit losses for most financial assets and reinsurance recoverables that are not measured at fair value through net income. The guidance replaced the current incurred loss\u201d approach with an expected loss\u201d model for instruments measured at amortized cost. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4, Investment in Securities, and Note 5, Mortgage Loans, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the accounting policies and methodologies for establishing the allowance for credit losses.\nThe accounting estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses over financial assets held at amortized cost have been evaluated and monitored since adoption and management has deemed these estimates to be critical for the following reasons:\n\u2022Changes in the provision for credit losses can be material to the financial position and results of operations for the Company;\n\u2022Estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses require us to project future cash flows, delinquencies, collateral values, occupancy rates, prepayments based on a reasonable and supportable forecast in order to estimate probability of default and the loss given default;\n\u2022The allowance for credit losses is also affected by factors outside of our control including, but not limited to, market volatility, deterioration in the credit or prospects of companies and governmental entities, political uncertainty, industry trends, pandemics, and trends in interest rates; and\n\u2022Management judgment is required to determine which models, methodologies, and scenario conditions are used to calculate the allowance for credit losses to produce a reasonable estimate that encompasses the expected lifetime credit losses.\nSince our estimate for the allowance for credit losses relies on management judgment and is sensitive to factors outside of our control, as noted above, there are inherent uncertainties within the estimates. As a result, the changes in the allowance for credit losses could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nValuation of Financial Instruments\nThe fair value of available-for-sale fixed maturity and equity securities is determined by management using one of the three primary sources of information: the quoted prices in active markets, third-party pricing services, or independent broker quotations. Estimated fair value of securities based on quoted prices in active markets is readily and regularly available; therefore, valuation of these securities generally does not involve management judgment. For securities without quoted prices, fair value measurement is determined using third-party pricing services' proprietary pricing applications. Typical inputs used by the models are relevant market information, benchmark curves, benchmark pricing of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing. Any securities remaining unpriced after utilizing the first two pricing methods are submitted to independent brokers for prices. We have analyzed the third-party pricing services and independent brokers' valuation methodologies and related inputs, and have evaluated the various types of securities in our investment portfolio to determine an appropriate fair value hierarchy level based upon trading activity and the observability of market inputs. Management completes certain tests throughout the year and at year-end to determine that prices provided by our pricing services are reasonable.\nThe Company sells equity-indexed universal life and equity-indexed deferred annuity contracts with guaranteed minimum benefits, some of which contain embedded derivatives that are required to be bifurcated from a host reserve, separately accounted for, and measured at fair value. We utilize over-the-counter equity options to hedge our exposure to equity-indexed universal life and equity-indexed deferred annuity benefits, and the fair values for these options are sourced from broker quotations. Accounting guidance requires a fair value calculation as part of equity-indexed policy reserves. This is called the value of embedded derivative (\"VED\") and the other part of the indexed policy reserve is called the host reserve. The embedded derivative represents future benefit cash flows in excess of the minimum guarantee cash flows. The host covers the minimum guarantee cash flows. Both the VED and the host reserve are calculated by a vendor-sourced reserve valuation system. The VED calculation model incorporates assumptions related to current option pricing (such as implied volatility and interest rates), future policyholder behavior (such as surrenders and withdrawals), and factors affecting the value of future indexed interest periods (such as option budgets). These assumptions are evaluated annually by management with any changes in the estimated fair value resulting in a cumulative charge or credit to income from operations.\nLitigation Contingencies\nBased on information currently available, we believe that amounts ultimately paid, if any, arising from existing and currently potential litigation would not have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. However, it should be noted that the frequency of large damage awards, which bear little or no relation to the economic damages incurred by plaintiffs, continues to create the potential for an unpredictable judgment in any given lawsuit. It is possible that, if the defenses in these lawsuits are not successful, and the judgments are greater than we anticipate, the resulting liability could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nSegments\nOur insurance segments do not directly own assets. Rather, assets are allocated to support the liabilities and capital allocated to each segment. The mix of assets allocated to each of the insurance segments is intended to support the characteristics of the insurance liabilities within each segment including expected cash flows and pricing assumptions, and is intended to be sufficient to support each segment's business activities. We have utilized this methodology consistently over all periods presented.\nThe Corporate and Other segment acts as the owner of all invested assets of the Company. The investment income from the invested assets is allocated to the insurance segments in accordance with the assets allocated to each insurance segment. Earnings of the Corporate and Other segment are derived from income related to invested assets not allocated to the insurance segments and from our non-insurance subsidiaries. All realized investment gains and losses, which includes other-than-temporary impairments ( OTTI\u201d) and credit losses, are recorded in this segment.\nITEM 7.

Life insurance sales measure activity associated with gaining new insurance business in the current period, and includes deposits received related to interest sensitive life and universal life-type products. Whereas GAAP premium revenues are associated with policies sold in current and prior periods, and deposits received related to interest sensitive life and universal life-type products are recorded in a policyholder account which is reflected as a liability. Therefore, a reconciliation of premium revenues and insurance sales is not meaningful.\nTotal Life sales increased 9.2% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020 as new life sales rebounded from the COVID-19 economic uncertainties and social distancing practices during 2020.\nPolicy In-force Information\nThe following table summarizes changes in the Life segment's in-force amounts (in thousands):\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change over prior year </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Life insurance in-force </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Traditional life </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>98,142,544 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91,920,577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84,129,193 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,221,967 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,791,384 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-sensitive life </td> <td> </td> <td>38,789,008 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,326,621 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,975,092 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,462,387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,351,529 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total life insurance in-force\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>136,931,552 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>128,247,198 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>118,104,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,684,354 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,142,913 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes changes in the Life segment's number of policies in-force:\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change over prior year </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of policies in-force </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Traditional life </td> <td> </td> <td>1,696,145 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,832,536 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,911,305 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(136,391) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(78,769) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-sensitive life </td> <td> </td> <td>281,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>269,668 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>256,146 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,712 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,522 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total number of policies in-force </td> <td> </td> <td>1,977,525 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,102,204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,167,451 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(124,679) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(65,247) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLife insurance in-force increased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020 despite a reduction of policies in-force due to an increase in sales of higher face amount policies.\nITEM 7.

expenses in the period indicated.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2021 to 2020\nEarnings for our Property and Casualty segment decreased primarily due to the following:\n\u2022An increase in net catastrophe losses and higher claim frequency in our personal automobile products as miles driven have increased\nThe decrease in earnings was partially offset primarily due to the following:\n\u2022Improvement in the combined ratio for our commercial and specialty markets products\nAdditional Information:\n\u2022Net premiums written and earned were reduced by COVID-19 relief policy credits of $1.9 million for personal automobile policies in 2021 compared to $16.8 million for the same period in 2020. Policy credits were $0.9 million for commercial automobile policies in 2020\n\u2022The increase in commissions was primarily attributable to an increase in premiums written for our specialty markets products. The growth in specialty markets products was also the primary driver for the increase in operating expenses and the deferral of policy acquisition expenses outpacing amortization\nITEM 7.

Products offer coverage against unpaid indebtedness as a result of death, disability, involuntary unemployment or untimely loss to the collateral securing a personal or mortgage loan. Specialty markets products also include renters, mortgage security, aviation, and private flood insurance.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2021 to 2020\nNet written and earned premiums increased primarily due to higher production on renters products and the addition of new accounts related to the investor property protection products. The loss and loss adjustment expense and combined ratios improved primarily due to lower losses for Credit GAP products, partially offset by an increase in net catastrophe losses from $4.2 million in 2020 to $12.3 million in 2021.\nReinsurance\nWe reinsure a portion of the risks that we underwrite to manage our loss exposure. In return for ceded premiums, reinsurers assume a portion of the claims incurred. In addition to our reinsurance coverage, we are partially protected by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 and its predecessors. We participate in the National Flood Insurance Program administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\nDuring 2021, we retained the first $2.0 million of loss per risk. Our catastrophe reinsurance retention covering property and casualty companies in total is $35.0 million.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's catastrophe reinsurance coverage effective during 2021:\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Layer of Loss </td> <td> </td> <td>Catastrophe Reinsurance Coverage In-Force </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less than $35.0 million </td> <td> </td> <td>100% of loss retained except for certain losses covered by the Property Catastrophe Top and Drop and Aggregate Property Catastrophe Excess covers (coverage described below)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$35.0 million - $470.0 million </td> <td> </td> <td>95% of multiple peril losses covered by Corporate Program (1) (all perils)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$470.0 million - $500.0 million </td> <td> </td> <td>100% of multiple peril losses covered by Corporate Program (1) (all perils)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)The Corporate Program covers all non-credit property and casualty business, subject to certain limits and is not specific to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any state or region. The program also covers the renters, mortgage security, investor protection, and auto GAP business written by the Specialty Markets Group.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nEach per-event coverage above includes one automatic reinstatement except for a 12.5% portion of the Corporate Program (12.5% of $35.0 million to $470.0 million). The automatic reinstatement requires us to pay additional reinsurance premium for any losses into each reinsurance layer. The reinstatement premium is prorated by the percentage of actual loss to the coverage, with the exception of 47.5% of losses from $35.0 million to $100.0 million, that reflects a 50% reduction on the prorated amount. The 12.5% placement of non-reinstateable coverage reduces the amount of reinstatement premium we are obligated to pay.\nThe Property Catastrophe Top and Drop cover consists of $30.0 million of annual limit available either wholly or in part across two layers of coverage. The first layer is 100% of $30.0 million excess of $470.0 million on an occurrence basis. The second layer provides aggregate protection where subject loss is $15.0 million excess of $20.0 million of each catastrophe, and recoveries follow satisfaction of a $15.0 million annual aggregate deductible. The second layer acts to reduce the retention on large second and third catastrophe events to $20.0 million following a first large catastrophe. This cover was placed at 100% for 2021 and does not include a reinstatement.\nThe Aggregate Property Catastrophe Excess cover provides for $30.0 million of limit excess of $160.0 million of aggregated catastrophe losses. Qualifying losses include amounts of retained losses net of other reinsurance below $35.0 million on Property Claims Services ( PCS\u201d) declared catastrophe events and internally declared catastrophe events exceeding $5.0 million. This cover was placed at 55% for 2021 and does not include a reinstatement.\nWe use multiple reinsurers with each reinsurer absorbing part of the overall risk ceded.

The actual final cost of settling both claims outstanding at December 31, 2021 and claims expected to arise from unexpired periods of risk is uncertain. There are many other possible changes that would cause losses to increase or decrease, which include but are not limited to claim severity; the expected level of reported claims; judicial action changing the scope or liability of coverage; the regulatory, social and economic environment; and unexpected changes in loss inflation.

The results for 2019 have not been restated to conform to the current presentation.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2021 to 2020\nEarnings for our Corporate and Other segment increased primarily due to the following:\n\u2022A favorable change in investment credit loss due to improvement in our commercial mortgage loans driven by improvement in cash flows and a positive economic outlook from our properties, and improving conditions in travel and leisure\n\u2022An increase in net investment income from investment funds and mortgage loan profit participation and prepayment income\n\u2022An increase in net gains on equity securities due to more favorable market conditions in 2021 compared to the negative impact from the pandemic in 2020 on the fair value of our equity securities\nThe increase in earnings was partially offset primarily by the following:\n\u2022 An increase in operating expenses primarily due to Merger-related expenses of $21.5 million\nInvestments\nWe manage our investment portfolio to optimize the rate of return commensurate with sound and prudent asset selection and to maintain a well-diversified portfolio in support of our products and capital. Our investment operations are regulated primarily by the state insurance departments where our insurance companies are domiciled. Investment activities, including setting investment policies and defining acceptable risk levels, are subject to oversight by our Board of Directors, which is assisted by our Finance Committee, ALM Committee and Enterprise Risk Management Committee.\nOur insurance and annuity products are generally supported by investment-grade bonds and commercial mortgage loans. We also invest in equity options as a hedge for our indexed products. We purchase fixed maturity securities and designate them as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale considering our estimated future cash flow needs. We also monitor the composition of our fixed maturity securities classified as held-to-maturity and available-for-sale and adjust the mix within the portfolio as investments mature or new investments are purchased.\nITEM 7.

At December 31, 2021, our fixed maturity securities had an estimated fair value of $15.8 billion, which was $0.6 billion, or 4.2%, above amortized cost. At December 31, 2020, our fixed maturity securities had an estimated fair value of $15.6 billion, which was $1.2 billion, or 8.0%, above amortized cost. Unrealized gains decreased on our fixed maturity due to an increase in benchmark ten-year interest rates. For additional information regarding unrealized gains and losses, refer to Part II, Item 7, Investments, Net Unrealized Gains and Losses table. The estimated fair value for securities due in one year or less was $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2021 and $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2020. For additional information regarding total bonds by credit quality rating, refer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4, Investments in Securities, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEquity Securities-We have invested in the equity securities of companies traded on national U.S. stock exchanges. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4, Investments in Securities, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the unrealized and realized gains and losses of equity securities. The Company sold the majority of its equity securities portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2021. For additional information regarding the Sale of Equity Securities Portfolio, see General Trends above.\nMortgage Loans-We invest in commercial mortgage loans that are diversified by property-type and geography. Generally, mortgage loans are secured by first liens on income-producing real estate with a loan-to-value ratio of up to 75%. Mortgage loans are generally carried at outstanding principal balances, adjusted for any unamortized premium or discount, deferred fees or expenses, and net of allowances. The weighted average coupon yield on the principal funded for mortgage loans was 4.6% and 4.8% at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For additional information regarding mortgage loans refer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5, Mortgage Loans, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPolicy Loans-For certain life insurance products, policyholders may borrow funds using the policy's cash value as collateral. The maximum amount of the policy loan depends upon the policy's surrender value. As of December 31, 2021, we had $365.2 million in policy loans with a loan to surrender value of approximately 54%, and at December 31, 2020, we had $373.0 million in policy loans with a loan to surrender value of approximately 56%. Interest rates on policy loans primarily range from 3.0% to 12.0% per annum. Policy loans may be repaid at any time by the policyholder and have priority to any claims on the policy. If the policyholder fails to repay the policy loan, funds are withdrawn from the policy's benefits.\nReal Estate and Real Estate Partnerships-We invest in commercial real estate where positive cash flows and/or appreciation in value is expected. Real estate may be owned directly by our insurance companies or non-insurance affiliates or indirectly in joint ventures with real estate developers or investors we determine share our perspective regarding risk and return relationships. The carrying value of real estate is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairments, if any. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the properties. The carrying value of our real estate partnerships is determined by using the equity method of accounting.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nInvestment Funds-Our investment funds are primarily comprised of senior secured and second lien private loans that are secured by assets, revenues and credit/balance sheet lending. We recognize our share of fund earnings in net investment income on a one-quarter lag under the equity method of accounting. Cash distributions are received from fund earnings and from liquidation of underlying investments.\nShort-Term Investments-Short-term investments are primarily commercial paper rated A2 or P2 or better by Standard & Poor's and Moody's, respectively. The amount fluctuates depending on our view of the desirability of investing in the available long-term investment opportunities and our liquidity needs, including mortgage investment-funding commitments.\nOther Invested Assets-Other invested assets are comprised primarily of pooled loans to mid-sized businesses which are initiated and administered by third-party managers and are carried at fair value. Other invested assets also include equity-indexed options, carried at fair value, net of collateral provided by counterparties; such collateral is restricted to the Company's use. Additionally, other invested assets include FHLB capital stock, mineral rights, mezzanine loans and lease financing arrangements, all of which are carried at cost.\nNet Investment Income and Net Realized Gains (Losses)\nNet investment income increased $195.5 million during 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher gains on options, an increase in investment income from investment funds and mortgage loan prepayment and profit participation income.\nInterest income on mortgage loans is accrued on the principal amount of the loan at the contractual interest rate. Accretion of discounts is recorded using the effective yield method. Interest income, accretion of discounts and prepayment fees are reported in net investment income. Interest is not accrued on loans generally more than 90 days past due or when the collection of interest is not considered probable. Loans in foreclosure are placed on non-accrual status. Interest received on non-accrual status mortgage loans is included in net investment income in the period received.\nNet realized investment gains increased $29.0 million during 2021 compared to 2020 primarily attributable to realized gains from bonds.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nLiquidity\nANAT's source of liquidity is solely derived from dividends received from its wholly owned subsidiary, ANICO.\nThe primary use of cash has been and is expected to continue to be payment of policyholder benefits and claims incurred. Current and expected patterns of claim frequency and severity may change from period to period but continue to be within historical norms. Management considers our current liquidity position to be sufficient to meet anticipated demands over the next twelve months.\nOur contractual obligations are not expected to have a significant negative impact to cash flows from operations. American National has agreed to pay our financial advisor in connection with the Merger, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (\"Citi\"), for its Merger-related services an aggregate fee of $40.0 million, of which $3.0 million was paid upon delivery of Citi's fairness opinion related to the Merger entered into on August 6, 2021 and the remaining $37.0 million is payable contingent upon consummation of the Merger, which has not been reflected in the consolidated statement of operations. In addition, the Company agreed to reimburse Citi for expenses, including fees and expenses of counsel, and to indemnify Citi and related parties against certain liabilities, including liabilities under federal securities laws, arising from Citi's engagement.\nIn April 2020, the Company borrowed $500 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas' COVID-19 Relief Advance Program. As of December 31, 2021, there are no advances outstanding; the final advance was repaid on its maturity date of April 28, 2021. The available liquidity at February 9, 2022 was approximately $879.3 million.\nAs a result of the impacts of COVID-19, state insurance departments across the country issued regulations that required us not to cancel policies for non-payment for varying amounts of time but generally for at least 90-day periods which began in March and April of 2020. The cancellation and grace periods have been lifted in most states.\nOur defined benefit plans are frozen and currently adequately funded; however, low interest rates, increased longevity of participants, and rising Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ( PBGC\u201d) premiums may cause us to increase our funding of the plans.\nWe are currently evaluating the renovation and modernization of our home office facilities. This could result in capital expenditures that could aggregate to approximately $100.0 million over a three-year period; however, current uncertainties relating to the COVID-19 pandemic have caused us to delay this project at this time. There are no other unusually large capital expenditures expected in the next 12-24 months.\nWe have consistently paid dividends to our stockholders and expect to continue this tradition in the foreseeable future. There are no other known trends or uncertainties regarding product pricing, changes in product lines or rising costs that are expected to have a significant impact to cash flows from operations, although uncertainties relating to the COVID-19 pandemic could still significantly impact one or more of these items.\nFunds received as premium payments and deposits that are not used for liquidity requirements are generally invested in bonds and commercial mortgages. Funds are invested with the intent that income from the investments and proceeds from the maturities will meet our ongoing cash flow needs. We historically have not had to liquidate invested assets in order to cover cash flow needs. We believe our portfolio of highly liquid bonds and available-for-sale investment securities coupled with our ability to borrow funds through the FHLB, are sufficient to meet future liquidity needs as necessary.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nAs a result of the economic impact associated with COVID-19, American National modified 93 mortgage loans with a total balance of $1.6 billion during 2020. These modifications were in the form of forbearance of principal and interest payments for up to six months, extensions of maturity dates, and/or provisions for interest only payments. The modifications were primarily related to our loans to hotels, retail and parking operations. Due to the ongoing economic stress brought on by the pandemic, additional modifications for 33 of these loans with a total balance of $725.7 million were made during 2021. These additional modifications extended the forbearance of principal and interest payments and interest only provisions with a requirement for the payment of at least 20% of the total interest due during the extended modification period. The modified loans had an aggregate deferred interest of $5.6 million as of December 31, 2021. There are no commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose loans have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring during the periods presented. The decrease in loans determined to be a troubled debt restructuring during 2021 is primarily attributable to improved economic conditions after lifting of COVID-19 related restrictions.\nThe Company holds collateral of $264.2 million at December 31, 2021 to offset exposure from its derivative counterparties. Cash flows associated with collateral received from counterparties change as the market value of the underlying derivative contract changes.\nOur cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment position increased from $1.4 billion at December 31, 2020 to $3.8 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase primarily relates to the fourth quarter 2021 sale of a majority of the Company's equity securities portfolio which resulted in an excess cash position. We intend to reinvest the cash proceeds consistent with our investment guidelines during 2022.\nA downgrade or a potential downgrade in our financial strength ratings could result in a loss of business and could adversely affect our cash flows from operations. A.M. Best has placed American National's issuer credit and financial strength ratings under review with developing implications and S&P Global Ratings has placed the ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications of which are due to the pending Merger with Brookfield Reinsurance.\nFurther information regarding additional sources or uses of cash is described in Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCapital Resources\nOur capital resources are summarized below (in thousands):\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>American National stockholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI\u201d), net of tax\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,847,314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,236,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,890,231 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accumulated other comprehensive income </td> <td> </td> <td>147,054 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>222,170 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99,518 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total American National stockholders' equity </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,994,368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,458,270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,989,749 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have notes payable relating to borrowings by real estate joint ventures that we consolidate into our financial statements that are not part of our capital resources. The lenders for the notes payable generally have no recourse against us in the event of default by the joint ventures. Therefore, the liability of American National relating to notes payable of the consolidated VIEs is limited to the amount of its direct or indirect investment in the respective ventures, which totaled $3.0 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nITEM 7.

RBC is calculated using formulas applied to certain financial balances and activities that consider, among other things, investment risks related to the type and quality of investments, insurance risks associated with products and liabilities, interest rate risks and general business risks. Insurance companies that do not maintain capital and surplus at a level of at least 100% of the company action level RBC are required to take certain actions. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, ANICO's statutory capital and surplus was $4.0 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. ANICO and each of our insurance subsidiaries had statutory capital and surplus at December 31, 2021 and 2020 above 200% of the company action level except ANPAC Louisiana Insurance Company (\"ANPLA\"), which had an RBC level of 194% at December 31, 2020, which increased to 242% at December 31, 2021.\nThe achievement of long-term growth will require growth in our insurance subsidiaries' statutory capital and surplus.

All amounts are gross of any reinsurance recoverable. Estimated claim, benefit and surrender obligations are based on mortality and lapse assumptions comparable with historical experience. Estimated payments on interest-sensitive life and annuity obligations include interest credited to those products. The interest crediting rates are derived by deducting current product spreads from a constant investment yield. As a result, the estimated obligations for insurance liabilities included in the table exceed the liabilities recorded in the liability for future policy benefits and policy and contract claims. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the amounts presented could materially differ from actual payments. Separate account obligations have not been included in the table since those obligations are not part of the general account obligations and will be funded by cash flows from separate account assets. The general account obligations for insurance liabilities will be funded by cash flows from general account assets and future premiums and deposits. Participating policyholder dividends payable consists of liabilities related to dividends payable in the following calendar year and are presented in the less than one-year category. All estimated cash payments are net of estimated future premiums on policies currently in-force net of future policyholder dividends payable. The participating policyholders' share obligation included in other policyholder funds and the timing and amount of the ultimate participating policyholder obligation is subject to significant uncertainty and the amount of the participating policyholder obligation is based upon a long-term projection of the performance of the participating policy block.\n(2)Includes undiscounted case reserves for reported claims and reserves for IBNR with the timing of future payments based on our historical payment patterns. The timing of these payments may vary significantly from the pattern shown in the preceding table. The ultimate losses may vary materially from the recorded amounts, which are our best estimates.\n(3)Reflects estimated future claim payments for claims incurred based on mortality and morbidity assumptions that are consistent with historical claims experience. These are not discounted with interest and will exceed the liabilities recorded in reserves for future claim payment, which are discounted with interest. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the amounts presented could materially differ from actual payments.\n(4)Estimated payments through continuing operations for benefit obligations of the non-qualified defined benefit pension plan. A liability has been established for the full amount of benefits accrued.\n(5)The estimated payments due by period for notes payable reflect the contractual maturities of principal for amounts borrowed by real estate joint ventures and collateralized by real-estate owned by the respective entity. The entity's liability is limited to its investment in the respective joint venture.

financial strength ratings could result in a loss of business and could adversely affect our cash flows from operations. A.M. Best has placed American National's issuer credit and financial strength ratings under review with developing implications and S&P Global Ratings has placed the ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications of which are due to the pending Merger with Brookfield Reinsurance.\nInterest Rates: The low-interest rate environment is a challenge for life and annuity insurers as the spreads on deposit-type contracts remain narrow, especially as interest rates have approached minimum crediting rates. Low market interest rates reduce the spreads between the amounts we credit to fixed annuity and individual life policyholders and the amounts we earn on the investments that support these obligations. Our ALM Committee actively manages the profitability of these blocks of business. In previous years, we reduced the guaranteed minimum crediting rates on new fixed annuity contracts, which has afforded us the flexibility to respond to the unusually low-interest rate environment. We have also reduced crediting rates on in-force contracts, where permitted to do so. These actions help mitigate the adverse impact of low interest rates on the profitability of these products, although sales volume may be negatively impacted as a result. We also maintain assets with various maturities to support product liabilities and ensure liquidity. A gradual increase in longer-term interest rates relative to short-term rates generally will have a favorable effect on the profitability of our products. Rapidly rising interest rates could result in reduced persistency of our spread-based products, if contract holders shift assets into higher yielding investments. We believe our ability to react quickly to the changing marketplace will help us manage this risk.\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that often involve a significant degree of judgment. These estimates and judgments include expectations of current and future mortality, morbidity, persistency, claims and claim adjustment expenses, recoverability of receivables, investment returns and interest rates which extend well into the future.

The automatic reinstatement requires us to pay additional reinsurance premium for any losses into each reinsurance layer. The reinstatement premium is prorated by the percentage of actual loss to the coverage, with the exception of 47.5% of losses from $35.0 million to $100.0 million, that reflects a 50% reduction on the prorated amount. The 12.5% placement of non-reinstateable coverage reduces the amount of reinstatement premium we are obligated to pay.\n\n\nThe following sets forth the consolidated results of operations (in thousands):\n\u2022Improvement in the combined ratio for our commercial and specialty markets products\n\u2022We continue to take steps to protect employees with the goals of maintaining their health and sustaining an adequate workforce, including employees working from home and offering flexibility for employees negotiating scheduling conflicts due to the impacts of COVID-19, such as caring for family, alternative arrangements and shutdowns for business and schools, self-isolation or personal illness, including granting additional paid time off for vaccinations and to address these hardships.\n\nAnnuity premiums and deposits increased primarily for equity-indexed and fixed deferred products during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020 reflecting improved competitiveness of the product. The decrease in earned premium is due to a decline in single premium annuity sales.\nNet Investment Income and Net Realized Gains (Losses)\nCapital Resources\nThe above is a summary of certain material terms of the Merger Agreement and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which was filed as an exhibit to the Company's current report on Form 8-K filed on August 9, 2021.\nContractual Obligations\nOur insurance segments do not directly own assets. Rather, assets are allocated to support the liabilities and capital allocated to each segment. The mix of assets allocated to each of the insurance segments is intended to support the characteristics of the insurance liabilities within each segment including expected cash flows and pricing assumptions, and is intended to be sufficient to support each segment's business activities. We have utilized this methodology consistently over all periods presented.\nFuture Policy Benefits-Reserves are equal to the aggregate of the present value of expected future benefit payments, less the present value of expected future premiums. Morbidity and termination assumptions are based on our experience or published valuation tables when available and appropriate.\nHealth earned premiums for the periods indicated were as follows (in thousands):\n\u2022An increase in operating expenses primarily due to Merger-related expenses of $21.5 million\nKey Assumptions-The following assumptions reflect our best estimates and may impact our property and casualty reserves:\nLife insurance sales are based on the total yearly premium that insurance companies would expect to receive if all recurring premium policies remain in-force, plus 10% of single and excess premiums. Life insurance sales measure activity associated with gaining new insurance business in the current period, and includes deposits received related to interest sensitive life and universal life-type products. Whereas GAAP premium revenues are associated with policies sold in current and prior periods, and deposits received related to interest sensitive life and universal life-type products are recorded in a policyholder account which is reflected as a liability. Therefore, a reconciliation of premium revenues and insurance sales is not meaningful.\nWe believe we will continue to be competitive in the life and annuity markets through our broad line of products, diverse distribution channels, and consistent high level of customer service. We modify our products to meet customer needs and to expand our reach where we believe we can obtain profitable growth.\n(1)The Corporate Program covers all non-credit property and casualty business, subject to certain limits and is not specific to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any state or region.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\n\nOverview\n\u2022Future lapse rates will remain reasonably consistent with our current expectations;\nThe interest rate environment affects estimated future profit projections, which could impact the amortization of our DAC assets and the estimates of policyholder liabilities. Significantly lower future estimated profits may cause us to accelerate the amortization of DAC or require us to establish additional policyholder liabilities, thereby reducing earnings. We periodically review assumptions with respect to future earnings to ensure they remain appropriate considering the current interest rate environment.\nSpecialty markets products provide protection to borrowers and the creditors that extend credit to them. Products offer coverage against unpaid indebtedness as a result of death, disability, involuntary unemployment or untimely loss to the collateral securing a personal or mortgage loan. Specialty markets products also include renters, mortgage security, aviation, and private flood insurance.\nPersonal Products results for the periods indicated were as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nFor interest-sensitive business, best-estimate assumptions are updated to reflect observed changes based on experience studies and current economic conditions. We reflect the effect of such assumption changes in DAC and reserve balances accordingly. Due to the long-term nature of many of the liabilities, small changes in certain assumptions may cause large changes in profitability. In particular, changes in estimates of the future invested asset return have a large effect on the degree of reserve adequacy and DAC recoverability.\n\nThe change in DAC represents acquisition costs capitalized less the amortization of existing DAC, which is calculated in proportion to expected gross profits. The following shows the components of the change in DAC (in thousands):\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\n\u2022A favorable mark-to-market impact to equity-indexed annuity reserves primarily due to higher treasury rates\nAs a result of the impacts of COVID-19, state insurance departments across the country issued regulations that required us not to cancel policies for non-payment for varying amounts of time but generally for at least 90-day periods which began in March and April of 2020. The cancellation and grace periods have been lifted in most states.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\n(3)Reflects estimated future claim payments for claims incurred based on mortality and morbidity assumptions that are consistent with historical claims experience. These are not discounted with interest and will exceed the liabilities recorded in reserves for future claim payment, which are discounted with interest. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the amounts presented could materially differ from actual payments.\nTabular Claims Reserves-This method is used to calculate the reserves for long-term care and disability income blocks of business. These reserves rely on published valuation continuance tables created using industry experience regarding assumptions of continued morbidity and subsequent recovery. Reserves are calculated by applying these continuance tables, along with appropriate company experience adjustments, to the stream of contractual benefit payments. These expected benefit payments are discounted at the required interest rate.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2021 to 2020\n\u2022Pegged Frequency and Severity-This method uses actual claims count data and emergence patterns of older accident periods to project the ultimate number of reported claims for a given accident year. A similar process projects the ultimate average severity per claim so that the product of the two projections results in a projection of ultimate loss for a given accident year.\nThe unrealized gains and losses of our fixed maturity securities investment portfolio are shown below (in thousands):\nLife segment financial results for the periods indicated were as follows (in thousands):\nWe cede or retrocede the majority of the premium and risk associated with our stop-loss and other MGU programs. We maintain reinsurance on a quota share basis for our long-term care and long-term disability income business.\nWe have off-balance sheet arrangements relating to third-party marketing operation bank loans as discussed in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We could be exposed to a liability for these loans, which are supported by the cash value of the underlying insurance contracts. The cash value of the life insurance policies is designed to always equal or exceed the balance of the loans. Accordingly, management does not foresee any material loss related to these arrangements.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\n\u2022The expected loss development patterns, estimated primarily using our historical loss experience;\nOn an ongoing basis, management reviews the estimates and assumptions used in preparing the financial statements. If current facts and circumstances warrant modifications in estimates and assumptions, our financial position and results of operations as reported in the consolidated financial statements could change significantly.\nDemand for property and casualty credit-related insurance products continues to increase. We continue to update credit-related insurance product offerings and pricing to meet changing market needs, as well as adding new agents to expand market share in the credit-related insurance market. We are reviewing and implementing procedures to enhance customer service while, simultaneously, looking for efficiencies to reduce administrative costs.\n\nThe following table summarizes changes in the Life segment's number of policies in-force:\nRecoverability-At least annually, we test the adequacy of the net benefit reserves (policy benefit reserves less DAC) recorded for life insurance and annuity products. To perform the tests, we use our current best-estimate assumptions as to policyholder mortality, persistency, maintenance expenses and invested asset returns.\nBusiness Owner: Our business owner product allows policyholders to customize and cover their property and liability exposures using a package policy. Net premiums written and earned increased primarily due to increases in policies in-force and rate increases. The loss and loss adjustment expense and combined ratios improved primarily due to more favorable claim development compared to prior year.\nOther Commercial: Other commercial products primarily provide umbrella and other liability coverages. Net premiums written and earned increased primarily due to an increase in premium for umbrella products. The loss and loss adjustment expense and combined ratios improved primarily due to favorable prior year claim development.\nIncreased Role of Advanced Technology: The use of mobile technology has changed the way consumers want to conduct their business, including real-time access to information. Many customers expect to complete transactions in a digital format instead of traditional methods that require a phone call or submission of paper forms. Social media and other customer-facing technologies also reshape the way companies communicate and collaborate with key stakeholders, and new tools exist to better collect and analyze information for potential business opportunities and better management of risks. For example, we have mobile-enabled all internet-based access and leveraged social media channels to reach out to potential customers to promote awareness of the company, including the products and services offered. We expect that technology will continue to evolve, offering new and more effective ways to reach and service our customers and shareholders. We evaluate available and evolving technologies and incorporate those we believe offer appropriate benefits to the company and its customers.\nThe foregoing review of important factors related to the Proposed Transaction should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included herein and elsewhere, including the risk factors included in Brookfield Reinsurance's Registration Statement on Form and in this 2021 Annual Report and other documents of the Company and Brookfield Reinsurance on file with the SEC. Neither the Company nor Brookfield Reinsurance undertakes any obligation to update, correct or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements.

In our discussion below, we first outline the broad macro-economic or industry trends (General Trends) that we expect to impact our overall business. Second, we discuss certain segment-specific trends we believe may impact individual segments or specific products within these segments.\n\u2022Initial Expected Loss Ratio-This method calculates an estimate of ultimate losses by applying an estimated loss ratio to actual earned premium for each calendar/accident year. This method is appropriate for classes of business where the actual paid or reported loss experience is not yet mature enough to influence initial expectations of the ultimate loss ratios.\n\u2022the Company or Brookfield Reinsurance may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors as well as management's response to any of the aforementioned factors.\n\n\u2022The allowance for credit losses is also affected by factors outside of our control including, but not limited to, market volatility, deterioration in the credit or prospects of companies and governmental entities, political uncertainty, industry trends, pandemics, and trends in interest rates; and\nDemographics: We believe a key driver shaping the actions of the life insurance industry is the rising income protection, wealth accumulation and insurance needs of an increasing number of retirees. As a result of increasing longevity and uncertainty regarding the Social Security System and an ongoing transition from defined benefit pension plans to 401(k) type retirement plans, retirees will need to accumulate sufficient savings to support retirement income requirements.\n(1)Result of adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\nAutomobile: Net premiums written decreased primarily due to fewer policies in-force. Net premiums earned increased primarily due to a decrease in COVID-19 relief policy credits which were $1.9 million in 2021 compared to $16.8 million in 2020. The loss and loss adjustment expense and combined ratios increased primarily due to an increase in claim frequency compared to the prior year due to the lessening impact of COVID-19.\n\u2022An increase in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (\"DAC\") related to corrective actions impacting contract issue and administration processes, as well as an increase in claims in our Worksite line of business driven by short-term disability\n\u2022Calendar Year Paid Adjusting and Other Expense to Paid Loss-This method uses a selected prior calendar years' paid expense to paid loss ratio to project ultimate loss adjustment expenses for adjusting and other expense. A percentage of the selected ratio is applied to the case reserves (depending on the line of insurance) and 100% to the indicated IBNR reserves. These ratios assume that a percentage of the expense is incurred when a claim is opened and the remaining percentage is paid throughout the claim's life.\n\u2022Changes in the provision for credit losses can be material to the financial position and results of operations for the Company;\nIn addition, the Company has agreed to specific restrictions relating to the conduct of its business between the date of the Merger Agreement and the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, not to take (or permit any of its subsidiaries to take) the following actions (subject, in each case, to exceptions specified below and in the Merger Agreement or previously disclosed in writing to Brookfield Reinsurance as provided in the Merger Agreement or as consented to in writing in advance by Brookfield Reinsurance (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) or as required by law:\nProperty and Casualty\nReserves for fixed deferred annuities are established equivalent to the account value held on behalf of the policyholder. Reserves for indexed annuities are calculated in accordance with derivative accounting guidance which defines a host liability for return of principal and guaranteed interest, and an embedded derivative liability for funded benefits in excess of the host guarantee. Additional reserves for benefits that can exceed contract fund value, such as lifetime income riders, are determined as needed in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. The profit recognition on deferred annuity contracts is gradual over the expected life of the contract. No immediate profit is recognized on the sale of the contract.\n\u2022incur, guarantee or assume any indebtedness, subject to certain limited exceptions, including investment portfolio transactions in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and other incurrences of indebtedness not to exceed $10,000,000 in the aggregate;\nWe use reinsurance to mitigate certain risks to the Life segment. During 2021, our retention limits were $5.0 million for issue ages 75 and under, and $2.0 million for issue ages 76 through 80, and $1.0 million for issue ages 81 and older for traditional and universal life. In our Life segment, we currently retain 100% of newly developed permanent and term products up to our retention limit and cede the excess. American National utilizes facultative reinsurance when a case requires support that does not follow the Company's standard underwriting guidelines. Accidental death and premium waiver benefits are mostly retained on new business. The reduction in reinsurance ceded is due to a change in retention limits effective January 1, 2019.\n\u2022Mortality rates will remain reasonably consistent within standard industry mortality table ranges; and\n\u2022Estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses require us to project future cash flows, delinquencies, collateral values, occupancy rates, prepayments based on a reasonable and supportable forecast in order to estimate probability of default and the loss given default;\n\u2022enter into any material contract or reinsurance contract other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice; and\n(1)A.M.

The impacts of the change in estimate consist of an increase to policyholder benefits of $47.1 million, deferred policy acquisition costs of $26.3 million and a reduction in interest credited to policyholders' account balances of $96.4 million\nPremium Deficiency Reserves-Deficiency reserves are established when the expected future claim payments and expenses for a classification of policies are in excess of the expected premiums for these policies. The determination of a deficiency reserve takes into consideration the likelihood of premium rate increases, the timing of these increases, future net investment income, and the expected benefit utilization patterns. We have established premium deficiency reserves for portions of the major medical business and the long-term care business that are in run-off. The assumptions and methods used to determine the deficiency reserves are reviewed periodically for reasonableness, and the reserve amount is monitored against emerging losses.\n\u2022subject to certain limited exceptions, offer, issue, sell, transfer, pledge, dispose of or encumber any shares of, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, or options, warrants, calls, commitments or rights of any kind to acquire, any shares of capital stock or other voting or equity interests of any class or series of the Company or its subsidiaries;\nCertain statements made in this report, including but not limited to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto appearing in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data herein, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Item 7 (\"MD&A\"), and the exhibits and financial statement schedules filed as a part hereof or incorporated by reference herein, may contain or incorporate by reference information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally are indicated by words such as expects,\u201d intends,\u201d anticipates,\u201d plans,\u201d believes,\u201d estimates,\u201d will\u201d or words of similar meaning, and include, without limitation, statements regarding the outlook of our business and expected financial performance, and certain statements relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential effects on the Company. These forward-looking statements are subject to changes and uncertainties which are, in many instances, beyond our control and have been made based upon our assumptions, expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect upon us. There can be no assurance that future developments will be in accordance with our expectations, that the effect of future developments on us will be as anticipated, or that our risk management policies and procedures will be effective, particularly given the uncertainty relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. We do not make public specific projections relating to future earnings, and we do not endorse any projections regarding future performance made by others. Additionally, we do not publicly update or revise forward-looking statements based on the outcome of various foreseeable or unforeseeable events. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve various risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements relate to the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the \"Proposed Transaction\"), as well as to the Company's financial and operating performance on a stand-alone basis prior to the consummation of the Merger or if the Merger is not consummated. There are certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ, possibly materially, from expectations or estimates reflected in such forward-looking statements, including without limitation risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, above and elsewhere in this report, and the following factors relating the Proposed Transaction:\nOur Property and Casualty segment consists of: (i) Personal products, marketed primarily to individuals, representing 52% of net premiums written; (ii) Commercial products, focused primarily on agricultural and other business related markets, representing 30% of net premiums written; and (iii) Specialty Markets Group products, marketed through independent managing general agents and managing general underwriters, representing 18% of net premiums written.\n\nCompetitive Pressures: The property and casualty insurance industry remains highly competitive. Despite the competitive environment, we expect to identify profitable opportunities through our strong distribution channels, expanding geographic coverage, marketing efforts, new product development and pricing sophistication.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization formally declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 to be a pandemic. A summary of significant actions the Company took in response to COVID-19 through December 31, 2020 is disclosed in our 2020 Annual Report on form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 4, 2021. Below is a summary of significant subsequent developments in our COVID-19 response:\nWe have notes payable relating to borrowings by real estate joint ventures that we consolidate into our financial statements that are not part of our capital resources. The lenders for the notes payable generally have no recourse against us in the event of default by the joint ventures. Therefore, the liability of American National relating to notes payable of the consolidated VIEs is limited to the amount of its direct or indirect investment in the respective ventures, which totaled $3.0 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\u2022We suspended our summer Internship Program for 2020, and in 2021 piloted a program which combined both virtual and in-person elements for a small group of interns.

IBNR liabilities are estimated by projecting ultimate losses on each class of business and subtracting paid losses and case reserves. Our overall reserve practice provides for ongoing claims evaluation and adjustment based on the development of related data and other relevant information pertaining to claims. Adjustments in aggregate reserves, if any, are included in the results of operations for the period during which such adjustments are made.\nAnnuity\n\u2022subject to certain limited exceptions (including permitting the Company to execute investment portfolio transactions in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and in accordance with its existing investment plan and investment guidelines), acquire or agree to acquire any business or any corporation, partnership, association or other business organization or division thereof;\n\u2022A decrease in Property and Casualty segment earnings driven by an increase in net catastrophe losses and higher claim frequency in our personal automobile products as miles driven have increased\n\u2022An increase in fee income from various MGU programs\nAs a result of the Healthcare Acts of 2010 new opportunities were created in the limited benefit and supplemental product markets. In recent years, we built a portfolio of such products to be sold in the worksite market as well as to individuals. We believe that changes to the Healthcare Acts that removed the tax consequences for not having health coverage and the current removal of limitations on Short-Term Medical products could significantly increase our production. We constantly monitor the legislative environment for new changes that would impact our outlook on these products.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2021 to 2020\nEarnings for our Health segment decreased primarily due to the following:\nWe manage our investment portfolio to optimize the rate of return commensurate with sound and prudent asset selection and to maintain a well-diversified portfolio in support of our products and capital. Our investment operations are regulated primarily by the state insurance departments where our insurance companies are domiciled. Investment activities, including setting investment policies and defining acceptable risk levels, are subject to oversight by our Board of Directors, which is assisted by our Finance Committee, ALM Committee and Enterprise Risk Management Committee.\nCaution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nLife Insurance Sales\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, we sold the majority of our equity securities portfolio. Such sale was based upon senior management's assessment of market conditions and the potential for changes in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate. The sale resulted in net proceeds of $1.7 billion and did not have a significant impact on our stockholders' equity.\nThe Company holds collateral of $264.2 million at December 31, 2021 to offset exposure from its derivative counterparties. Cash flows associated with collateral received from counterparties change as the market value of the underlying derivative contract changes.\nChange in Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nAlthough we have been able to maintain our business operations since the onset of the pandemic, no assurance can be given that these actions will continue to be successful, nor can we predict the level of disruption that will occur should the COVID-19 pandemic and its related macroeconomic risks continue for further extended periods of time. Given this uncertainty, we are unable to quantify with reasonable confidence the total expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our future operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. The wide-ranging social, economic and financial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and the possible effects of ongoing and future governmental action in response to COVID-19 compound this uncertainty. Additional information regarding risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic are set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. For additional information regarding the direct and indirect impact to mortality refer to Part II, Item 7, MD&A, Life.\nDuring 2021, we retained the first $2.0 million of loss per risk. Our catastrophe reinsurance retention covering property and casualty companies in total is $35.0 million.\nTo address these challenges, we continue to seek out new and expanded uses for technology and social media that enhance our employer brand and educate candidates on the many benefits of working for us. Our planning and outreach efforts to develop a more diverse and inclusive workplace continue and help to strengthen the engagement of current employees as well as attract future employees. We continue to amplify the voice of our employees with regular surveys which help us grow and innovate. We actively value the perspectives that each employee brings and encourage broader employee influence on how decisions are made. As a result, we continue to experience increase in overall employee engagement. Providing robust career development conversations and career paths, personal growth opportunities and effective succession planning are also important elements of our retention and employee development efforts.\n\u2022Future interest spreads will remain reasonably consistent with our current expectations.\nInterest income on mortgage loans is accrued on the principal amount of the loan at the contractual interest rate. Accretion of discounts is recorded using the effective yield method. Interest income, accretion of discounts and prepayment fees are reported in net investment income. Interest is not accrued on loans generally more than 90 days past due or when the collection of interest is not considered probable. Loans in foreclosure are placed on non-accrual status. Interest received on non-accrual status mortgage loans is included in net investment income in the period received.\n\n(2)Includes undiscounted case reserves for reported claims and reserves for IBNR with the timing of future payments based on our historical payment patterns.

The loss and loss adjustment expense and combined ratios improved primarily due to lower losses for Credit GAP products, partially offset by an increase in net catastrophe losses from $4.2 million in 2020 to $12.3 million in 2021.\n\n\u2022Lower DAC amortization for fixed deferred products due to an increase in estimated gross profits driven by higher projected future interest rates compared to previous expectations\nThe accounting estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses over financial assets held at amortized cost have been evaluated and monitored since adoption and management has deemed these estimates to be critical for the following reasons:\nThe following table summarizes the Company's catastrophe reinsurance coverage effective during 2021:\nProceeds from the sale of the equity securities portfolio will be reinvested primarily in fixed income investments. We expect that such sale, coupled with the reinvestment of proceeds in primarily fixed income investments, will have a positive impact on our net investment income and cash flows, as well as on the Risk Based Capital of our insurance company subsidiaries that held equity security investments. Such actions will also mitigate fluctuations in net income associated with non-cash earnings from net gains (losses) from the change in fair value of equity securities.\nWe believe we are well positioned to address the increasing need for savings tools and income protection. We believe our overall financial strength and broad distribution channels position us to respond with a variety of products for individuals approaching retirement age, who seek information to plan for and manage their retirement needs. We believe our products that offer guaranteed income flows are well suited to serve this market.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nThe increase in earnings was partially offset by the following:\n\u2022A favorable change in investment credit loss due to improvement in our commercial mortgage loans driven by improvement in cash flows and a positive economic outlook from our properties, and improving conditions in travel and leisure\n\nMerger Agreement's Restrictions on Interim Operations. The Company has agreed to certain covenants in the Merger Agreement restricting the conduct of its business between the date of the Merger Agreement and the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of the Merger Agreement. The general effect of these covenants is that, during such interim period, the Company will be limited in its ability to pursue strategic and operational matters outside the ordinary course of business. The Company has agreed that it and its subsidiaries will conduct their business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice in all material respects and use reasonable best efforts to preserve their business organizations, goodwill and assets, keep available the services of their current key officers and employees, and preserve their present relationships with governmental entities and other key third parties, including customers, reinsurers, distributors, suppliers and other persons with whom the Company and its subsidiaries have business relationships.\nSince our estimate for the allowance for credit losses relies on management judgment and is sensitive to factors outside of our control, as noted above, there are inherent uncertainties within the estimates. As a result, the changes in the allowance for credit losses could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nWe offer our personal and commercial property and casualty lines of business primarily through our multiple line agencies. We favor a balanced, focused and collaborative approach to both growth and profitability through the development of successful agencies.\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands):\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2021 to 2020\nWe use multiple reinsurers with each reinsurer absorbing part of the overall risk ceded.

The two major categories of CAE are defense and cost containment expense, and adjusting and other expense. The details of property and casualty liability for unpaid claims are shown below (in thousands):\nMedicare Supplement claims decreased driven by policy lapses. In addition, claims experience for our Medical Expense, MGU and Supplemental health lines of business improved but was partially offset by an increase in short-term disability claims from our Worksite line of business.\nThe following table summarizes changes in the Life segment's in-force amounts (in thousands):\nWe have consistently paid dividends to our stockholders and expect to continue this tradition in the foreseeable future. There are no other known trends or uncertainties regarding product pricing, changes in product lines or rising costs that are expected to have a significant impact to cash flows from operations, although uncertainties relating to the COVID-19 pandemic could still significantly impact one or more of these items.\nThe Aggregate Property Catastrophe Excess cover provides for $30.0 million of limit excess of $160.0 million of aggregated catastrophe losses. Qualifying losses include amounts of retained losses net of other reinsurance below $35.0 million on Property Claims Services ( PCS\u201d) declared catastrophe events and internally declared catastrophe events exceeding $5.0 million.

See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6, Real Estate and Other Investments, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.\nWe believe the estimates used in our DAC calculations provide insight into how variations in assumptions and estimates would affect our business. The following table displays the sensitivity of reasonably likely changes in assumptions in the DAC amortization for our long-duration business at December 31, 2021 (in thousands):\n\nHealth claims incurred for the periods indicated were as follows (in thousands):\n\n\nOur cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment position increased from $1.4 billion at December 31, 2020 to $3.8 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase primarily relates to the fourth quarter 2021 sale of a majority of the Company's equity securities portfolio which resulted in an excess cash position. We intend to reinvest the cash proceeds consistent with our investment guidelines during 2022.\nFor 2021, the companies to which we have ceded reinsurance for the Health segment are shown below (in thousands, except percentages):\n\u2022An increase in net gains on equity securities due to more favorable market conditions in 2021 compared to the negative impact from the pandemic in 2020 on the fair value of our equity securities\n\u2022No significant prospective changes in laws that would significantly affect future payouts.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nEarnings for our Life segment decreased primarily due to the following:\nLife and Annuity\n\u2022No unusual growth patterns or unexpected changes in the mix of business; and\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nProducts\nWe reinsure a portion of the risks that we underwrite to manage our loss exposure. In return for ceded premiums, reinsurers assume a portion of the claims incurred. In addition to our reinsurance coverage, we are partially protected by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 and its predecessors. We participate in the National Flood Insurance Program administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs (DAC)\nCOVID-19 Response\nPremium Deficiency Reserve-Deficiency reserves are recorded when the expected claims payments and policy maintenance costs for a product line exceed the expected premiums for that product line. The estimation of a deficiency reserve considers the current profitability of a product line using anticipated claims, CAE, and policy maintenance costs. The assumptions and methods used to determine the need for deficiency reserves are reviewed periodically for reasonableness. There were no reserves of this type at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\nShort-Term Investments-Short-term investments are primarily commercial paper rated A2 or P2 or better by Standard & Poor's and Moody's, respectively. The amount fluctuates depending on our view of the desirability of investing in the available long-term investment opportunities and our liquidity needs, including mortgage investment-funding commitments.\nThe primary use of cash has been and is expected to continue to be payment of policyholder benefits and claims incurred. Current and expected patterns of claim frequency and severity may change from period to period but continue to be within historical norms. Management considers our current liquidity position to be sufficient to meet anticipated demands over the next twelve months.\nIn addition, reinsurance is used in the credit life business primarily to provide producers of credit-related insurance products the opportunity to participate in the underwriting risk through producer-owned captive reinsurance companies often domiciled outside of the United States. A majority of the treaties entered into by our Specialty Markets Group are written on a 100% coinsurance basis with benefit limits of $0.1 million on credit life.\nITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nCase Reserves-Reserves for reported losses are determined on either a judgment or a formula basis, depending on the timing and type of the loss. The formula reserve is a fixed amount for each claim of a given type based on historical paid loss data for similar claims with a provision for claim inflation. Judgment reserve amounts replace initial formula reserves and are set for each loss based on facts and circumstances of each case and the expectation of damages. We regularly monitor the adequacy of reserves on a case-by-case basis and change the amount of such reserves as necessary.\n\n\u2022the outcome of any legal proceedings initiated against the Company or Brookfield Reinsurance following the announcement of the Proposed Transaction could adversely affect the Company or Brookfield Reinsurance, including their ability to consummate the Proposed Transaction; and\nWe are currently evaluating the renovation and modernization of our home office facilities. This could result in capital expenditures that could aggregate to approximately $100.0 million over a three-year period; however, current uncertainties relating to the COVID-19 pandemic have caused us to delay this project at this time. There are no other unusually large capital expenditures expected in the next 12-24 months.\n\u2022make or authorize capital expenditures that are, on an individual basis, in excess of\u2009110% of the Company's capital expenditure budget or in excess of 105% of the aggregate capital expenditure budget, except for (i) planned capital expenditures disclosed to Brookfield Reinsurance at signing of the Merger Agreement and (ii) reasonable emergency capital expenditures (after consultation with Brookfield Reinsurance) necessary to maintain its ability to operate its businesses in the ordinary course or for the safety of individuals, assets or the environment;\n\u2022Bornhuetter-Ferguson-This method uses, as a starting point, either an assumed Initial Expected Loss Ratio Method or Pegged Frequency and Severity method and blends in the loss ratio or frequency and severity implied by the claims experience to date by using loss development patterns based on our historical experience.

Best rating as of the most current information available February 9, 2022.\nIn April 2020, the Company borrowed $500 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas' COVID-19 Relief Advance Program. As of December 31, 2021, there are no advances outstanding; the final advance was repaid on its maturity date of April 28, 2021. The available liquidity at February 9, 2022 was approximately $879.3 million.\nFuture Policy Benefits\n\n*Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13. Adoption of this guidance resulted in an allowance for credit losses primarily on our commercial mortgage loans and related off-balance sheet unfunded loan commitments, held-to-maturity bonds and reinsurance recoverables. The results for 2019 have not been restated to conform to the current presentation.\nTotal Life sales increased 9.2% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020 as new life sales rebounded from the COVID-19 economic uncertainties and social distancing practices during 2020.\nBased on information currently available, we believe that amounts ultimately paid, if any, arising from existing and currently potential litigation would not have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. However, it should be noted that the frequency of large damage awards, which bear little or no relation to the economic damages incurred by plaintiffs, continues to create the potential for an unpredictable judgment in any given lawsuit. It is possible that, if the defenses in these lawsuits are not successful, and the judgments are greater than we anticipate, the resulting liability could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nRegulatory Approval Process. The completion of the Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the Merger\u201d) is subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions, including obtaining the required regulatory approval from the insurance authorities in Texas, Missouri, New York, Louisiana and California. The required insurance regulatory process has been moving forward consistent with our prior disclosures, and we continue to expect to complete the Merger before the end of the first half of 2022. However, because state insurance regulatory approval remains outstanding, the Company cannot provide assurance the Merger will be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all.\n\u2022The increase in commissions was primarily attributable to an increase in premiums written for our specialty markets products. The growth in specialty markets products was also the primary driver for the increase in operating expenses and the deferral of policy acquisition expenses outpacing amortization\n\u2022The expected loss ratios, claim frequency and severity, estimated primarily using our historical loss experience;\n\u2022A decrease in Life segment earnings driven by an overall increase in mortality which includes claims directly and indirectly attributable to COVID-19\nPolicy lapses as a result of rate increases drove a decrease in premiums for Medicare Supplement during 2021. In addition, Supplemental insurance premiums decreased due to a reduction in sales across all product lines, primarily in short-term medical.\nITEM 7.

Policy credits were $0.9 million for commercial automobile policies in 2020\nLow interest rates are also challenging for property and casualty insurers. Investment income is an important element in earning an acceptable return on capital. Lower interest rates resulting in lower investment income require us to achieve better underwriting results. We have adjusted policy prices to help mitigate the adverse impact of low interest rates on our property and casualty business.\nCommercial Automobile: Net premiums written and earned increased primarily due to rate increases. The loss and loss adjustment expense and combined ratios improved primarily due to favorable prior year claim development and rate increases.\n\u2022Management judgment is required to determine which models, methodologies, and scenario conditions are used to calculate the allowance for credit losses to produce a reasonable estimate that encompasses the expected lifetime credit losses.\n\u2022We have developed and are continually refining our return-to-office plans for our locations. Beginning in June 2021, we gradually re-introduced more employees to our office locations but had to lessen our in-office presence in the latter part of the year due to a surge in the Omicron variant. We are continually monitoring the situation with a longer-term plan to offer employees hybrid work schedules, where possible.\n\u2022subject to certain limited exceptions, sell, lease, license, transfer, pledge, subject to any encumbrance or otherwise dispose of any of its or their assets or properties;\nOur contractual obligations are not expected to have a significant negative impact to cash flows from operations. American National has agreed to pay our financial advisor in connection with the Merger, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (\"Citi\"), for its Merger-related services an aggregate fee of $40.0 million, of which $3.0 million was paid upon delivery of Citi's fairness opinion related to the Merger entered into on August 6, 2021 and the remaining $37.0 million is payable contingent upon consummation of the Merger, which has not been reflected in the consolidated statement of operations. In addition, the Company agreed to reimburse Citi for expenses, including fees and expenses of counsel, and to indemnify Citi and related parties against certain liabilities, including liabilities under federal securities laws, arising from Citi's engagement.\n\u2022An increase in net investment income due to higher option gains resulting from favorable market conditions\n\u2022Consistent claims handling, reserving and payment processes;\n(1)A.M. Best rating as of the most current information available February 9, 2022.\nInterest and Mortality Margin\nEarnings for our Property and Casualty segment decreased primarily due to the following:\n(1)Refer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for explanation of prior year retrospective adjustment\nAnnuity Reserving-Reserves for payout annuities with more than insignificant amounts of mortality risk are calculated in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for limited pay insurance contracts. Benefit and maintenance expense reserves are calculated by using assumptions reflecting our expectations of future costs, including an appropriate margin for adverse deviation. These assumptions are locked-in at issue and generally reflect pricing assumptions from that period. If the resulting reserve would otherwise cause profits to be recognized at the issue date, additional reserves are recorded. The resulting recognition of profits would be gradual over the expected life of the contract.\nCompetitive Pressures: In recent years, the competitive landscape of the U.S. life insurance industry has shifted. Established insurers are competing against each other and also against new market entrants that are developing products to attract the interest of the growing number of retirees. Competition exists in terms of retaining and acquiring consumers' business and also in terms of access to producers and distributors. Consolidation among distributors coupled with the aging sales force remains a challenge among insurers. In addition, the increased technological sophistication of consumers necessitates that insurers and distributors invest significant resources in technology to adapt to consumer expectations. We believe we possess sufficient scale, financial strength, resources and flexibility to compete effectively.\nThis MD&A should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n\n\nWe have decided to exit the Medicare Supplement market due to increasing pricing pressures and deterioration of new sales and operational performance. Marketing efforts are refocused to MGU, Worksite and Individual Supplemental lines of business.\nPolicy Loans-For certain life insurance products, policyholders may borrow funds using the policy's cash value as collateral. The maximum amount of the policy loan depends upon the policy's surrender value. As of December 31, 2021, we had $365.2 million in policy loans with a loan to surrender value of approximately 54%, and at December 31, 2020, we had $373.0 million in policy loans with a loan to surrender value of approximately 56%. Interest rates on policy loans primarily range from 3.0% to 12.0% per annum. Policy loans may be repaid at any time by the policyholder and have priority to any claims on the policy. If the policyholder fails to repay the policy loan, funds are withdrawn from the policy's benefits.\nEarnings for our Corporate and Other segment increased primarily due to the following:\nChanging Regulatory Environment: The insurance industry is primarily regulated at the state level, although some life and annuity products and services are also subject to U.S. federal regulation. We are regularly subjected to additional or changing regulation that requires us to update systems, change product structure, increase the amount of reporting or adopt changes to distribution. These changes may increase the capital requirements for us and the industry, increase operating costs, change our operating practices and change our ability to provide products with pricing attractive to the marketplace.\nThe changes in our capital resources are summarized below (in thousands):\nFor 2021, the companies to whom we have ceded reinsurance for the Life segment are shown below (in thousands, except percentages):\n\u2022Loss or Expense Development (Chain Ladder)-This method uses actual loss or defense and cost containment expense data and the historical development profiles on older accident periods to project more recent, less developed periods to their ultimate total. This method is appropriate when there is a relatively stable pattern of loss and expense emergence and a relatively large number of reported claims.\nTo acquire and retain profitable business, we use sophisticated pricing models and risk segmentation, along with a focused distribution force. We believe this approach allows us to make product enhancements and offer programs that are charging an appropriate premium for the risk.\nLife and Annuity Liability for Unpaid Claims\nCorporate and Other segment financial results for the periods indicated were as follows (in thousands):\nAdditional Information:\nWorkers Compensation: The loss and loss adjustment expense and combined ratios increased primarily due to an increase in claim severity.\nThe Company sells equity-indexed universal life and equity-indexed deferred annuity contracts with guaranteed minimum benefits, some of which contain embedded derivatives that are required to be bifurcated from a host reserve, separately accounted for, and measured at fair value. We utilize over-the-counter equity options to hedge our exposure to equity-indexed universal life and equity-indexed deferred annuity benefits, and the fair values for these options are sourced from broker quotations. Accounting guidance requires a fair value calculation as part of equity-indexed policy reserves. This is called the value of embedded derivative (\"VED\") and the other part of the indexed policy reserve is called the host reserve. The embedded derivative represents future benefit cash flows in excess of the minimum guarantee cash flows. The host covers the minimum guarantee cash flows. Both the VED and the host reserve are calculated by a vendor-sourced reserve valuation system. The VED calculation model incorporates assumptions related to current option pricing (such as implied volatility and interest rates), future policyholder behavior (such as surrenders and withdrawals), and factors affecting the value of future indexed interest periods (such as option budgets). These assumptions are evaluated annually by management with any changes in the estimated fair value resulting in a cumulative charge or credit to income from operations.\n\u2022events, changes or other circumstances could occur that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement;\nHealth\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nITEM 7.

Our subsidiaries may obtain additional statutory capital through various sources, such as retained statutory earnings or equity contributions from us.\nThe Property Catastrophe Top and Drop cover consists of $30.0 million of annual limit available either wholly or in part across two layers of coverage. The first layer is 100% of $30.0 million excess of $470.0 million on an occurrence basis. The second layer provides aggregate protection where subject loss is $15.0 million excess of $20.0 million of each catastrophe, and recoveries follow satisfaction of a $15.0 million annual aggregate deductible. The second layer acts to reduce the retention on large second and third catastrophe events to $20.0 million following a first large catastrophe. This cover was placed at 100% for 2021 and does not include a reinstatement.\nHomeowners: Net premiums written and earned increased primarily due to rate increases.\n(1)Life and annuity obligations include undiscounted estimated claim, benefit, surrender and commission obligations offset by expected future premiums and deposits on in-force insurance policies and annuity contracts. All amounts are gross of any reinsurance recoverable. Estimated claim, benefit and surrender obligations are based on mortality and lapse assumptions comparable with historical experience. Estimated payments on interest-sensitive life and annuity obligations include interest credited to those products. The interest crediting rates are derived by deducting current product spreads from a constant investment yield. As a result, the estimated obligations for insurance liabilities included in the table exceed the liabilities recorded in the liability for future policy benefits and policy and contract claims. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the amounts presented could materially differ from actual payments. Separate account obligations have not been included in the table since those obligations are not part of the general account obligations and will be funded by cash flows from separate account assets. The general account obligations for insurance liabilities will be funded by cash flows from general account assets and future premiums and deposits. Participating policyholder dividends payable consists of liabilities related to dividends payable in the following calendar year and are presented in the less than one-year category. All estimated cash payments are net of estimated future premiums on policies currently in-force net of future policyholder dividends payable. The participating policyholders' share obligation included in other policyholder funds and the timing and amount of the ultimate participating policyholder obligation is subject to significant uncertainty and the amount of the participating policyholder obligation is based upon a long-term projection of the performance of the participating policy block.\n\n\u2022the announcement or pendency of the Proposed Transaction could affect the relationships of the Company or Brookfield Reinsurance with its clients, and operating results and business generally, including on our ability to retain and attract employees;\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has devoted key resources to make employee health and safety a top priority. These efforts are having a positive impact as reflected in recent employee engagement survey results. Additionally, as we speak with candidates during the talent acquisition process, our precautions and protocols to ensure employee safety have been important to them when making the decision to join us. As we proceed though the pandemic, employee safety, productivity and retention are vital to meeting business goals and objectives.\nThe Corporate and Other segment acts as the owner of all invested assets of the Company. The investment income from the invested assets is allocated to the insurance segments in accordance with the assets allocated to each insurance segment. Earnings of the Corporate and Other segment are derived from income related to invested assets not allocated to the insurance segments and from our non-insurance subsidiaries.

The change in amortization of DAC includes the unlocking of assumptions to our equity-indexed annuities largely offset by the effects of increases in interest rates, and as mentioned above, the change in estimate related to our equity-indexed annuities resulted in a $26.3 million increase in the amortization of DAC in 2020.\nITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\n\u2022 An increase in operating expenses primarily due to Merger-related expenses of $21.5 million\nProperty and Casualty Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses\nSale of Equity Securities Portfolio\nAs a result of the economic impact associated with COVID-19, American National modified 93 mortgage loans with a total balance of $1.6 billion during 2020. These modifications were in the form of forbearance of principal and interest payments for up to six months, extensions of maturity dates, and/or provisions for interest only payments. The modifications were primarily related to our loans to hotels, retail and parking operations. Due to the ongoing economic stress brought on by the pandemic, additional modifications for 33 of these loans with a total balance of $725.7 million were made during 2021. These additional modifications extended the forbearance of principal and interest payments and interest only provisions with a requirement for the payment of at least 20% of the total interest due during the extended modification period. The modified loans had an aggregate deferred interest of $5.6 million as of December 31, 2021. There are no commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose loans have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring during the periods presented. The decrease in loans determined to be a troubled debt restructuring during 2021 is primarily attributable to improved economic conditions after lifting of COVID-19 related restrictions.\nSpecialty Markets Products\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted ASC 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, accounting guidance related to the allowance for credit losses. The new standard significantly changed how entities measure credit losses for most financial assets and reinsurance recoverables that are not measured at fair value through net income. The guidance replaced the current incurred loss\u201d approach with an expected loss\u201d model for instruments measured at amortized cost. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4, Investment in Securities, and Note 5, Mortgage Loans, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the accounting policies and methodologies for establishing the allowance for credit losses.\nThe fair value of available-for-sale fixed maturity and equity securities is determined by management using one of the three primary sources of information: the quoted prices in active markets, third-party pricing services, or independent broker quotations. Estimated fair value of securities based on quoted prices in active markets is readily and regularly available; therefore, valuation of these securities generally does not involve management judgment. For securities without quoted prices, fair value measurement is determined using third-party pricing services' proprietary pricing applications. Typical inputs used by the models are relevant market information, benchmark curves, benchmark pricing of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing. Any securities remaining unpriced after utilizing the first two pricing methods are submitted to independent brokers for prices. We have analyzed the third-party pricing services and independent brokers' valuation methodologies and related inputs, and have evaluated the various types of securities in our investment portfolio to determine an appropriate fair value hierarchy level based upon trading activity and the observability of market inputs. Management completes certain tests throughout the year and at year-end to determine that prices provided by our pricing services are reasonable.\nOur capital resources are summarized below (in thousands):\nHealth liabilities for unpaid claims are established using the following methods:\nOur defined benefit plans are frozen and currently adequately funded; however, low interest rates, increased longevity of participants, and rising Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ( PBGC\u201d) premiums may cause us to increase our funding of the plans.\nLiquidity\n\nStatutory Capital and Surplus and Risk-based Capital\n\u2022there are risks related to disruption of management's attention from the ongoing business operations of the Company or Brookfield Reinsurance due to the Proposed Transaction;\nStatutory capital and surplus is the capital of our insurance companies reported in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the applicable state insurance departments. RBC is calculated using formulas applied to certain financial balances and activities that consider, among other things, investment risks related to the type and quality of investments, insurance risks associated with products and liabilities, interest rate risks and general business risks. Insurance companies that do not maintain capital and surplus at a level of at least 100% of the company action level RBC are required to take certain actions. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, ANICO's statutory capital and surplus was $4.0 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. ANICO and each of our insurance subsidiaries had statutory capital and surplus at December 31, 2021 and 2020 above 200% of the company action level except ANPAC Louisiana Insurance Company (\"ANPLA\"), which had an RBC level of 194% at December 31, 2020, which increased to 242% at December 31, 2021.\nAgricultural Business: Our agricultural business product allows policyholders to customize and cover their agriculture exposure using a package policy, which includes coverage for residences and household contents, farm and ranch buildings and building contents, personal and commercial liability and personal property. Net premiums written and earned increased primarily due to increases in policies in-force and rate increases.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThis MD&A should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. For comparison of 2020 to 2019, see Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 4, 2021.\nHealth\nAmerican National Group, Inc. (\"ANAT\") is a family of companies that has $31.3 billion in assets, $24.3 billion in liabilities and $7.0 billion in stockholders' equity as of December 31, 2021. American National Insurance Company (\"ANICO\"), founded in 1905 and headquartered in Galveston, Texas, and other ANAT subsidiaries offer a broad spectrum of products and services, which include life insurance, annuities, property and casualty insurance, health insurance, credit insurance, and pension products. The American National companies operate in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. In addition to ANICO, major subsidiaries include American National Life Insurance Company of Texas, American National Life Insurance Company of New York, American National Property and Casualty Company, Garden State Life Insurance Company, Standard Life and Accident Insurance Company, Farm Family Casualty Insurance Company and United Farm Family Insurance Company.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nThe Merger Agreement permits the Company to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends not to exceed $0.82 per share of common stock prior to completion of the Merger.\n(1)A negative change indicates more expense was deferred than amortized and represents a decrease to expenses in the period indicated.\nLife Reserving-Principal assumptions used in the determination of the reserves for future policy benefits are mortality, policy lapse rates, investment return, inflation, expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type. Reserves for incurred but not reported ( IBNR\u201d) claims on life policies are calculated using historical claims information. Reserves for interest-sensitive and variable universal life insurance policies are equal to the current account value calculated for the policyholder. Some of our universal life policies contain secondary guarantees, for which additional reserves are recorded based on the term of the policy.\nImportance of Operating Efficiencies: The volatile economic environment and costs associated with greater regulation create a further need for operating efficiencies. We manage our cost base while maintaining our commitment to provide superior customer service to policyholders and agents. Investments in technology are coordinated through a disciplined project management process. We anticipate continuous improvement in our use of technology to enhance our policyholders' and agents' experience and increase our overall operating effectiveness.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations are materially affected by economic and financial market conditions. The U.S. and global economies, as well as the capital markets, continue to show mixed signals, and uncertainties continue to be significant factors in the markets in which we operate. Factors such as consumer spending, business investment, the volatility of the capital markets, the level of interest rates, unemployment, the level of participation in the workforce and the risk of inflation or deflation will affect the business and economic environment and, in turn, impact the demand for the type of financial and insurance products we offer. Adverse changes in the economy could have a material adverse effect on us. However, we believe those risks are somewhat mitigated by our financial strength, active enterprise risk management and disciplined underwriting for our products. Our diverse product mix and distribution channels across insurance segments is a strength that we expect will help us adapt to the volatile economic environment and give us the ability to serve the changing needs of our customers. Additionally, through our long-term business approach, we believe we are financially strong, and we are committed to providing a steady and reliable source of financial protection for policyholders.\nWe have various agency, consulting and service arrangements with individuals and entities considered to be related parties. Each of these arrangements has been reviewed and approved by our Audit Committee, which retains final decision-making authority for these transactions. The amounts involved, both individually and in the aggregate, with these arrangements are not material to any segment or to our overall operations. For additional details see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 20, Related Party Transactions, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\u2022Ratio of Paid Defense and Cost Containment Expense to Paid Loss Development-This method uses the ratio of paid defense and cost containment expense to paid loss data and the historical development profiles on older accident periods to project more recent, less developed periods to their ultimate total. In this method, an ultimate ratio of paid defense and cost containment expense to paid loss is selected for each accident period. The selected paid defense and cost containment expense to paid loss ratio is then applied to the selected ultimate loss for each accident period to estimate the ultimate defense and cost containment expense. Paid defense and cost containment expense is then subtracted from the ultimate defense and cost containment expense to calculate the unpaid defense and cost containment expense for that accident period.\nReserve Development\n\u2022regulatory approvals required for the Proposed Transaction may not be obtained, or required regulatory approvals may delay the Proposed Transaction or result in the imposition of conditions that could have a material adverse effect on the Company or Brookfield Reinsurance or cause certain conditions to closing not to be satisfied, which could result in the termination of the Merger Agreement;\nWe had a DAC asset of approximately $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Net premiums written and earned increased due to rate increases in the rental owners product. The loss and loss adjustment expense and combined ratios improved due to fewer non-catastrophe losses.\nThe evaluation process to determine liability for unpaid claims involves the collaboration of underwriting, claims and actuarial departments. The process also includes consultation with independent actuarial firms as part of our process of gaining reassurance that claims and CAE liability estimate sufficiently, all obligations arising from all losses incurred as of year-end.\nFunds received as premium payments and deposits that are not used for liquidity requirements are generally invested in bonds and commercial mortgages. Funds are invested with the intent that income from the investments and proceeds from the maturities will meet our ongoing cash flow needs. We historically have not had to liquidate invested assets in order to cover cash flow needs. We believe our portfolio of highly liquid bonds and available-for-sale investment securities coupled with our ability to borrow funds through the FHLB, are sufficient to meet future liquidity needs as necessary.\n\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2021 to 2020\nLitigation Contingencies\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2021 to 2020\nA description of these critical accounting estimates is presented below.

Generally, mortgage loans are secured by first liens on income-producing real estate with a loan-to-value ratio of up to 75%. Mortgage loans are generally carried at outstanding principal balances, adjusted for any unamortized premium or discount, deferred fees or expenses, and net of allowances. The weighted average coupon yield on the principal funded for mortgage loans was 4.6% and 4.8% at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For additional information regarding mortgage loans refer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5, Mortgage Loans, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nITEM 7.

Our estimate is highly dependent on actuarial and management judgment as to which method(s) is most appropriate for a particular accident year and class of business. Our methodology changes over time, as new information emerges regarding underlying loss activity and other factors.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2021 to 2020\nThe decrease in earnings was partially offset by the following:\nThe decrease in earnings was partially offset primarily due to the following:\nBonds-We allocate most of our fixed maturity securities to support our insurance business. At December 31, 2021, our fixed maturity securities had an estimated fair value of $15.8 billion, which was $0.6 billion, or 4.2%, above amortized cost. At December 31, 2020, our fixed maturity securities had an estimated fair value of $15.6 billion, which was $1.2 billion, or 8.0%, above amortized cost. Unrealized gains decreased on our fixed maturity due to an increase in benchmark ten-year interest rates. For additional information regarding unrealized gains and losses, refer to Part II, Item 7, Investments, Net Unrealized Gains and Losses table. The estimated fair value for securities due in one year or less was $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2021 and $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2020. For additional information regarding total bonds by credit quality rating, refer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4, Investments in Securities, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nProperty and Casualty segment financial results for the periods indicated were as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nThe decrease in our total investments at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 was a result of a decrease in held-to-maturity bonds and the sale of equity securities which caused a temporary increase in cash which we intend to reinvest.\nThe property and casualty liabilities for unpaid claims are established to recognize future development on reported losses for each line of business. The estimation of these amounts is subject to significant uncertainty due to the volatile nature of property and casualty insurance liabilities. The estimation process is based significantly on the assumption that past developments are an appropriate predictor of future events and involves a variety of actuarial techniques that analyze experience, trends and other relevant factors. See the following paragraphs as well as Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 12, Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\u2022amend or propose to amend the Company's or its subsidiaries' certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other comparable organizational documents, in each case, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise;\nThe increase in earnings was partially offset by the following:\nWe also utilize reinsurance in our credit health business. In certain cases, we may also reinsure the policy written through non-U.S. producer-owned captive reinsurers to allow the dealer to participate in the performance of these credit health contracts. A majority of the treaties entered into by our Specialty Markets Group are written on a 100% coinsurance basis with benefit limits of $1,000 per month.\n\nEquity Securities-We have invested in the equity securities of companies traded on national U.S. stock exchanges. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4, Investments in Securities, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the unrealized and realized gains and losses of equity securities. The Company sold the majority of its equity securities portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2021. For additional information regarding the Sale of Equity Securities Portfolio, see General Trends above.\nMargins decreased for fixed annuities over the past two years due to declining portfolio rates and increased for indexed annuities in 2020 due to the aforementioned change in estimate. The increased margin for indexed annuities was sustained in 2021 due to the favorable impact of increases in treasury rates on mark-to-market reserves. The following table summarizes the interest margin due to the impact of the investment performance, interest credited to policyholder's account balances, and the end of period assets measured by account balance (in thousands):\nEarnings for our Annuity segment increased primarily due to the following:\nITEM 7.

The Company does not currently intend to sell nor does it expect to be required to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position.\nCompletion Factor Approach-This method assumes that the historical claim patterns will be an accurate representation of unpaid claim liabilities. An estimate of the unpaid claims is calculated by subtracting period-to-date paid claims from an estimate of the ultimate complete\u201d payment for all incurred claims in the period. Completion factors are calculated which complete\u201d the current period-to-date payment totals for each incurred month to estimate the ultimate expected payout.\n\u2022A reduction in premiums and an increase in DAC amortization driven by policy lapses in our Medicare Supplement line of business\nReal Estate and Real Estate Partnerships-We invest in commercial real estate where positive cash flows and/or appreciation in value is expected. Real estate may be owned directly by our insurance companies or non-insurance affiliates or indirectly in joint ventures with real estate developers or investors we determine share our perspective regarding risk and return relationships. The carrying value of real estate is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairments, if any. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the properties. The carrying value of our real estate partnerships is determined by using the equity method of accounting.\nProperty and Casualty Reserving Methodology-The following methods are utilized:\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nNet Unrealized Gains and Losses\nValuation of Financial Instruments\nNet investment income increased $195.5 million during 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher gains on options, an increase in investment income from investment funds and mortgage loan prepayment and profit participation income.\nThe decrease in earnings was partially offset by the following:\nOur insurance and annuity products are generally supported by investment-grade bonds and commercial mortgage loans. We also invest in equity options as a hedge for our indexed products. We purchase fixed maturity securities and designate them as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale considering our estimated future cash flow needs. We also monitor the composition of our fixed maturity securities classified as held-to-maturity and available-for-sale and adjust the mix within the portfolio as investments mature or new investments are purchased.\nManagement believes our reserves at December 31, 2021 are adequate. New information, regulation, events or circumstances unknown at the original valuation date, however, may result in future development resulting in ultimate losses being significantly greater or less than the recorded reserves at December 31, 2021.\nWhile we believe that our claims reserves at December 31, 2021 are adequate, new information, events or circumstances, unknown at the original valuation date, may lead to future developments in ultimate losses in amounts significantly greater or less than the reserves currently recorded. The actual final cost of settling both claims outstanding at December 31, 2021 and claims expected to arise from unexpired periods of risk is uncertain. There are many other possible changes that would cause losses to increase or decrease, which include but are not limited to claim severity; the expected level of reported claims; judicial action changing the scope or liability of coverage; the regulatory, social and economic environment; and unexpected changes in loss inflation. For additional information regarding prior year development of our claims and CAE reserves, refer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 12, Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nContinued Challenges of Talent Attraction and Retention: Attracting qualified individuals and retaining existing employees continues to be a challenge for employers. Businesses have become extremely competitive in the ever-changing landscape of the talent marketplace. As a result, it is an increasing challenge to distinguish us as an employer of choice.\n(1)A negative change indicates more expense was deferred than amortized and represents a decrease to expenses in the period indicated.\nOn August 6, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) with Brookfield Asset Management Reinsurance Partners Ltd. ( Brookfield Reinsurance\u201d), an exempted company limited by shares existing under the laws of Bermuda, and Freestone Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Brookfield Reinsurance ( Merger Sub\u201d). Upon completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Company will become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Brookfield Reinsurance in consideration for the payment of $190.00 per share in cash, for total merger consideration of $5.1 billion.\n(1)A negative change indicates more expense was deferred than amortized and represents a decrease to expenses in the period indicated.\nCommercial Products results for the periods indicated were as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\n\u2022terminate, amend, modify, assign or waive any material right under any material contract or reinsurance contract except in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.\n(1)Weighted amounts with single and excess premiums counted at 10%\nOther Invested Assets-Other invested assets are comprised primarily of pooled loans to mid-sized businesses which are initiated and administered by third-party managers and are carried at fair value. Other invested assets also include equity-indexed options, carried at fair value, net of collateral provided by counterparties; such collateral is restricted to the Company's use. Additionally, other invested assets include FHLB capital stock, mineral rights, mezzanine loans and lease financing arrangements, all of which are carried at cost.\nInvestment Funds-Our investment funds are primarily comprised of senior secured and second lien private loans that are secured by assets, revenues and credit/balance sheet lending. We recognize our share of fund earnings in net investment income on a one-quarter lag under the equity method of accounting. Cash distributions are received from fund earnings and from liquidation of underlying investments.\nReinsurance\nFor traditional business, a lock-in\u201d principle applies, whereby the assumptions used to calculate the benefit reserves and DAC are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience. These include margins for adverse deviation in the event that actual experience differs from the original assumptions.\n\nA downgrade or a potential downgrade in our financial strength ratings could result in a loss of business and could adversely affect our cash flows from operations. A.M. Best has placed American National's issuer credit and financial strength ratings under review with developing implications and S&P Global Ratings has placed the ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications of which are due to the pending Merger with Brookfield Reinsurance.\nInterest Rates: The low-interest rate environment is a challenge for life and annuity insurers as the spreads on deposit-type contracts remain narrow, especially as interest rates have approached minimum crediting rates. Low market interest rates reduce the spreads between the amounts we credit to fixed annuity and individual life policyholders and the amounts we earn on the investments that support these obligations. Our ALM Committee actively manages the profitability of these blocks of business. In previous years, we reduced the guaranteed minimum crediting rates on new fixed annuity contracts, which has afforded us the flexibility to respond to the unusually low-interest rate environment. We have also reduced crediting rates on in-force contracts, where permitted to do so. These actions help mitigate the adverse impact of low interest rates on the profitability of these products, although sales volume may be negatively impacted as a result. We also maintain assets with various maturities to support product liabilities and ensure liquidity. A gradual increase in longer-term interest rates relative to short-term rates generally will have a favorable effect on the profitability of our products. Rapidly rising interest rates could result in reduced persistency of our spread-based products, if contract holders shift assets into higher yielding investments. We believe our ability to react quickly to the changing marketplace will help us manage this risk.\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that often involve a significant degree of judgment. These estimates and judgments include expectations of current and future mortality, morbidity, persistency, claims and claim adjustment expenses, recoverability of receivables, investment returns and interest rates which extend well into the future. In developing these estimates there is inherent uncertainty, and material changes to facts and circumstances may develop. Although variability is inherent in these estimates, we believe the amounts as reported are appropriate based upon the facts available upon compilation of the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022conditions to the closing of the Proposed Transaction may not be satisfied;\nChange in Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs\n\u2022A favorable change in investment credit loss due to improvement in our commercial mortgage loans driven by improvement in cash flows and a positive economic outlook from our properties, and improving conditions in travel and leisure\nEach per-event coverage above includes one automatic reinstatement except for a 12.5% portion of the Corporate Program (12.5% of $35.0 million to $470.0 million). The automatic reinstatement requires us to pay additional reinsurance premium for any losses into each reinsurance layer. The reinstatement premium is prorated by the percentage of actual loss to the coverage, with the exception of 47.5% of losses from $35.0 million to $100.0 million, that reflects a 50% reduction on the prorated amount. The 12.5% placement of non-reinstateable coverage reduces the amount of reinstatement premium we are obligated to pay.\n\n\nThe following sets forth the consolidated results of operations (in thousands):\n\u2022Improvement in the combined ratio for our commercial and specialty markets products\n\u2022We continue to take steps to protect employees with the goals of maintaining their health and sustaining an adequate workforce, including employees working from home and offering flexibility for employees negotiating scheduling conflicts due to the impacts of COVID-19, such as caring for family, alternative arrangements and shutdowns for business and schools, self-isolation or personal illness, including granting additional paid time off for vaccinations and to address these hardships.\n\nAnnuity premiums and deposits increased primarily for equity-indexed and fixed deferred products during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020 reflecting improved competitiveness of the product. The decrease in earned premium is due to a decline in single premium annuity sales.\nNet Investment Income and Net Realized Gains (Losses)\nCapital Resources\nThe above is a summary of certain material terms of the Merger Agreement and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which was filed as an exhibit to the Company's current report on Form 8-K filed on August 9, 2021.\nContractual Obligations\nOur insurance segments do not directly own assets. Rather, assets are allocated to support the liabilities and capital allocated to each segment. The mix of assets allocated to each of the insurance segments is intended to support the characteristics of the insurance liabilities within each segment including expected cash flows and pricing assumptions, and is intended to be sufficient to support each segment's business activities. We have utilized this methodology consistently over all periods presented.\nFuture Policy Benefits-Reserves are equal to the aggregate of the present value of expected future benefit payments, less the present value of expected future premiums. Morbidity and termination assumptions are based on our experience or published valuation tables when available and appropriate.\nHealth earned premiums for the periods indicated were as follows (in thousands):\n\u2022An increase in operating expenses primarily due to Merger-related expenses of $21.5 million\nKey Assumptions-The following assumptions reflect our best estimates and may impact our property and casualty reserves:\nLife insurance sales are based on the total yearly premium that insurance companies would expect to receive if all recurring premium policies remain in-force, plus 10% of single and excess premiums. Life insurance sales measure activity associated with gaining new insurance business in the current period, and includes deposits received related to interest sensitive life and universal life-type products. Whereas GAAP premium revenues are associated with policies sold in current and prior periods, and deposits received related to interest sensitive life and universal life-type products are recorded in a policyholder account which is reflected as a liability. Therefore, a reconciliation of premium revenues and insurance sales is not meaningful.\nWe believe we will continue to be competitive in the life and annuity markets through our broad line of products, diverse distribution channels, and consistent high level of customer service. We modify our products to meet customer needs and to expand our reach where we believe we can obtain profitable growth.\n(1)The Corporate Program covers all non-credit property and casualty business, subject to certain limits and is not specific to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any state or region.

Significantly lower future estimated profits may cause us to accelerate the amortization of DAC or require us to establish additional policyholder liabilities, thereby reducing earnings. We periodically review assumptions with respect to future earnings to ensure they remain appropriate considering the current interest rate environment.\nSpecialty markets products provide protection to borrowers and the creditors that extend credit to them. Products offer coverage against unpaid indebtedness as a result of death, disability, involuntary unemployment or untimely loss to the collateral securing a personal or mortgage loan. Specialty markets products also include renters, mortgage security, aviation, and private flood insurance.\nPersonal Products results for the periods indicated were as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nFor interest-sensitive business, best-estimate assumptions are updated to reflect observed changes based on experience studies and current economic conditions. We reflect the effect of such assumption changes in DAC and reserve balances accordingly. Due to the long-term nature of many of the liabilities, small changes in certain assumptions may cause large changes in profitability. In particular, changes in estimates of the future invested asset return have a large effect on the degree of reserve adequacy and DAC recoverability.\n\nThe change in DAC represents acquisition costs capitalized less the amortization of existing DAC, which is calculated in proportion to expected gross profits.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\n(3)Reflects estimated future claim payments for claims incurred based on mortality and morbidity assumptions that are consistent with historical claims experience. These are not discounted with interest and will exceed the liabilities recorded in reserves for future claim payment, which are discounted with interest. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the amounts presented could materially differ from actual payments.\nTabular Claims Reserves-This method is used to calculate the reserves for long-term care and disability income blocks of business. These reserves rely on published valuation continuance tables created using industry experience regarding assumptions of continued morbidity and subsequent recovery. Reserves are calculated by applying these continuance tables, along with appropriate company experience adjustments, to the stream of contractual benefit payments. These expected benefit payments are discounted at the required interest rate.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2021 to 2020\n\u2022Pegged Frequency and Severity-This method uses actual claims count data and emergence patterns of older accident periods to project the ultimate number of reported claims for a given accident year. A similar process projects the ultimate average severity per claim so that the product of the two projections results in a projection of ultimate loss for a given accident year.\nThe unrealized gains and losses of our fixed maturity securities investment portfolio are shown below (in thousands):\nLife segment financial results for the periods indicated were as follows (in thousands):\nWe cede or retrocede the majority of the premium and risk associated with our stop-loss and other MGU programs. We maintain reinsurance on a quota share basis for our long-term care and long-term disability income business.\nWe have off-balance sheet arrangements relating to third-party marketing operation bank loans as discussed in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We could be exposed to a liability for these loans, which are supported by the cash value of the underlying insurance contracts. The cash value of the life insurance policies is designed to always equal or exceed the balance of the loans. Accordingly, management does not foresee any material loss related to these arrangements.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\n\u2022The expected loss development patterns, estimated primarily using our historical loss experience;\nOn an ongoing basis, management reviews the estimates and assumptions used in preparing the financial statements. If current facts and circumstances warrant modifications in estimates and assumptions, our financial position and results of operations as reported in the consolidated financial statements could change significantly.\nDemand for property and casualty credit-related insurance products continues to increase. We continue to update credit-related insurance product offerings and pricing to meet changing market needs, as well as adding new agents to expand market share in the credit-related insurance market. We are reviewing and implementing procedures to enhance customer service while, simultaneously, looking for efficiencies to reduce administrative costs.\n\nThe following table summarizes changes in the Life segment's number of policies in-force:\nRecoverability-At least annually, we test the adequacy of the net benefit reserves (policy benefit reserves less DAC) recorded for life insurance and annuity products. To perform the tests, we use our current best-estimate assumptions as to policyholder mortality, persistency, maintenance expenses and invested asset returns.\nBusiness Owner: Our business owner product allows policyholders to customize and cover their property and liability exposures using a package policy. Net premiums written and earned increased primarily due to increases in policies in-force and rate increases. The loss and loss adjustment expense and combined ratios improved primarily due to more favorable claim development compared to prior year.\nOther Commercial: Other commercial products primarily provide umbrella and other liability coverages. Net premiums written and earned increased primarily due to an increase in premium for umbrella products. The loss and loss adjustment expense and combined ratios improved primarily due to favorable prior year claim development.\nIncreased Role of Advanced Technology: The use of mobile technology has changed the way consumers want to conduct their business, including real-time access to information. Many customers expect to complete transactions in a digital format instead of traditional methods that require a phone call or submission of paper forms. Social media and other customer-facing technologies also reshape the way companies communicate and collaborate with key stakeholders, and new tools exist to better collect and analyze information for potential business opportunities and better management of risks. For example, we have mobile-enabled all internet-based access and leveraged social media channels to reach out to potential customers to promote awareness of the company, including the products and services offered. We expect that technology will continue to evolve, offering new and more effective ways to reach and service our customers and shareholders. We evaluate available and evolving technologies and incorporate those we believe offer appropriate benefits to the company and its customers.\nThe foregoing review of important factors related to the Proposed Transaction should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included herein and elsewhere, including the risk factors included in Brookfield Reinsurance's Registration Statement on Form and in this 2021 Annual Report and other documents of the Company and Brookfield Reinsurance on file with the SEC. Neither the Company nor Brookfield Reinsurance undertakes any obligation to update, correct or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Company or Brookfield Reinsurance and/or any person acting on behalf of either of them are expressly qualified in their entirety by this paragraph. The information contained on any websites referenced in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe following table presents life insurance sales as measured by annualized premium, which allows a comparison of new policies sold by an insurance company during the period (in thousands):\nReinsurance\nLife insurance in-force increased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020 despite a reduction of policies in-force due to an increase in sales of higher face amount policies.\nOur business has been and will continue to be influenced by several industry-wide, segment or product-specific trends and conditions. In our discussion below, we first outline the broad macro-economic or industry trends (General Trends) that we expect to impact our overall business. Second, we discuss certain segment-specific trends we believe may impact individual segments or specific products within these segments.\n\u2022Initial Expected Loss Ratio-This method calculates an estimate of ultimate losses by applying an estimated loss ratio to actual earned premium for each calendar/accident year. This method is appropriate for classes of business where the actual paid or reported loss experience is not yet mature enough to influence initial expectations of the ultimate loss ratios.\n\u2022the Company or Brookfield Reinsurance may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors as well as management's response to any of the aforementioned factors.\n\n\u2022The allowance for credit losses is also affected by factors outside of our control including, but not limited to, market volatility, deterioration in the credit or prospects of companies and governmental entities, political uncertainty, industry trends, pandemics, and trends in interest rates; and\nDemographics: We believe a key driver shaping the actions of the life insurance industry is the rising income protection, wealth accumulation and insurance needs of an increasing number of retirees. As a result of increasing longevity and uncertainty regarding the Social Security System and an ongoing transition from defined benefit pension plans to 401(k) type retirement plans, retirees will need to accumulate sufficient savings to support retirement income requirements.\n(1)Result of adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\nAutomobile: Net premiums written decreased primarily due to fewer policies in-force. Net premiums earned increased primarily due to a decrease in COVID-19 relief policy credits which were $1.9 million in 2021 compared to $16.8 million in 2020. The loss and loss adjustment expense and combined ratios increased primarily due to an increase in claim frequency compared to the prior year due to the lessening impact of COVID-19.\n\u2022An increase in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (\"DAC\") related to corrective actions impacting contract issue and administration processes, as well as an increase in claims in our Worksite line of business driven by short-term disability\n\u2022Calendar Year Paid Adjusting and Other Expense to Paid Loss-This method uses a selected prior calendar years' paid expense to paid loss ratio to project ultimate loss adjustment expenses for adjusting and other expense. A percentage of the selected ratio is applied to the case reserves (depending on the line of insurance) and 100% to the indicated IBNR reserves. These ratios assume that a percentage of the expense is incurred when a claim is opened and the remaining percentage is paid throughout the claim's life.\n\u2022Changes in the provision for credit losses can be material to the financial position and results of operations for the Company;\nIn addition, the Company has agreed to specific restrictions relating to the conduct of its business between the date of the Merger Agreement and the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, not to take (or permit any of its subsidiaries to take) the following actions (subject, in each case, to exceptions specified below and in the Merger Agreement or previously disclosed in writing to Brookfield Reinsurance as provided in the Merger Agreement or as consented to in writing in advance by Brookfield Reinsurance (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) or as required by law:\nProperty and Casualty\nReserves for fixed deferred annuities are established equivalent to the account value held on behalf of the policyholder. Reserves for indexed annuities are calculated in accordance with derivative accounting guidance which defines a host liability for return of principal and guaranteed interest, and an embedded derivative liability for funded benefits in excess of the host guarantee. Additional reserves for benefits that can exceed contract fund value, such as lifetime income riders, are determined as needed in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. The profit recognition on deferred annuity contracts is gradual over the expected life of the contract. No immediate profit is recognized on the sale of the contract.\n\u2022incur, guarantee or assume any indebtedness, subject to certain limited exceptions, including investment portfolio transactions in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and other incurrences of indebtedness not to exceed $10,000,000 in the aggregate;\nWe use reinsurance to mitigate certain risks to the Life segment. During 2021, our retention limits were $5.0 million for issue ages 75 and under, and $2.0 million for issue ages 76 through 80, and $1.0 million for issue ages 81 and older for traditional and universal life. In our Life segment, we currently retain 100% of newly developed permanent and term products up to our retention limit and cede the excess. American National utilizes facultative reinsurance when a case requires support that does not follow the Company's standard underwriting guidelines. Accidental death and premium waiver benefits are mostly retained on new business. The reduction in reinsurance ceded is due to a change in retention limits effective January 1, 2019.\n\u2022Mortality rates will remain reasonably consistent within standard industry mortality table ranges; and\n\u2022Estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses require us to project future cash flows, delinquencies, collateral values, occupancy rates, prepayments based on a reasonable and supportable forecast in order to estimate probability of default and the loss given default;\n\u2022enter into any material contract or reinsurance contract other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice; and\n(1)A.M. Best rating as of the most current information available February 9, 2022.\n\u2022A change in estimate in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to our equity-indexed annuity products that resulted in an increase of $23.0 million in earnings from our Annuity segment. The impacts of the change in estimate consist of an increase to policyholder benefits of $47.1 million, deferred policy acquisition costs of $26.3 million and a reduction in interest credited to policyholders' account balances of $96.4 million\nPremium Deficiency Reserves-Deficiency reserves are established when the expected future claim payments and expenses for a classification of policies are in excess of the expected premiums for these policies. The determination of a deficiency reserve takes into consideration the likelihood of premium rate increases, the timing of these increases, future net investment income, and the expected benefit utilization patterns. We have established premium deficiency reserves for portions of the major medical business and the long-term care business that are in run-off. The assumptions and methods used to determine the deficiency reserves are reviewed periodically for reasonableness, and the reserve amount is monitored against emerging losses.\n\u2022subject to certain limited exceptions, offer, issue, sell, transfer, pledge, dispose of or encumber any shares of, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, or options, warrants, calls, commitments or rights of any kind to acquire, any shares of capital stock or other voting or equity interests of any class or series of the Company or its subsidiaries;\nCertain statements made in this report, including but not limited to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto appearing in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data herein, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Item 7 (\"MD&A\"), and the exhibits and financial statement schedules filed as a part hereof or incorporated by reference herein, may contain or incorporate by reference information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally are indicated by words such as expects,\u201d intends,\u201d anticipates,\u201d plans,\u201d believes,\u201d estimates,\u201d will\u201d or words of similar meaning, and include, without limitation, statements regarding the outlook of our business and expected financial performance, and certain statements relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential effects on the Company. These forward-looking statements are subject to changes and uncertainties which are, in many instances, beyond our control and have been made based upon our assumptions, expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect upon us. There can be no assurance that future developments will be in accordance with our expectations, that the effect of future developments on us will be as anticipated, or that our risk management policies and procedures will be effective, particularly given the uncertainty relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. We do not make public specific projections relating to future earnings, and we do not endorse any projections regarding future performance made by others. Additionally, we do not publicly update or revise forward-looking statements based on the outcome of various foreseeable or unforeseeable events. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve various risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements relate to the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the \"Proposed Transaction\"), as well as to the Company's financial and operating performance on a stand-alone basis prior to the consummation of the Merger or if the Merger is not consummated. There are certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ, possibly materially, from expectations or estimates reflected in such forward-looking statements, including without limitation risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, above and elsewhere in this report, and the following factors relating the Proposed Transaction:\nOur Property and Casualty segment consists of: (i) Personal products, marketed primarily to individuals, representing 52% of net premiums written; (ii) Commercial products, focused primarily on agricultural and other business related markets, representing 30% of net premiums written; and (iii) Specialty Markets Group products, marketed through independent managing general agents and managing general underwriters, representing 18% of net premiums written.\n\nCompetitive Pressures: The property and casualty insurance industry remains highly competitive. Despite the competitive environment, we expect to identify profitable opportunities through our strong distribution channels, expanding geographic coverage, marketing efforts, new product development and pricing sophistication.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization formally declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 to be a pandemic. A summary of significant actions the Company took in response to COVID-19 through December 31, 2020 is disclosed in our 2020 Annual Report on form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 4, 2021. Below is a summary of significant subsequent developments in our COVID-19 response:\nWe have notes payable relating to borrowings by real estate joint ventures that we consolidate into our financial statements that are not part of our capital resources. The lenders for the notes payable generally have no recourse against us in the event of default by the joint ventures. Therefore, the liability of American National relating to notes payable of the consolidated VIEs is limited to the amount of its direct or indirect investment in the respective ventures, which totaled $3.0 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\u2022We suspended our summer Internship Program for 2020, and in 2021 piloted a program which combined both virtual and in-person elements for a small group of interns. In 2022, we will be offering a hybrid program with virtual and in-person elements, to an expanded group of interns.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\n\u2022An overall increase in mortality which includes claims directly and indirectly attributable to COVID-19\nHealth segment financial results for the periods indicated were as follows (in thousands):\n\u2022An increase in net investment income from investment funds and mortgage loan profit participation and prepayment income\nEffective management of invested assets and associated liabilities using crediting rates and, where applicable, financial hedging instruments (which we use as economic hedges of equity-indexed life and annuity products), is important to the success of our Life and Annuity segments. Asset disintermediation,\u201d the risk of large outflows of cash at times when it is disadvantageous to us to dispose of invested assets, is a risk associated with these segments as are rates of mortality and surrenders that exceed our assumptions.\nChange in Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nAnnuity segment financial results for the periods indicated were as follows (in thousands):\nIBNR-IBNR liabilities are estimated based on many variables including historical statistical information, inflation, legal environment, economic conditions, trends in claim severity and frequency as well as other factors affecting the adequacy of claim reserves. Loss and premium data is aggregated by exposure class and by accident year. IBNR liabilities are estimated by projecting ultimate losses on each class of business and subtracting paid losses and case reserves. Our overall reserve practice provides for ongoing claims evaluation and adjustment based on the development of related data and other relevant information pertaining to claims. Adjustments in aggregate reserves, if any, are included in the results of operations for the period during which such adjustments are made.\nAnnuity\n\u2022subject to certain limited exceptions (including permitting the Company to execute investment portfolio transactions in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and in accordance with its existing investment plan and investment guidelines), acquire or agree to acquire any business or any corporation, partnership, association or other business organization or division thereof;\n\u2022A decrease in Property and Casualty segment earnings driven by an increase in net catastrophe losses and higher claim frequency in our personal automobile products as miles driven have increased\n\u2022An increase in fee income from various MGU programs\nAs a result of the Healthcare Acts of 2010 new opportunities were created in the limited benefit and supplemental product markets. In recent years, we built a portfolio of such products to be sold in the worksite market as well as to individuals. We believe that changes to the Healthcare Acts that removed the tax consequences for not having health coverage and the current removal of limitations on Short-Term Medical products could significantly increase our production. We constantly monitor the legislative environment for new changes that would impact our outlook on these products.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2021 to 2020\nEarnings for our Health segment decreased primarily due to the following:\nWe manage our investment portfolio to optimize the rate of return commensurate with sound and prudent asset selection and to maintain a well-diversified portfolio in support of our products and capital. Our investment operations are regulated primarily by the state insurance departments where our insurance companies are domiciled. Investment activities, including setting investment policies and defining acceptable risk levels, are subject to oversight by our Board of Directors, which is assisted by our Finance Committee, ALM Committee and Enterprise Risk Management Committee.\nCaution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nLife Insurance Sales\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, we sold the majority of our equity securities portfolio. Such sale was based upon senior management's assessment of market conditions and the potential for changes in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate. The sale resulted in net proceeds of $1.7 billion and did not have a significant impact on our stockholders' equity.\nThe Company holds collateral of $264.2 million at December 31, 2021 to offset exposure from its derivative counterparties. Cash flows associated with collateral received from counterparties change as the market value of the underlying derivative contract changes.\nChange in Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nAlthough we have been able to maintain our business operations since the onset of the pandemic, no assurance can be given that these actions will continue to be successful, nor can we predict the level of disruption that will occur should the COVID-19 pandemic and its related macroeconomic risks continue for further extended periods of time. Given this uncertainty, we are unable to quantify with reasonable confidence the total expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our future operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. The wide-ranging social, economic and financial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and the possible effects of ongoing and future governmental action in response to COVID-19 compound this uncertainty. Additional information regarding risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic are set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. For additional information regarding the direct and indirect impact to mortality refer to Part II, Item 7, MD&A, Life.\nDuring 2021, we retained the first $2.0 million of loss per risk. Our catastrophe reinsurance retention covering property and casualty companies in total is $35.0 million.\nTo address these challenges, we continue to seek out new and expanded uses for technology and social media that enhance our employer brand and educate candidates on the many benefits of working for us. Our planning and outreach efforts to develop a more diverse and inclusive workplace continue and help to strengthen the engagement of current employees as well as attract future employees. We continue to amplify the voice of our employees with regular surveys which help us grow and innovate. We actively value the perspectives that each employee brings and encourage broader employee influence on how decisions are made. As a result, we continue to experience increase in overall employee engagement. Providing robust career development conversations and career paths, personal growth opportunities and effective succession planning are also important elements of our retention and employee development efforts.\n\u2022Future interest spreads will remain reasonably consistent with our current expectations.\nInterest income on mortgage loans is accrued on the principal amount of the loan at the contractual interest rate. Accretion of discounts is recorded using the effective yield method. Interest income, accretion of discounts and prepayment fees are reported in net investment income. Interest is not accrued on loans generally more than 90 days past due or when the collection of interest is not considered probable. Loans in foreclosure are placed on non-accrual status. Interest received on non-accrual status mortgage loans is included in net investment income in the period received.\n\n(2)Includes undiscounted case reserves for reported claims and reserves for IBNR with the timing of future payments based on our historical payment patterns. The timing of these payments may vary significantly from the pattern shown in the preceding table. The ultimate losses may vary materially from the recorded amounts, which are our best estimates.\nITEM 7.

The loss and loss adjustment expense and combined ratios improved primarily due to lower losses for Credit GAP products, partially offset by an increase in net catastrophe losses from $4.2 million in 2020 to $12.3 million in 2021.\n\n\u2022Lower DAC amortization for fixed deferred products due to an increase in estimated gross profits driven by higher projected future interest rates compared to previous expectations\nThe accounting estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses over financial assets held at amortized cost have been evaluated and monitored since adoption and management has deemed these estimates to be critical for the following reasons:\nThe following table summarizes the Company's catastrophe reinsurance coverage effective during 2021:\nProceeds from the sale of the equity securities portfolio will be reinvested primarily in fixed income investments. We expect that such sale, coupled with the reinvestment of proceeds in primarily fixed income investments, will have a positive impact on our net investment income and cash flows, as well as on the Risk Based Capital of our insurance company subsidiaries that held equity security investments. Such actions will also mitigate fluctuations in net income associated with non-cash earnings from net gains (losses) from the change in fair value of equity securities.\nWe believe we are well positioned to address the increasing need for savings tools and income protection. We believe our overall financial strength and broad distribution channels position us to respond with a variety of products for individuals approaching retirement age, who seek information to plan for and manage their retirement needs. We believe our products that offer guaranteed income flows are well suited to serve this market.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nThe increase in earnings was partially offset by the following:\n\u2022A favorable change in investment credit loss due to improvement in our commercial mortgage loans driven by improvement in cash flows and a positive economic outlook from our properties, and improving conditions in travel and leisure\n\nMerger Agreement's Restrictions on Interim Operations. The Company has agreed to certain covenants in the Merger Agreement restricting the conduct of its business between the date of the Merger Agreement and the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of the Merger Agreement. The general effect of these covenants is that, during such interim period, the Company will be limited in its ability to pursue strategic and operational matters outside the ordinary course of business. The Company has agreed that it and its subsidiaries will conduct their business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice in all material respects and use reasonable best efforts to preserve their business organizations, goodwill and assets, keep available the services of their current key officers and employees, and preserve their present relationships with governmental entities and other key third parties, including customers, reinsurers, distributors, suppliers and other persons with whom the Company and its subsidiaries have business relationships.\nSince our estimate for the allowance for credit losses relies on management judgment and is sensitive to factors outside of our control, as noted above, there are inherent uncertainties within the estimates. As a result, the changes in the allowance for credit losses could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nWe offer our personal and commercial property and casualty lines of business primarily through our multiple line agencies. We favor a balanced, focused and collaborative approach to both growth and profitability through the development of successful agencies.\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands):\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2021 to 2020\nWe use multiple reinsurers with each reinsurer absorbing part of the overall risk ceded.

The two major categories of CAE are defense and cost containment expense, and adjusting and other expense. The details of property and casualty liability for unpaid claims are shown below (in thousands):\nMedicare Supplement claims decreased driven by policy lapses. In addition, claims experience for our Medical Expense, MGU and Supplemental health lines of business improved but was partially offset by an increase in short-term disability claims from our Worksite line of business.\nThe following table summarizes changes in the Life segment's in-force amounts (in thousands):\nWe have consistently paid dividends to our stockholders and expect to continue this tradition in the foreseeable future. There are no other known trends or uncertainties regarding product pricing, changes in product lines or rising costs that are expected to have a significant impact to cash flows from operations, although uncertainties relating to the COVID-19 pandemic could still significantly impact one or more of these items.\nThe Aggregate Property Catastrophe Excess cover provides for $30.0 million of limit excess of $160.0 million of aggregated catastrophe losses. Qualifying losses include amounts of retained losses net of other reinsurance below $35.0 million on Property Claims Services ( PCS\u201d) declared catastrophe events and internally declared catastrophe events exceeding $5.0 million. This cover was placed at 55% for 2021 and does not include a reinstatement.\nITEM 7.

The entity's liability is limited to its investment in the respective joint venture. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6, Real Estate and Other Investments, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.\nWe believe the estimates used in our DAC calculations provide insight into how variations in assumptions and estimates would affect our business. The following table displays the sensitivity of reasonably likely changes in assumptions in the DAC amortization for our long-duration business at December 31, 2021 (in thousands):\n\nHealth claims incurred for the periods indicated were as follows (in thousands):\n\n\nOur cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment position increased from $1.4 billion at December 31, 2020 to $3.8 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase primarily relates to the fourth quarter 2021 sale of a majority of the Company's equity securities portfolio which resulted in an excess cash position. We intend to reinvest the cash proceeds consistent with our investment guidelines during 2022.\nFor 2021, the companies to which we have ceded reinsurance for the Health segment are shown below (in thousands, except percentages):\n\u2022An increase in net gains on equity securities due to more favorable market conditions in 2021 compared to the negative impact from the pandemic in 2020 on the fair value of our equity securities\n\u2022No significant prospective changes in laws that would significantly affect future payouts.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nEarnings for our Life segment decreased primarily due to the following:\nLife and Annuity\n\u2022No unusual growth patterns or unexpected changes in the mix of business; and\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nProducts\nWe reinsure a portion of the risks that we underwrite to manage our loss exposure. In return for ceded premiums, reinsurers assume a portion of the claims incurred. In addition to our reinsurance coverage, we are partially protected by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 and its predecessors. We participate in the National Flood Insurance Program administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs (DAC)\nCOVID-19 Response\nPremium Deficiency Reserve-Deficiency reserves are recorded when the expected claims payments and policy maintenance costs for a product line exceed the expected premiums for that product line. The estimation of a deficiency reserve considers the current profitability of a product line using anticipated claims, CAE, and policy maintenance costs. The assumptions and methods used to determine the need for deficiency reserves are reviewed periodically for reasonableness. There were no reserves of this type at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\nShort-Term Investments-Short-term investments are primarily commercial paper rated A2 or P2 or better by Standard & Poor's and Moody's, respectively. The amount fluctuates depending on our view of the desirability of investing in the available long-term investment opportunities and our liquidity needs, including mortgage investment-funding commitments.\nThe primary use of cash has been and is expected to continue to be payment of policyholder benefits and claims incurred. Current and expected patterns of claim frequency and severity may change from period to period but continue to be within historical norms. Management considers our current liquidity position to be sufficient to meet anticipated demands over the next twelve months.\nIn addition, reinsurance is used in the credit life business primarily to provide producers of credit-related insurance products the opportunity to participate in the underwriting risk through producer-owned captive reinsurance companies often domiciled outside of the United States. A majority of the treaties entered into by our Specialty Markets Group are written on a 100% coinsurance basis with benefit limits of $0.1 million on credit life.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nCommercial Products\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nCase Reserves-Reserves for reported losses are determined on either a judgment or a formula basis, depending on the timing and type of the loss. The formula reserve is a fixed amount for each claim of a given type based on historical paid loss data for similar claims with a provision for claim inflation. Judgment reserve amounts replace initial formula reserves and are set for each loss based on facts and circumstances of each case and the expectation of damages.

The available liquidity at February 9, 2022 was approximately $879.3 million.\nFuture Policy Benefits\n\n*Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13. Adoption of this guidance resulted in an allowance for credit losses primarily on our commercial mortgage loans and related off-balance sheet unfunded loan commitments, held-to-maturity bonds and reinsurance recoverables. The results for 2019 have not been restated to conform to the current presentation.\nTotal Life sales increased 9.2% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020 as new life sales rebounded from the COVID-19 economic uncertainties and social distancing practices during 2020.\nBased on information currently available, we believe that amounts ultimately paid, if any, arising from existing and currently potential litigation would not have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. However, it should be noted that the frequency of large damage awards, which bear little or no relation to the economic damages incurred by plaintiffs, continues to create the potential for an unpredictable judgment in any given lawsuit. It is possible that, if the defenses in these lawsuits are not successful, and the judgments are greater than we anticipate, the resulting liability could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nRegulatory Approval Process. The completion of the Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the Merger\u201d) is subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions, including obtaining the required regulatory approval from the insurance authorities in Texas, Missouri, New York, Louisiana and California. The required insurance regulatory process has been moving forward consistent with our prior disclosures, and we continue to expect to complete the Merger before the end of the first half of 2022. However, because state insurance regulatory approval remains outstanding, the Company cannot provide assurance the Merger will be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all.\n\u2022The increase in commissions was primarily attributable to an increase in premiums written for our specialty markets products.

Policy credits were $0.9 million for commercial automobile policies in 2020\nLow interest rates are also challenging for property and casualty insurers. Investment income is an important element in earning an acceptable return on capital. Lower interest rates resulting in lower investment income require us to achieve better underwriting results. We have adjusted policy prices to help mitigate the adverse impact of low interest rates on our property and casualty business.\nCommercial Automobile: Net premiums written and earned increased primarily due to rate increases. The loss and loss adjustment expense and combined ratios improved primarily due to favorable prior year claim development and rate increases.\n\u2022Management judgment is required to determine which models, methodologies, and scenario conditions are used to calculate the allowance for credit losses to produce a reasonable estimate that encompasses the expected lifetime credit losses.\n\u2022We have developed and are continually refining our return-to-office plans for our locations. Beginning in June 2021, we gradually re-introduced more employees to our office locations but had to lessen our in-office presence in the latter part of the year due to a surge in the Omicron variant. We are continually monitoring the situation with a longer-term plan to offer employees hybrid work schedules, where possible.\n\u2022subject to certain limited exceptions, sell, lease, license, transfer, pledge, subject to any encumbrance or otherwise dispose of any of its or their assets or properties;\nOur contractual obligations are not expected to have a significant negative impact to cash flows from operations. American National has agreed to pay our financial advisor in connection with the Merger, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (\"Citi\"), for its Merger-related services an aggregate fee of $40.0 million, of which $3.0 million was paid upon delivery of Citi's fairness opinion related to the Merger entered into on August 6, 2021 and the remaining $37.0 million is payable contingent upon consummation of the Merger, which has not been reflected in the consolidated statement of operations. In addition, the Company agreed to reimburse Citi for expenses, including fees and expenses of counsel, and to indemnify Citi and related parties against certain liabilities, including liabilities under federal securities laws, arising from Citi's engagement.\n\u2022An increase in net investment income due to higher option gains resulting from favorable market conditions\n\u2022Consistent claims handling, reserving and payment processes;\n(1)A.M. Best rating as of the most current information available February 9, 2022.\nInterest and Mortality Margin\nEarnings for our Property and Casualty segment decreased primarily due to the following:\n(1)Refer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for explanation of prior year retrospective adjustment\nAnnuity Reserving-Reserves for payout annuities with more than insignificant amounts of mortality risk are calculated in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for limited pay insurance contracts. Benefit and maintenance expense reserves are calculated by using assumptions reflecting our expectations of future costs, including an appropriate margin for adverse deviation. These assumptions are locked-in at issue and generally reflect pricing assumptions from that period. If the resulting reserve would otherwise cause profits to be recognized at the issue date, additional reserves are recorded. The resulting recognition of profits would be gradual over the expected life of the contract.\nCompetitive Pressures: In recent years, the competitive landscape of the U.S. life insurance industry has shifted. Established insurers are competing against each other and also against new market entrants that are developing products to attract the interest of the growing number of retirees. Competition exists in terms of retaining and acquiring consumers' business and also in terms of access to producers and distributors. Consolidation among distributors coupled with the aging sales force remains a challenge among insurers. In addition, the increased technological sophistication of consumers necessitates that insurers and distributors invest significant resources in technology to adapt to consumer expectations. We believe we possess sufficient scale, financial strength, resources and flexibility to compete effectively.\nThis MD&A should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n\n\nWe have decided to exit the Medicare Supplement market due to increasing pricing pressures and deterioration of new sales and operational performance. Marketing efforts are refocused to MGU, Worksite and Individual Supplemental lines of business.\nPolicy Loans-For certain life insurance products, policyholders may borrow funds using the policy's cash value as collateral. The maximum amount of the policy loan depends upon the policy's surrender value. As of December 31, 2021, we had $365.2 million in policy loans with a loan to surrender value of approximately 54%, and at December 31, 2020, we had $373.0 million in policy loans with a loan to surrender value of approximately 56%. Interest rates on policy loans primarily range from 3.0% to 12.0% per annum. Policy loans may be repaid at any time by the policyholder and have priority to any claims on the policy. If the policyholder fails to repay the policy loan, funds are withdrawn from the policy's benefits.\nEarnings for our Corporate and Other segment increased primarily due to the following:\nChanging Regulatory Environment: The insurance industry is primarily regulated at the state level, although some life and annuity products and services are also subject to U.S. federal regulation. We are regularly subjected to additional or changing regulation that requires us to update systems, change product structure, increase the amount of reporting or adopt changes to distribution. These changes may increase the capital requirements for us and the industry, increase operating costs, change our operating practices and change our ability to provide products with pricing attractive to the marketplace.\nThe changes in our capital resources are summarized below (in thousands):\nFor 2021, the companies to whom we have ceded reinsurance for the Life segment are shown below (in thousands, except percentages):\n\u2022Loss or Expense Development (Chain Ladder)-This method uses actual loss or defense and cost containment expense data and the historical development profiles on older accident periods to project more recent, less developed periods to their ultimate total. This method is appropriate when there is a relatively stable pattern of loss and expense emergence and a relatively large number of reported claims.\nTo acquire and retain profitable business, we use sophisticated pricing models and risk segmentation, along with a focused distribution force. We believe this approach allows us to make product enhancements and offer programs that are charging an appropriate premium for the risk.\nLife and Annuity Liability for Unpaid Claims\nCorporate and Other segment financial results for the periods indicated were as follows (in thousands):\nAdditional Information:\nWorkers Compensation: The loss and loss adjustment expense and combined ratios increased primarily due to an increase in claim severity.\nThe Company sells equity-indexed universal life and equity-indexed deferred annuity contracts with guaranteed minimum benefits, some of which contain embedded derivatives that are required to be bifurcated from a host reserve, separately accounted for, and measured at fair value. We utilize over-the-counter equity options to hedge our exposure to equity-indexed universal life and equity-indexed deferred annuity benefits, and the fair values for these options are sourced from broker quotations. Accounting guidance requires a fair value calculation as part of equity-indexed policy reserves. This is called the value of embedded derivative (\"VED\") and the other part of the indexed policy reserve is called the host reserve. The embedded derivative represents future benefit cash flows in excess of the minimum guarantee cash flows. The host covers the minimum guarantee cash flows. Both the VED and the host reserve are calculated by a vendor-sourced reserve valuation system. The VED calculation model incorporates assumptions related to current option pricing (such as implied volatility and interest rates), future policyholder behavior (such as surrenders and withdrawals), and factors affecting the value of future indexed interest periods (such as option budgets). These assumptions are evaluated annually by management with any changes in the estimated fair value resulting in a cumulative charge or credit to income from operations.\n\u2022events, changes or other circumstances could occur that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement;\nHealth\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nITEM 7.

Our subsidiaries may obtain additional statutory capital through various sources, such as retained statutory earnings or equity contributions from us.\nThe Property Catastrophe Top and Drop cover consists of $30.0 million of annual limit available either wholly or in part across two layers of coverage. The first layer is 100% of $30.0 million excess of $470.0 million on an occurrence basis. The second layer provides aggregate protection where subject loss is $15.0 million excess of $20.0 million of each catastrophe, and recoveries follow satisfaction of a $15.0 million annual aggregate deductible. The second layer acts to reduce the retention on large second and third catastrophe events to $20.0 million following a first large catastrophe. This cover was placed at 100% for 2021 and does not include a reinstatement.\nHomeowners: Net premiums written and earned increased primarily due to rate increases.\n(1)Life and annuity obligations include undiscounted estimated claim, benefit, surrender and commission obligations offset by expected future premiums and deposits on in-force insurance policies and annuity contracts. All amounts are gross of any reinsurance recoverable. Estimated claim, benefit and surrender obligations are based on mortality and lapse assumptions comparable with historical experience. Estimated payments on interest-sensitive life and annuity obligations include interest credited to those products. The interest crediting rates are derived by deducting current product spreads from a constant investment yield. As a result, the estimated obligations for insurance liabilities included in the table exceed the liabilities recorded in the liability for future policy benefits and policy and contract claims. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the amounts presented could materially differ from actual payments. Separate account obligations have not been included in the table since those obligations are not part of the general account obligations and will be funded by cash flows from separate account assets. The general account obligations for insurance liabilities will be funded by cash flows from general account assets and future premiums and deposits. Participating policyholder dividends payable consists of liabilities related to dividends payable in the following calendar year and are presented in the less than one-year category. All estimated cash payments are net of estimated future premiums on policies currently in-force net of future policyholder dividends payable. The participating policyholders' share obligation included in other policyholder funds and the timing and amount of the ultimate participating policyholder obligation is subject to significant uncertainty and the amount of the participating policyholder obligation is based upon a long-term projection of the performance of the participating policy block.\n\n\u2022the announcement or pendency of the Proposed Transaction could affect the relationships of the Company or Brookfield Reinsurance with its clients, and operating results and business generally, including on our ability to retain and attract employees;\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has devoted key resources to make employee health and safety a top priority. These efforts are having a positive impact as reflected in recent employee engagement survey results. Additionally, as we speak with candidates during the talent acquisition process, our precautions and protocols to ensure employee safety have been important to them when making the decision to join us. As we proceed though the pandemic, employee safety, productivity and retention are vital to meeting business goals and objectives.\nThe Corporate and Other segment acts as the owner of all invested assets of the Company. The investment income from the invested assets is allocated to the insurance segments in accordance with the assets allocated to each insurance segment. Earnings of the Corporate and Other segment are derived from income related to invested assets not allocated to the insurance segments and from our non-insurance subsidiaries. All realized investment gains and losses, which includes other-than-temporary impairments ( OTTI\u201d) and credit losses, are recorded in this segment.\n\u2022authorize, recommend, propose, enter into or adopt a plan or agreement of complete or partial liquidation, dissolution, merger, consolidation, restructuring, recapitalization or other reorganization of the Company or any of its subsidiaries;\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2021 to 2020\n\nAnnuity premium and deposit amounts received are shown below (in thousands):\nThe table below summarizes reinsurance reserves and premium amounts assumed and ceded (in thousands):\nITEM 7.

These modifications were in the form of forbearance of principal and interest payments for up to six months, extensions of maturity dates, and/or provisions for interest only payments. The modifications were primarily related to our loans to hotels, retail and parking operations. Due to the ongoing economic stress brought on by the pandemic, additional modifications for 33 of these loans with a total balance of $725.7 million were made during 2021. These additional modifications extended the forbearance of principal and interest payments and interest only provisions with a requirement for the payment of at least 20% of the total interest due during the extended modification period. The modified loans had an aggregate deferred interest of $5.6 million as of December 31, 2021. There are no commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose loans have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring during the periods presented. The decrease in loans determined to be a troubled debt restructuring during 2021 is primarily attributable to improved economic conditions after lifting of COVID-19 related restrictions.\nSpecialty Markets Products\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted ASC 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, accounting guidance related to the allowance for credit losses. The new standard significantly changed how entities measure credit losses for most financial assets and reinsurance recoverables that are not measured at fair value through net income. The guidance replaced the current incurred loss\u201d approach with an expected loss\u201d model for instruments measured at amortized cost. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4, Investment in Securities, and Note 5, Mortgage Loans, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the accounting policies and methodologies for establishing the allowance for credit losses.\nThe fair value of available-for-sale fixed maturity and equity securities is determined by management using one of the three primary sources of information: the quoted prices in active markets, third-party pricing services, or independent broker quotations. Estimated fair value of securities based on quoted prices in active markets is readily and regularly available; therefore, valuation of these securities generally does not involve management judgment. For securities without quoted prices, fair value measurement is determined using third-party pricing services' proprietary pricing applications. Typical inputs used by the models are relevant market information, benchmark curves, benchmark pricing of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing. Any securities remaining unpriced after utilizing the first two pricing methods are submitted to independent brokers for prices. We have analyzed the third-party pricing services and independent brokers' valuation methodologies and related inputs, and have evaluated the various types of securities in our investment portfolio to determine an appropriate fair value hierarchy level based upon trading activity and the observability of market inputs. Management completes certain tests throughout the year and at year-end to determine that prices provided by our pricing services are reasonable.\nOur capital resources are summarized below (in thousands):\nHealth liabilities for unpaid claims are established using the following methods:\nOur defined benefit plans are frozen and currently adequately funded; however, low interest rates, increased longevity of participants, and rising Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ( PBGC\u201d) premiums may cause us to increase our funding of the plans.\nLiquidity\n\nStatutory Capital and Surplus and Risk-based Capital\n\u2022there are risks related to disruption of management's attention from the ongoing business operations of the Company or Brookfield Reinsurance due to the Proposed Transaction;\nStatutory capital and surplus is the capital of our insurance companies reported in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the applicable state insurance departments. RBC is calculated using formulas applied to certain financial balances and activities that consider, among other things, investment risks related to the type and quality of investments, insurance risks associated with products and liabilities, interest rate risks and general business risks. Insurance companies that do not maintain capital and surplus at a level of at least 100% of the company action level RBC are required to take certain actions. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, ANICO's statutory capital and surplus was $4.0 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. ANICO and each of our insurance subsidiaries had statutory capital and surplus at December 31, 2021 and 2020 above 200% of the company action level except ANPAC Louisiana Insurance Company (\"ANPLA\"), which had an RBC level of 194% at December 31, 2020, which increased to 242% at December 31, 2021.\nAgricultural Business: Our agricultural business product allows policyholders to customize and cover their agriculture exposure using a package policy, which includes coverage for residences and household contents, farm and ranch buildings and building contents, personal and commercial liability and personal property. Net premiums written and earned increased primarily due to increases in policies in-force and rate increases.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThis MD&A should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

The American National companies operate in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. In addition to ANICO, major subsidiaries include American National Life Insurance Company of Texas, American National Life Insurance Company of New York, American National Property and Casualty Company, Garden State Life Insurance Company, Standard Life and Accident Insurance Company, Farm Family Casualty Insurance Company and United Farm Family Insurance Company.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nThe Merger Agreement permits the Company to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends not to exceed $0.82 per share of common stock prior to completion of the Merger.\n(1)A negative change indicates more expense was deferred than amortized and represents a decrease to expenses in the period indicated.\nLife Reserving-Principal assumptions used in the determination of the reserves for future policy benefits are mortality, policy lapse rates, investment return, inflation, expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type. Reserves for incurred but not reported ( IBNR\u201d) claims on life policies are calculated using historical claims information. Reserves for interest-sensitive and variable universal life insurance policies are equal to the current account value calculated for the policyholder. Some of our universal life policies contain secondary guarantees, for which additional reserves are recorded based on the term of the policy.\nImportance of Operating Efficiencies: The volatile economic environment and costs associated with greater regulation create a further need for operating efficiencies. We manage our cost base while maintaining our commitment to provide superior customer service to policyholders and agents. Investments in technology are coordinated through a disciplined project management process. We anticipate continuous improvement in our use of technology to enhance our policyholders' and agents' experience and increase our overall operating effectiveness.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations are materially affected by economic and financial market conditions. The U.S. and global economies, as well as the capital markets, continue to show mixed signals, and uncertainties continue to be significant factors in the markets in which we operate. Factors such as consumer spending, business investment, the volatility of the capital markets, the level of interest rates, unemployment, the level of participation in the workforce and the risk of inflation or deflation will affect the business and economic environment and, in turn, impact the demand for the type of financial and insurance products we offer. Adverse changes in the economy could have a material adverse effect on us. However, we believe those risks are somewhat mitigated by our financial strength, active enterprise risk management and disciplined underwriting for our products. Our diverse product mix and distribution channels across insurance segments is a strength that we expect will help us adapt to the volatile economic environment and give us the ability to serve the changing needs of our customers. Additionally, through our long-term business approach, we believe we are financially strong, and we are committed to providing a steady and reliable source of financial protection for policyholders.\nWe have various agency, consulting and service arrangements with individuals and entities considered to be related parties. Each of these arrangements has been reviewed and approved by our Audit Committee, which retains final decision-making authority for these transactions. The amounts involved, both individually and in the aggregate, with these arrangements are not material to any segment or to our overall operations. For additional details see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 20, Related Party Transactions, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\u2022Ratio of Paid Defense and Cost Containment Expense to Paid Loss Development-This method uses the ratio of paid defense and cost containment expense to paid loss data and the historical development profiles on older accident periods to project more recent, less developed periods to their ultimate total. In this method, an ultimate ratio of paid defense and cost containment expense to paid loss is selected for each accident period. The selected paid defense and cost containment expense to paid loss ratio is then applied to the selected ultimate loss for each accident period to estimate the ultimate defense and cost containment expense. Paid defense and cost containment expense is then subtracted from the ultimate defense and cost containment expense to calculate the unpaid defense and cost containment expense for that accident period.\nReserve Development\n\u2022regulatory approvals required for the Proposed Transaction may not be obtained, or required regulatory approvals may delay the Proposed Transaction or result in the imposition of conditions that could have a material adverse effect on the Company or Brookfield Reinsurance or cause certain conditions to closing not to be satisfied, which could result in the termination of the Merger Agreement;\nWe had a DAC asset of approximately $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Net premiums written and earned increased due to rate increases in the rental owners product. The loss and loss adjustment expense and combined ratios improved due to fewer non-catastrophe losses.\nThe evaluation process to determine liability for unpaid claims involves the collaboration of underwriting, claims and actuarial departments. The process also includes consultation with independent actuarial firms as part of our process of gaining reassurance that claims and CAE liability estimate sufficiently, all obligations arising from all losses incurred as of year-end.\nFunds received as premium payments and deposits that are not used for liquidity requirements are generally invested in bonds and commercial mortgages. Funds are invested with the intent that income from the investments and proceeds from the maturities will meet our ongoing cash flow needs. We historically have not had to liquidate invested assets in order to cover cash flow needs. We believe our portfolio of highly liquid bonds and available-for-sale investment securities coupled with our ability to borrow funds through the FHLB, are sufficient to meet future liquidity needs as necessary.\n\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2021 to 2020\nLitigation Contingencies\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2021 to 2020\nA description of these critical accounting estimates is presented below.

Generally, mortgage loans are secured by first liens on income-producing real estate with a loan-to-value ratio of up to 75%. Mortgage loans are generally carried at outstanding principal balances, adjusted for any unamortized premium or discount, deferred fees or expenses, and net of allowances. The weighted average coupon yield on the principal funded for mortgage loans was 4.6% and 4.8% at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
