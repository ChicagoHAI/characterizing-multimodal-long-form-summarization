MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following is a discussion of our financial condition at December 31, 2016 and 2015 and our results of operations for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016. The purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from the consolidated financial statements. The following discussion and analysis should be read along with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein.\nOverview\nGeneral. Our fully diluted net income per common share for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $2.91 compared to fully diluted net income per common share of $2.52 and $2.01 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. At December 31, 2016, loans had increased by $1.907 billion as compared to December 31, 2015.\nWe acquired a 30% membership interest in Bankers Healthcare Group, LLC (BHG) on February 1, 2015 for $75.0 million in cash. On March 1, 2016, we increased our investment in BHG by 19%, for a total investment in BHG of 49%. The additional 19% interest was acquired for an amount of cash equal to $74.1 million and 860,470 shares of Pinnacle Financial common stock.\nWe acquired CapitalMark Bank and Trust (CapitalMark) on July 31, 2015 and Magna Bank (Magna) on September 1, 2015. We acquired Avenue Financial Holdings, Inc. (Avenue) and its bank subsidiary Avenue Bank on July 1, 2016. At the acquisition date, CapitalMark's net assets were fair valued at $73.2 million, including loans of $857.5 million and deposits valued at $953.2 million. At the acquisition date, Magna's net assets were fair valued at $49.1 million, including loans of $440.7 million and deposits valued at $452.7 million. At the acquisition date, Avenue's net assets were preliminarily fair valued at $81.7 million, including loans of $952.5 million and deposits valued at $966.7 million. These acquisitions further expanded our footprint into our core Tennessee markets.\nOur merger with Avenue was consummated on July 1, 2016. Each holder of Avenue common stock (including restricted shares) received 0.36 shares of Pinnacle Financial's common stock plus $2.00 per share in cash for each share of Avenue common stock held by each shareholder on the closing date. This acquisition increased our market share in the Nashville MSA. We issued approximately 3.76 million shares of our common stock and paid cash consideration of approximately $20.9 million (including payments related to fractional shares) to the Avenue shareholders and approximately $987,000 to holders of 257,639 outstanding unexercised stock options.\nOn January 22, 2016, we entered into the Merger Agreement to acquire BNC and its wholly owned bank subsidiary Bank of North Carolina. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of BNC's common stock will be converted into 0.5235 shares of Pinnacle Financial Common Stock and all of BNC's outstanding stock options that are not exercised prior to the closing will be cashed out for a payment equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the average closing prices of Pinnacle Financial's Common Stock for the ten (10) trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the closing date of the Merger (adjusted for the Exchange Ratio) over the exercise price of each such option and (ii) the number of shares of BNC common stock subject to each such option. Upon consummation of the Merger, we will assume BNC's obligations under its outstanding $60.0 million subordinated notes issued in September 2014 that mature in October 2024. The $50.5 million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated debentures issued by trust affiliates of BNC in connection with the issuance of trust preferred securities will also be assumed in connection with the Merger.\nResults of operations. Our net interest income increased to $325.0 million for 2016 compared to $236.6 million for 2015 and $193.0 million for 2014. The net interest margin (the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets) for 2016 was 3.70% compared to 3.72% and 3.75% for 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOur provision for loan losses was $18.3 million for 2016 compared to $9.2 million in 2015 and $3.6 million in 2014. Provision expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the comparable periods in 2015 and 2014 was impacted by increased charge-offs realized in our consumer portfolio, primarily related to automobile loans. Our net charge-offs were $24.8 million during 2016 compared to $11.1 million in 2015 and $4.2 million in 2014.\nOur allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased from 1.00% at December 31, 2015 to 0.70% at December 31, 2016, largely because the loans we acquired in conjunction with the Avenue merger were reflected at fair value at the acquisition date. Management believes the decrease in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was supported by the credit quality in our loan portfolio despite increasing charge-offs related to automobile financing, which represents a small portion of the total portfolio. The overall methodology used to estimate the allowance for loan losses is consistent with the prior year. For purchased loans (including those acquired in connection with our mergers), the allowance for loan losses subsequent to the acquisition date is consistent with that utilized for legacy Pinnacle Financial loans. Our accounting policy is to compare the computed allowance for loan losses on purchased loans to the remaining fair value adjustment at the individual loan level. If the computed allowance is greater than the remaining fair value adjustment, the excess is added to the allowance for loan losses by a provision for loan losses. Additional provisioning for purchased portfolios results from credit deterioration on the individual loan or from increased borrowings on loans and lines that existed as of the acquisition date.\nNoninterest income for 2016 compared to 2015 increased by $34.5 million, or 39.8%. The increase was primarily due to income from our investment in BHG, which was $31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Income from equity method investment represents our 30% equity method investment in BHG for the year ended December 31, 2015 and beginning on March 1, 2016 also includes our additional 19% investment in BHG. The additional growth was attributable to our overall increase in our geographic footprint, increased transaction accounts, increased production in our fee-based products such as investments, insurance and trust and net gains on the sale of mortgage loans. The year-over-year growth in net gains on the sale of mortgage loans was attributed to both an increase in the number of mortgage originators as well as the positive impact of the low interest rate environment on mortgage production. Noninterest income for 2015 compared to 2014 increased by $33.9 million, or 64.5%, which was primarily attributable to our 30% equity method investment in BHG. The remaining increase was attributable to increased interchange revenues as well as increased production in our fee-based products such as investments, insurance and trust.\nNoninterest expense for 2016 compared to 2015 increased by $65.4 million, or 38.3%, primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $34.9 million, resulting from annual merit increases awarded in the first quarter of 2016, and the increase in our associate base. We also realized increases in equipment and occupancy costs due to our mergers. Additionally, merger expense accounted for approximately $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $4.8 million of expense during the same period in 2015. Merger expense during 2016 includes legal costs incurred associated with the Avenue merger to defend ourselves and Avenue's directors in a shareholder suit as well as investigation and other legal costs associated with a former director's alleged improper trading in Avenue common stock. Merger expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, also includes the costs of technical conversions which were completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 for Magna, in the first quarter of 2016 for CapitalMark and in the third quarter of 2016 for Avenue. Associate related expenses such as retention bonuses are also included in these expenses. We do not expect any future merger-related charges due to the acquisitions of CapitalMark and Magna, and we do not expect future merger-related charges due to the acquisition of Avenue, if any, to be significant. However, merger-related charges are expected to be incurred with our proposed acquisition of BNC during 2017. Noninterest expense for 2015 compared to 2014 increased by $34.6 million, or 25.4%, Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $17.6 million, resulting from annual merit increases awarded in the first quarter of 2015, and the increase in our associate base as a result of both organic new hires and new hires resulting from our mergers with CapitalMark and Magna. We also realized increases in equipment and occupancy costs due to our mergers with CapitalMark and Magna. Additionally, merger expenses accounted for approximately $4.8 million of expense during 2015.\nThe number of full-time equivalent employees increased from 764.0 at December 31, 2014 to 1,058.5 at December 31, 2015 and 1,179.5 at December 31, 2016.\nDuring the three years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, Pinnacle Financial recorded income tax expense of $64.2 million, $47.6 million and $35.2 million, respectively. Pinnacle's effective tax rate for the three years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, was 33.5%, 33.3% and 33.3%, respectively, and differs from the combined federal and state income statutory rate primarily due to our investments in bank-qualified municipal securities, our real estate investment trust, participation in Tennessee's Community Investment Tax Credit (CITC) program, bank-owned life insurance and tax savings from our captive insurance subsidiary, offset in part by the limitation on deductibility of meals and entertainment expense and certain merger-related expenses.\nOur efficiency ratio (the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income) was 53.0%, 52.9% and 55.5% for the three years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The efficiency ratio measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue.\nNet income for 2016 was $127.2 million compared to $95.5 million in net income in 2015 and $70.5 million in 2014. Fully-diluted net income per common share was $2.91 for 2016 compared to $2.52 for 2015 and $2.01 for 2014.\nFinancial Condition. Our loan balances increased by $1.907 billion during 2016 compared to an increase of $1.953 billion in 2015. The increase in our outstanding loan balances is the result of our acquisitions, as well as the continued economic growth in our other Tennessee markets, increases in the number of relationship advisors and increased focus on attracting new customers to our company.\nTotal deposits increased from $6.971 billion at December 31, 2015 to $8.759 billion at December 31, 2016. Within our deposits, the ratio of core funding to total deposits decreased slightly from 84.5% at December 31, 2015 to 81.6% at December 31, 2016.\nWe believe we have hired experienced relationship managers that have significant client portfolios and longstanding reputations within the communities we serve. As such, we believe they will attract more relationship managers to our firm as well as loans and deposits from new and existing small-and middle-market clients as the economies in our principal markets continue to expand.\nCapital and Liquidity. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, our capital ratios, including our bank's capital ratios, exceeded regulatory minimum capital requirements. From time to time we may be required to support the capital needs of our bank subsidiary. At December 31, 2016, we had approximately $37.0 million of cash at the holding company which could be used to support our bank. We believe we have various capital raising techniques available to us to provide for the capital needs of our bank, if necessary. In January 2017, we completed a public offering of 3.22 million shares of our common stock in a transaction that resulted in net proceeds to us, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated other expenses payable by us, of approximately $191.2 million. We have contributed $185.0 million of these net proceeds to our bank subsidiary.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe accounting principles we follow and our methods of applying these principles conform with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and with general practices within the banking industry. In connection with the application of those principles, we have made judgments and estimates which, in the case of the determination of our allowance for loan losses, the valuation of other real estate owned, the assessment of the valuation of deferred tax assets and the assessment of impairment of intangibles, has been critical to the determination of our financial position and results of operations.\nAllowance for Loan Losses (allowance). Our management assesses the adequacy of the allowance prior to the end of each calendar quarter. This assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance. The level of the allowance is based upon management's evaluation of the loan portfolio, loan loss experience, asset quality trends, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers' ability to repay the loan (including the timing of future payment), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors, including regulatory recommendations. The level of allowance maintained is believed by management to be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries of amounts previously charged-off. Allocation of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management's judgment, is deemed to be uncollectible.\nOur allowance for loan losses is composed of the result of two independent analyses pursuant to the provisions of ASC 450-20, Loss Contingencies and ASC 310-10-35, Receivables. The ASC 450-20 analysis is intended to quantify the inherent risks in our performing loan portfolio. The ASC 310-10-35 analysis includes a loan-by-loan analysis of impaired loans, both those reported as nonaccrual and troubled-debt restructurings.\nIn assessing the adequacy of the allowance, we also consider the results of our ongoing independent loan review process. We undertake this process both to ascertain those loans in the portfolio with elevated credit risk and to assist in our overall evaluation of the risk characteristics of the entire loan portfolio. Our loan review process includes the judgment of management, independent internal loan reviewers, and reviews that may have been conducted by third-party reviewers primarily regulatory examiners. We incorporate relevant loan review results in the allowance.\nThe ASC 450-20 component of the allowance for loan losses begins with a migration analysis based on our internal system of risk rating, if applicable, and historical loss data in our portfolio, by loan type. The migration analysis accumulates losses realized over a rolling four-quarter cycle and is utilized to determine an annual loss rate for each category for each quarter-end in our look-back period. The look-back period in our migration analysis includes 24 quarters as we believe this period is representative of an economic cycle. The loss rates for each category are then averaged and applied to the end of period loan portfolio balances to determine estimated losses. The estimated losses by category are then adjusted by a specifically-determined loss emergence period for each type of loan in our portfolio. A loss emergence period represents the length of time from the initial event which triggered the loss to the recognition of the loss by Pinnacle Bank. Combined, the loss rates and loss emergence period provide a quantitative estimate of credit losses inherent in our end of period loan portfolio based on our actual loss experience.\nThe estimated loan loss allocation for all loan segments also considers management's estimate of probable losses for a number of qualitative factors that have not been considered in the loan migration analysis. The qualitative categories and the measurements used to quantify the risks within each of these categories are subjectively selected by management, but measured by objective measurements period over period. The data for each measurement may be obtained from internal or external sources. The current period measurements are evaluated and assigned a factor commensurate with the current level of risk relative to past measurements over time. The resulting factor is applied to the non-impaired loan portfolio. This amount represents estimated probable inherent credit losses which exist, but have not yet been identified either in our risk rating or impairment process, as of the balance sheet date, and is based upon quarterly trend assessments in portfolio concentrations, policy exceptions, economic conditions, staff performance, independent loan review results, collateral considerations, credit quality, competition and regulatory requirements, enterprise wide risk assessments, and peer group credit quality. The qualitative allowance allocation, as determined by the processes noted above, is increased or decreased for each loan segment based on the assessment of these various qualitative factors.\nThe allowance for loan losses for purchased loans is calculated similar to that utilized for our legacy loans. Our accounting policy is to compare the computed allowance for loan losses for purchased loans to any remaining fair value adjustment on a loan-by-loan basis. If the computed allowance is greater than the remaining fair value adjustment, the excess is added to the allowance for loan losses by a provision for loan losses.\nThe ASC 450-20 portion of the allowance also includes a small unallocated component. We believe that the unallocated amount is warranted for inherent factors that cannot be practically assigned to individual loan categories, such as the imprecision in the overall loss allocation measurement process, the subjectivity risk of not considering all relevant environmental categories and related measurements and imprecision in our credit risk ratings process. The appropriateness of the unallocated component of the allowance is assessed each quarter end based upon changes in the overall business environment not otherwise captured.\nThe second component of the allowance for loan losses is determined pursuant to ASC 310-10-35. Loans are impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Collection of all amounts due according to the contractual terms means collecting all interest and principal payments of a loan as scheduled in the loan agreement. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change. Loan losses are charged off when management believes that the full collectability of the loan is unlikely. A loan may be partially charged-off after a \"confirming event\" has occurred which serves to validate that full repayment pursuant to the terms of the loan is unlikely.\nAn impairment allowance is recognized if the fair value of the loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan (recorded investment in the loan is the principal balance plus any accrued interest, net of deferred loan fees or costs and unamortized premium or discount). The impairment is recognized through the provision for loan losses and is a component of the allowance. Loans that are impaired are recorded at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, or if the loan is collateral dependent, at the fair value of the collateral, less estimated disposal costs. If the loan is collateral dependent, the principal balance of the loan is charged-off in an amount equal to the impairment measurement. The fair value of collateral dependent loans is derived primarily from collateral appraisals performed by independent third-party appraisers. Management believes it follows appropriate accounting and regulatory guidance in determining impairment and accrual status of impaired loans.\nPursuant to the guidance set forth in ASU No. 2011-02, A Creditor's Determination of Whether a Restructuring is a Troubled Debt Restructuring, the above impairment methodology is also applied to those loans identified as troubled debt restructurings.\nWe then test the resulting allowance by comparing the balance in the allowance to historical trends and industry and peer information. Our management then evaluates the result of the procedures performed, including the results of our testing, and decides on the appropriateness of the balance of the allowance in its entirety. The audit committee of our board of directors approves the allowance for loan loss policy annually and reviews the methodology and approves the resultant allowance prior to the filing of quarterly and annual financial information.\nWhile our policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for loan losses, as well as the resultant provision for loan losses charged to operations, are considered adequate by management and are reviewed from time to time by our regulators, they are necessarily approximate and inherently imprecise. There are factors beyond our control, such as conditions in the local, national, and international economy, a local real estate market or particular industry conditions which may negatively impact materially our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and thus the resulting provision for loan losses.\nOther Real Estate Owned. Other real estate owned (OREO), which consists of properties obtained through foreclosure or through deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of loans, is reported at fair value based on appraised value less selling costs, estimated as of the date acquired, with any loss recognized as a charge-off through the allowance for loan losses. Additional OREO losses for subsequent downward valuation adjustments are determined on a specific property basis and are included as a component of other noninterest expense along with holding costs. The fair value of other real estate owned is derived primarily from independent appraisers. Our internal policies generally require OREO properties to be appraised every nine months. Any net gains or losses on disposal realized at the time of disposal are reflected, net, in noninterest income or noninterest expense, as applicable. Significant judgments and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of other real estate owned, and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility, as experienced during the last few years. As a result, the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates used to determine the fair value of other real estate owned.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets. Long-lived assets, including purchased intangible assets subject to amortization, such as our core deposit intangible asset, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. There are no such assets to be disposed of at December 31, 2016.\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment annually and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Our annual assessment date is September 30. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset's fair value.\nASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, regarding testing goodwill for impairment provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity does a qualitative assessment and determines it is necessary, or if a qualitative assessment is not performed, it is required to perform a two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit (if any). If, based on a qualitative assessment, an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. The results of our qualitative assessment indicated that the fair value of our reporting unit was more than its carrying value, and accordingly, the two-step goodwill impairment test was not performed.\nShould our common stock price decline or other impairment indicators become known, additional impairment testing of goodwill may be required. Should it be determined in a future period that the goodwill has become impaired, then a charge to earnings will be recorded in the period such determination is made. While we believe that the assumptions utilized in our testing were appropriate, they may not reflect actual outcomes that could occur. Specific factors that could negatively impact the assumptions used include the following: a change in the control premium being realized in the market or a meaningful change in the number of mergers and acquisitions occurring; the amount of expense savings that may be realized in an acquisition scenario; significant fluctuations in our asset/liability balances or the composition of our balance sheet; a change in the overall valuation of the stock market, specifically bank stocks; performance of Southeast U.S. Banks; and Pinnacle Financial's performance relative to peers. Changing these assumptions, or any other key assumptions, could have a material impact on the amount of goodwill impairment, if any.\nResults of Operations\nThe following is a summary of our results of operations for 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands except per share data):\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Years ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2016-2015\nPercent\nIncrease\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2015-2014\nPercent\nIncrease\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 363,609\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 255,169\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 42.50\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 206,170\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 23.77\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 38,615\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18,537\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 108.31\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 13,185\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 40.59\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 324,994\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 236,632\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 37.34\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 192,985\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 22.62\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18,328\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,188\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 99.47\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,635\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 152.80\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income after provision for loan losses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 306,666\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 227,444\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 34.83\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 189,350\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 20.12\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 121,003\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 86,530\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 39.84\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 52,602\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 64.50\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 236,285\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 170,877\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 38.28\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 136,300\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25.37\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 191,383\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 143,098\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 33.74\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 105,653\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 35.44\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 64,159\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 47,589\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 34.82\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 35,182\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 35.27\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 127,224\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 95,509\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 33.21\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 70,471\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 35.53\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic net income per common share\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.96\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.58\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14.73\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.03\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 27.09\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted net income per common share\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.91\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.52\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15.48\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.01\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25.37\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income represents the amount by which interest earned on various earning assets exceeds interest paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities and is the most significant component of our revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded net interest income of approximately $325.0 million, which resulted in a net interest margin of 3.70%. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded net interest income of approximately $236.6 million, which resulted in a net interest margin of 3.72%. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded net interest income of approximately $193.0 million, which resulted in a net interest margin of 3.75%.\nThe following table sets forth the amount of our average balances, interest income or interest expense for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the average interest rate for total interest-earning assets and total interest-bearing liabilities, net interest spread and net interest margin for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 51: <table> <tr>

Our loan yields grew only slightly between 2016 and 2015 as the competition for quality loans is intense and the market dictates the rate necessary in order to grow volumes, but were further positively impacted by the accretion of the fair value marks recorded in conjunction with our acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2016, total funding rates were more than those rates for the year ended December 31, 2015 by 15 basis points and were more than those rates for the year ended December 31, 2014 by 3 basis points. The net increase was impacted by our acquisitions as their deposit rates were higher, interest rate increases, increased FHLB borrowings, and our subordinated debt issuances during 2016. The subordinated debt instruments qualify as Tier 2 capital.\nWe continue to deploy various asset liability management strategies to manage our risk to interest rate fluctuations. We believe margin expansion over both the short and the long term will be challenging due to continued pressure on earning asset yields during this extended period of a low interest rates. Loan pricing for creditworthy borrowers is very competitive in our markets and has limited our ability to increase pricing on new and renewed loans over the last couple of years. We anticipate that this challenging competitive environment will continue in 2017. However, we believe our net interest income should increase in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in average earning asset volumes, primarily loans, as well as the incremental amounts attributable for Avenue. We anticipate funding these increased earning assets by continuing to grow our core deposits, with wholesale and other forms of noncore funding limited to that required to fund the shortfall, if any.\nRate and Volume Analysis. Net interest income increased by $88.4 million between the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 and by $43.6 million between the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015.

on which interest is received or paid. Volume change is calculated as change in volume times the previous rate while rate change is change in rate times the previous volume. The change attributed to rates and volumes (change in rate times change in volume) is considered above as a change in volume.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for loan losses that, in management's evaluation, we believe to be adequate to provide coverage for the inherent losses on outstanding loans. The provision for loan losses amounted to approximately $18.3 million, $9.2 million, and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nImpacting the provision for loan losses in any accounting period are several factors including the change in outstanding loan balances, the level of charge-offs and recoveries, the changes in the amount of impaired loans, changes in the risk ratings assigned to our loans, results of regulatory examinations, credit quality comparison to peer banks, the industry at large, and, ultimately, the results of our quarterly assessment of the inherent risks of our loan portfolio including past loan loss experience.\nProvision expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 has increased as compared to 2015, primarily due to increased charge-offs in our consumer portfolio, primarily related to automobile loans, although the overall amount of the allowance declined. Provision expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased as compared to 2014, primarily due to increased charge-offs in our consumer portfolio, although the overall amount of the allowance declined.\nOur allowance for loan losses is adjusted to an amount deemed appropriate to adequately cover probable losses in the loan portfolio based on our allowance for loan loss methodology. Our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans decreased from 1.00% at December 31, 2015 to 0.70% at December 31, 2016, primarily attributable to improvements in the credit quality of our legacy Pinnacle Bank portfolio and as a result of our acquired loan portfolios being recorded at fair value upon acquisition, thus no allowance for loan losses is assigned to these loans as of the date of acquisition. An allowance for loan losses is recorded for purchased loans that have experienced credit deterioration subsequent to acquisition or increases in balances outstanding. As of December 31, 2016, net loans included a net fair value discount of $34.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, the net fair value discount changed as follows:\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\nAccretable Yield </td> <td> </td> <td>\nNonaccretable Yield </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nTotal </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2014 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> - </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> - </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> - </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisitions / Day 1 adjustments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (28,289 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (5,703 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (33,992 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year-to-date accretion/settlement\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,077 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,560 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,637 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> - </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> - </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> - </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(23,212 </td> <td>) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,143 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> (27,355 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisitions / Day 1 adjustments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27,036 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (812 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (27,848 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year-to-date accretion/settlement\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19,884 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,322 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 21,206 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> - </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> - </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> (30,364 </td> <td>) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,633 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> (33,997 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased upon our evaluation of the loan portfolio, we believe the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to absorb our estimate of inherent losses existing in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2016. While our policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for loan losses, as well as the resultant provision for loan losses charged to operations, are considered adequate by management, they are necessarily approximate and imprecise. There are factors beyond our control, such as conditions in the local and national economy, local real estate market or a particular industry or borrower which may negatively impact, materially, our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and, thus, the resulting provision for loan losses.\nNoninterest Income. Our noninterest income is composed of several components, some of which vary significantly between annual periods. Service charges on deposit accounts and other noninterest income generally reflect our growth, while investment services, fees from the origination of mortgage loans, swap fees and gains on the sale of securities will often reflect market conditions and fluctuate from period to period.\nThe following is our noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Years ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2016-2015\nPercent\nIncrease\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2015-2014\nPercent\nIncrease\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest income:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service charges on deposit accounts\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,501\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,746\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 13.77\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,707\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 8.88\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,757\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,971\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 7.88\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,383\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 6.27\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Insurance sales commissions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,309\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,824\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 10.05\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,613\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 4.57\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gains on mortgage loans sold, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15,754\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,669\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 105.42\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,630\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 36.22\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment gains on sales and impairments, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (28.44\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> NM\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Trust fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,328\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,461\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 15.88\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,601\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 18.69\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from equity method investment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 31,403\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 20,591\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 52.51\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> NM\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other noninterest income:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interchange and other consumer fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 24,221\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18,214\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 32.98\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,322\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 47.82\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bank-owned life insurance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,547\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,548\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 39.21\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,426\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 5.03\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan swap fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,865\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,578\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 49.92\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> NM\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other noninterest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,923\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,376\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 257.78\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,656\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (16.91\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other noninterest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 36,556\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 24,716\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 47.90\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 16,639\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 48.54\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total noninterest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 121,003\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 86,530\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 39.84\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52,602\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 64.50\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in service charges on deposit accounts in 2016 compared to 2015 and 2014 is primarily related to increased analysis fees on our commercial client accounts and for both periods presented, an increase in our deposit base when compared the prior period, respectively.\nIncome from our wealth management groups (investments, insurance and trust) is also included in noninterest income. For the year ended December 31, 2016, commissions and fees from investment services at our financial advisory unit, Pinnacle Asset Management, a division of Pinnacle Bank were $10.8 million, compared to $10.0 million at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, Pinnacle Asset Management was receiving commissions and fees in connection with approximately $2.2 billion in brokerage assets held with Raymond James Financial Services, Inc. compared to $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2015 and 2014. Insurance commissions were approximately $5.3 million during 2016 and $4.8 million during 2015 and $4.6 million during 2014. Additionally, at December 31, 2016, our trust department was receiving fees on approximately $1.0 billion and $755 million of managed and custodied assets, respectively, compared to approximately $916 million and $675 million at December 31, 2015 and $765 million and $861 million at December 31, 2014.\nGains on mortgage loans sold, net, consists of fees from the origination and sale of residential mortgage loans. These mortgage fees are for loans originated in our current markets that are subsequently sold to third-party investors. Substantially all of these loan sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer. Generally, mortgage origination fees increase in lower interest rate environments and more robust housing markets and decrease in rising interest rate environments and more challenging housing markets. Mortgage origination fees will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as the rate environment changes. Gains on mortgage loans sold, net, were $15.8 million, $7.7 million and $5.6 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The increase between each of the periods is attributable to the strong economy in our markets, the continued low interest rate environment and additional personnel in our production unit in 2016 when compared to 2015 and 2014. We hedge a portion of our mortgage pipeline as part of a mandatory delivery program. There is a strong positive correlation between the size of the mortgage pipeline and the value of this hedge. The hedge is not designated as a hedge for GAAP purposes and, as such, changes in its fair value are recorded directly thru the income statement. Therefore, the size of the outstanding mortgage pipeline at any reporting period will directly impact the amount of revenue recorded for mortgage loans held for sale in any one period. During 2016, we realized an increase in the volume of loans included in the mortgage pipeline, and therefore recognized a gain on the change in the fair market value of the hedge. Decreases in the volume of loans included in the mortgage pipeline are likely to negatively impact the gains we recognize as a result of this program.\nIncome from equity-method investment is comprised of income from our 49% equity-method investment in BHG. We acquired a 30% investment during the first quarter of 2015 and subsequently increased our investment by 19% in the first quarter of 2016. Income from this equity-method investment was $31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Income from equity-method investment is recorded net of associated expenses, including amortization expense associated with customer lists and other intangible assets of $3.4 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2016, there were $16.8 million of these intangible assets which will be amortized in lesser amounts over the next 19 years. Also included in income from equity-method investment, is accretion income associated with the fair valuation of certain of BHG's liabilities of $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, while no accretion income was recorded in 2015. At December 31, 2016, there were $18.1 million of these liabilities which will be accreted in lesser amounts over the next 10 years.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank received $29.0 million and $7.2 million in dividends in the aggregate from BHG, which reduced the carrying amount of our investment in BHG while earnings from BHG increase the carrying amount of our investment in BHG. Our proportionate share of earnings from BHG are included in our consolidated tax return. Profits from intercompany transactions are eliminated. Earnings from BHG may fluctuate from period-to-period.\nAs our ownership interest in BHG is 49%, we do not consolidate BHG's results of operations or financial position into our financial statements but record the net result of BHG's activities at our percentage ownership in income from equity method investment in noninterest income. For the year ended December 31, 2016, BHG reported $136.7 million in gross revenues compared to $144.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The following discussion considers BHG's results of operations for 2016 and 2015 prior to consideration of our ownership interest.\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Approximately $95.6 million, or 69.9%, of these revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to gains on the sale of commercial loans BHG had previously issued to doctor, dentist and other medical practices compared to $71.0 million or 49.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015. BHG refers to this activity as its core product. BHG typically funds these loans from cash reserves on its balance sheet. Subsequently, these core product loans are sold with limited or no recourse to BHG to a network of community banks and other financial institutions at a premium to the par value of the loan. The purchaser may access a BHG cash reserve account of up to 3% of the loan balance to support loan payments. BHG retains no servicing or other responsibilities related to the core product loan once sold. As a result, this gain on sale premium represents BHG's compensation for absorbing the costs to originate the loan as well as marketing expenses associated with maintaining its business model. At December 31, 2016, there were $1.2 billion in core product loans previously sold by BHG that were actively serviced by BHG's bank network of purchasers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTraditionally, BHG, at its sole option, may also provide purchasers of these core product loans the ability to substitute the acquired loan with another more recently-issued BHG medical practice loan should the previously-acquired loan become at least 90-days past due as to its monthly payments. This substitution is subject to the purchaser having adhered to the standards of its purchase agreement with BHG. Additionally, all substitutions are subject to the approval by BHG's board of directors. As a result, the reacquired loans are deemed purchase credit impaired and recorded on BHG's balance sheet at the net present value of the loan's anticipated cash flows. BHG will then initiate collection efforts and attempt to restore the reacquired loan to performing status. During 2016, BHG's substitution losses related to these activities totaled approximately $23.4 million. As a result, BHG maintained a liability as of December 31, 2016 of $45.9 million that represents an estimate of the future inherent losses for the outstanding core portfolio that may be subject to future substitution.\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> BHG will maintain loans on its balance sheet for a period of time prior to sale or transfer to a purchaser. BHG also has an investment portfolio on which it earns interest and dividend income. Net interest income and fees associated with this activity amounted to $20.3 million and $18.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Additionally, BHG will also refer loans to other financial institutions and, based an agreement with the institution, earn a fee for doing so. Typically, these are loans that BHG believes would either be classified as consumer-type loans rather than commercial loans, the loans fail to meet the credit underwriting standards of BHG but another institution will accept the loans or these are loans to borrowers in certain geographic locations where BHG has elected not to do business. For the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, BHG recognized fee income of $10.0 million and $7.4 million, respectively, from these activities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncluded in other noninterest income are interchange and other consumer fees, gains from bank-owned life insurance, swap fees earned for the facilitation of derivative transactions for our clients and other items. Interchange revenues increased as a result of increased debit and credit card transactions as compared to the comparable periods in 2015 and 2014 resulting from both acquired and organic growth. As our assets now exceed $10 billion, the interchange revenues we earn will be negatively impacted beginning in the third quarter of 2017 due to the limits on interchange fees permitted under the Durbin Amendment of the Dodd-Frank Act. Other noninterest income included changes in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance which was $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in earnings on these bank-owned life insurance policies resulted primarily from the additional $66.7 million in bank-owned life insurance with terms similar to our existing policies which were added upon acquisition of Avenue. The assets that support these policies are administered by the life insurance carriers and the income we receive (i.e., increases or decreases in the cash surrender value of the policies) on these policies is dependent upon the returns the insurance carriers are able to earn on the underlying investments that support the policies. Earnings on these policies generally are not taxable. Loan swap fees are also included in other noninterest income and increased by $1.3 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and by $2.3 million between 2015 and 2014 as a result of increased market demand for these products in the current rate environment.\nNoninterest Expense.

total salaries and employee benefits expense in 2016 over 2015 and 2014 is primarily the result of an increase in the number of employees in 2016 over 2015 and 2014. At December 31, 2016, our associate base had expanded to 1,179.5 full-time equivalent associates as compared to 1,058.5 and 764.0 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily resulting from our acquisitions of CapitalMark, Magna and Avenue. We expect salary and employee benefit expenses will continue to rise as we continue to hire more experienced bankers throughout our expanded footprint and if we are able to consummate our proposed acquisition of BNC. Moreover, as we increase in size and now exceed $10 billion in total assets, we also expect our compliance costs, FDIC insurance assessment expense and salaries and benefits costs to increase.\nWe believe that cash and equity incentives are a valuable tool in motivating an employee base that is focused on providing our clients effective financial advice and increasing shareholder value. As a result, and unlike many other financial institutions, all of our non-commissioned associates participate in our annual cash incentive plan, and all of our associates participate in our equity compensation plans. Under the annual cash incentive plan, the targeted level of incentive payments requires achievement of a certain soundness threshold and a targeted level of revenues and earnings (subject to certain adjustments). To the extent that the soundness threshold is met and revenues and earnings are above or below the targeted amount, the aggregate incentive payments are increased or decreased. Historically, we have paid between 0% and 125% of our targeted incentives. In 2016, our cash incentives represented 90% of targeted incentive compensation compared to 100% in 2015 and 123% in 2014.\nEmployee benefits and other expenses include costs associated with our 401k plan, health insurance, and payroll taxes. Also, included in employee benefits and other expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, were approximately $11.0 million, $7.3 million and $5.3 million, respectively, of compensation expenses related to equity-based awards, for restricted shares or restricted share units, including those with performance-based vesting criteria. We have not issued stock options since 2008.\nEquipment and occupancy expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 28.7% greater than in 2015 which was 13.1% greater than in 2014, primarily due to the locations acquired upon our mergers with Avenue, CapitalMark and Magna. Additionally, one branch was added in the Knoxville MSA in each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016. We intend to expand our footprint by one location in each of the Knoxville, Chattanooga, and Memphis MSAs annually. In future periods, these expansions may lead to higher equipment and occupancy expenses as well as related increases in salaries benefits expense.\nMarketing and business development expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 34.4% greater than in 2015 which was 17.8% greater than in 2014. The primary source of the increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 is related to our advertising and banking sponsorships with a professional sports franchise in Memphis, which was entered into during 2016.\nNoninterest expense related to the amortization of intangibles was $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $2.0 million and $948,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The following table outlines our amortizing intangible assets and the related amortizable life of our acquired intangible assets:\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year\nacquired\n</td> <td> Initial\nValuation\n(in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Amortizable\nLife\n(in years)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Core Deposit Intangible:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mid-America\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9.5\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CapitalMark\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 6.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Magna Bank\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 3.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Avenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 8.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Book of Business Intangible:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Miller Loughry Beach\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CapitalMark Trust\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese assets are being amortized on an accelerated basis which reflects the anticipated life of the underlying assets. Amortization expense is estimated to decrease from $4.3 million to $1.3 million per year over the next five years with lesser amounts for the remaining amortization period.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, merger-related charges of $11.7 million and $4.8 million were incurred associated with our acquisitions of Avenue, CapitalMark and Magna. Merger expense during 2016 includes legal costs incurred associated with the Avenue merger to defend ourselves and Avenue's directors in a shareholder suit as well as investigation and other legal costs associated with a former director's alleged improper trading in Avenue common stock. Merger expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, also includes the costs of technical conversions which were completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 for Magna, in the first quarter of 2016 for CapitalMark and in the third quarter of 2016 for Avenue. Associate related expenses such as retention bonuses are also included in these expenses. We do not expect any future merger-related charges due to the acquisitions of CapitalMark and Magna, and we do not expect future merger-related charges due to the acquisition of Avenue, if any, to be significant. However, merger-related charges are expected to be incurred related to our proposed acquisition of BNC during 2017.\nTotal other noninterest expenses increased by $10.4 million to $33.5 million during 2016 when compared to 2015. Included in other noninterest expenses are deposit and lending related expenses, investment and trust sales expenses, FHLB restructuring expense and administrative expenses. Lending expenses increased by $4.3 million primarily as a result of our expanding credit card platform. Administrative and other expenses increased by $3.0 million to $11.9 million during 2016 when compared to 2015. Included in those expenses was an increase of $893,000 in the loss on foreclosed other repossessed assets. Franchise tax expense increased approximately $2.0 million as compared to 2015 as a result of state income tax credits being applied to excise tax in 2016 as compared to franchise tax in 2015. Total other noninterest expenses increased by $7.4 million to $23.2 million during 2015 when compared to 2014. Included in other noninterest expenses are deposit and lending related expenses, investment and trust sales expenses, FHLB restructuring expense and administrative expenses. Lending expenses increased by $3.5 million primarily as a result of our expanding credit card platform and the resulting third-party processing expenses. Administrative and other expenses increased by $2.8 million to $8.9 million during 2015 when compared to 2014. We incurred increases of approximately $1.2 million in regulatory expenses, director fees, legal costs, data processing expenses and insurance expenses primarily as a result of our CapitalMark and Magna acquisitions. We also incurred increases in franchise tax expense of approximately $544,000 due to increased franchise and excise tax obligations resulting from the complete utilization of our state net operating loss. We also experienced an increase of $402,000 in losses on other repossessed assets.\nOur efficiency ratio (ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income) was 53.0% in fiscal year 2016 compared to 52.9% in fiscal year 2015 and 55.5% in fiscal year 2014. The efficiency ratio measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue.\nIncome Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2016, Pinnacle Financial recorded income tax expense of $64.2 million. Our effective income tax rate was 33.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 33.3% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, which is principally impacted by our investments in bank-qualified municipal securities, our real estate investment trust, participation in the Tennessee CITC program, and bank-owned life insurance, offset in part by the limitation on deductibility of meals and entertainment expense and certain merger-related expenses. In the event the federal corporate tax rate decreases, as is currently being discussed in Congress, we would be required to write down the value of our deferred tax asset, which would negatively impact income tax expense. Our net deferred tax assets were $49.8 million at December 31, 2016.\nFinancial Condition\nOur consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016 reflects an increase of $1.907 billion in outstanding loans to $8.450 billion and an increase of $1.788 billion in total deposits to $8.759 billion from December 31, 2015. Total assets were $11.195 billion at December 31, 2016 as compared to $8.715 billion at December 31, 2015. We acquired loans of $952.5 million and deposits totaling $966.7 million upon our acquisition of Avenue in 2016. Collectively, we acquired $1.298 billion in loans and $1.406 billion in deposits upon our acquisitions of CapitalMark and Magna in 2015.\nLoans. The composition of loans at December 31 for each of the past five years and the percentage (%) of each segment to total loans are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial real estate - Mortgage\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,193,496\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 37.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,275,483\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 34.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,544,091\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 33.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,383,435\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 33.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,178,196\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 31.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer real estate - Mortgage\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,185,917\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 14.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,046,517\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 16.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 721,158\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 15.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 695,616\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 16.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 679,926\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 18.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Construction and land development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 912,673\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 10.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 747,697\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 11.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 322,466\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 7.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 316,191\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 7.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 313,552\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 8.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial and industrial\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,891,710\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 34.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,228,542\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 34.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,784,729\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 38.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,605,547\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 38.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,446,578\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 39.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer and other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 266,129\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 3.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 244,996\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 3.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 217,583\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 4.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 143,704\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 3.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 93,910\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,449,925\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,543,235\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,590,027\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,144,493\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,712,162\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have experienced growth in all segments of our portfolio. At December 31, 2016, our loan portfolio composition remained relatively consistent with the composition at December 31, 2015. Despite the acquisitions that were completed during 2015 and 2016, we believe that loan growth in 2017 in the commercial real estate - mortgage segment will outpace loan payoffs in that segment of the portfolio resulting in an increase in the percentage of commercial real estate - mortgage loans as a percentage of total loans. The commercial real estate - mortgage category includes owner-occupied commercial real estate loans. At December 31, 2016, approximately 42.4% of the outstanding principal balance of our commercial real estate - mortgage loans was secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate properties. Owner-occupied commercial real estate is similar in many ways to our commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses on the basis of the cash flows of the business rather than on the valuation of the real estate. Growth in the construction and development loan segment reflects the development of the local economies in which we operate and is diversified between commercial, residential and land.\nThe following table classifies our fixed and variable rate loans at December 31, 2016 according to contractual maturities of (1) one year or less, (2) after one year through five years, and (3) after five years. The table also classifies our variable rate loans pursuant to the contractual repricing dates of the underlying loans (dollars in thousands):\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Amounts at December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Fixed\nRates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Variable\nRates(*)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Totals\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> At December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> At December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Based on contractual maturity:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Due within one year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 382,387\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,389,574\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,771,961\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 21.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 20.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Due in one year to five years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,051,012\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,904,829\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,955,841\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 46.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 46.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Due after five years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 997,684\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,724,439\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,722,123\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 32.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 33.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Totals\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,431,083\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,018,842\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,449,925\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Based on contractual repricing dates:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Daily floating rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,008,804\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,008,804\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 23.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 21.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Due within one year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 382,387\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,656,928\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,039,315\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 36.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 33.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Due in one year to five years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,051,012\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 298,603\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,349,615\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 27.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 29.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Due after five years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 997,684\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 54,507\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,052,191\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 15.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Totals\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,431,083\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,018,842\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,449,925\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe above information does not consider the impact of scheduled principal payments.\n(*)Daily floating rate loans are tied to Pinnacle Bank's prime lending rate or a national interest rate index with the underlying loan rates changing in relation to changes in these indexes. Included in variable rate loans are $469 million of loans which are currently priced at their contractual floors with a weighted average rate of 4.55%. The weighted average contractual rate on these loans is 3.86% As a result, interest income on these loans will not change until the contractual rate on the underlying loan exceeds the interest rate floor.\nLoan Origination Risk Management. We maintain lending policies and procedures designed to maximize lending opportunities within an acceptable level of risk. Management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis. A reporting system supplements the review process by providing management with frequent reports related to loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies and non-performing loans. Diversification in the loan portfolio is measured and monitored as a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions.\nUnderwriting standards are designed to promote relationship banking rather than transactional banking. Management examines current and projected cash flows to determine the expected ability of a borrower to repay its obligations as agreed. Commercial and industrial loans are primarily underwritten based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and generally are collateralized by business assets and may have a personal guaranty of business principals. Collateral pledged may include the assets being financed or other assets such as accounts receivable, inventory or equipment. Some short-term loans may be advanced on an unsecured basis.\nCommercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and are underwritten based on the ability of the property (in the case of income producing property), or the borrower's business (if owner occupied) to generate sufficient cash flow to amortize the debt. Secondary emphasis is placed upon collateral value and the financial strength of guarantors, if any. Commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. As detailed in the discussion of real estate loans below, the properties securing our commercial real estate portfolio generally are diverse in terms of type and industry and we measure and monitor concentrations regularly. We believe this diversity helps reduce our exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single industry or type of real estate product. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on cash flow, collateral, geography and risk grade criteria. We also utilize third-party experts to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting market areas we serve.\nGiven the positive economic outlook for our current geographic markets, we continue to make loans for commercial construction and development projects. Construction loans are underwritten utilizing independent appraisals, sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates, financial analysis of the developers and property owners, and expectations of the permanent mortgage market, among other items. Construction loans are generally based upon estimates of costs and appraised value associated with the completed project, which may be inaccurate. Construction loans involve the disbursement of funds during construction with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project. Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be sales of developed property, refinancing in the permanent mortgage market, or an interim loan commitment from us until permanent financing is obtained. These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans because their ultimate repayment depends on the satisfactory completion of construction and is sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, general economic conditions and the availability of long-term financing.\nWe also originate consumer loans, including consumer real-estate loans, where we typically use a computer-based credit scoring analysis to supplement the underwriting process. To monitor and manage consumer loan risk, policies and procedures are developed and modified, as needed, jointly by line and staff personnel. This activity, coupled with relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers, seeks to minimize risk. Additionally, trend and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis. Underwriting standards for home equity loans are heavily influenced by statutory requirements.\nWe also maintain an independent loan review department that reviews and validates the credit risk program on a periodic basis. Results of these reviews are presented to management and the audit committee. The loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel, as well as our policies and procedures.\nLending Concentrations. We periodically analyze our commercial loan portfolio to determine if a concentration of credit risk exists to any one or more industries. We use broadly accepted industry classification systems in order to classify borrowers into various industry classifications. We have a credit exposure (loans outstanding plus unfunded commitments) exceeding 25% of Pinnacle Bank's total risk-based capital to borrowers in the following industries at December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> At December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Outstanding Principal Balances\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Unfunded Commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total exposure\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total Exposure at December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lessors of nonresidential buildings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,294,366\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 407,487\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,701,853\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,078,211\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lessors of residential buildings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 526,259\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 347,975\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 874,234\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 500,266\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New housing operative builders\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 229,035\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 157,370\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 386,405\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 206,538\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hotels and motels\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 127,296\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 164,569\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 291,865\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 167,317\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPerforming Loans in Past Due Status.

Potential problem loans amounted to approximately $114.6 million, or 1.4% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2016, compared to $105.0 million, or 1.6% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2015. Potential problem loans, which are not included in nonperforming loans, represent those loans with a well-defined weakness and where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have doubts about the borrower's ability to comply with present repayment terms. This definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by Pinnacle Bank's primary regulators, for loans classified as substandard or worse, but not considered nonperforming loans. Approximately $4.5 million of potential problem loans were past due at least 30 but less than 90 days as of December 31, 2016.\nNon-Performing Assets and Troubled Debt Restructurings. At December 31, 2016, we had $33.7 million in nonperforming assets compared to $36.3 million at December 31, 2015. Included in nonperforming assets were $27.6 million in nonperforming loans and $6.1 million in other real estate owned at December 31, 2016 and $29.3 million in nonperforming loans and $7.0 million in other real estate owned at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, there were $15.0 million and $8.1 million, respectively, of troubled debt restructurings that were performing as of the restructured date and remain in a performing status.\nAll nonaccruing loans are reassigned to a special assets officer who was not responsible for originating the loan. The special assets officer is responsible for developing an action plan designed to minimize our future losses. Typically, these special assets officers review our loan files, interview prior officers assigned to the relationship, meet with borrowers, inspect collateral, reappraise collateral and/or consult with legal counsel. The special assets officer then recommends an action plan to a committee of senior associates including lenders and workout specialists, which could include foreclosing on collateral, restructuring the loan, issuing demand letters or other actions.\nWe discontinue the accrual of interest income when (1) there is a significant deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower and full repayment of principal and interest is not expected or (2) the principal or interest is more than 90 days past due, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, we recognized $159,000, $308,000 and $256,000 of interest income from nonperforming loans, reflecting cash payments received from the borrower and our belief, at the time of payment, that the underlying collateral supported the carrying amount of the loans.\nDue to the weakening credit status of a borrower, we may elect to formally restructure certain loans to facilitate a repayment plan that seeks to minimize the potential losses, if any, that we might incur. These loans are considered troubled debt restructurings. If on nonaccruing status as of the date of restructuring, any restructured loan is included in the nonperforming loan balances as discussed above and is classified as an impaired loan. Loans that have been restructured that are on accrual status as of the restructure date are not included in nonperforming loans; however, such loans are still considered impaired.\nAt December 31, 2016, we owned $6.1 million in other real estate which we had acquired, usually through foreclosure, from borrowers compared to $5.1 million at December 31, 2015; the majority of this real estate is located within our principal markets. We categorize other real estate owned into three types: developed lots, undeveloped land, and other. Included in the \"other\" category are primarily condominiums, office buildings and residential homes that are not new construction. The following table shows the amounts of our other real estate owned in such categories (in thousands):\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Developed lots\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,656\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 1,748\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Undeveloped land\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,912\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,830\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,522\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,505\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,090\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,083\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table is a summary of our nonperforming assets and troubled debt restructurings at December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> At\nDecember 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> At\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonperforming assets:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonperforming loans (1):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial real estate -

We maintain the allowance at a level that our management deems appropriate to adequately cover the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2016, and 2015, our allowance for loan losses was $59.0 million and $65.4 million, respectively, which our management deemed to be adequate at each of the respective dates. The decrease in the allowance for loan losses in 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily the result of improving credit metrics within our portfolio, including the reduction in net charge-offs and an increase in our coverage ratio. Our allowance for loan loss as a percentage of total loans has decreased from 1.00% at December 31, 2015 to 0.70% at December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of recording acquired portfolios at fair value upon acquisition. The allowance for loan losses for purchased loans is calculated similar to that utilized for legacy Pinnacle Bank loans. Pinnacle Financial's accounting policy is to compare the computed allowance for loan losses for purchased loans to the remaining fair value adjustment. If the computed allowance at the loan level is greater than the remaining fair value adjustment, the excess is added to the allowance for loan losses by a charge to the provision for loan losses. The judgments and estimates associated with our allowance determination are described under \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" above.\nThe following table sets forth, based on management's best estimate, the allocation of the allowance to types of loans as well as the unallocated portion as of December 31 for each of the past five years and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans (in thousands):\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> At December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial real estate - Mortgage\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,655\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 37.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,513\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 34.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,202\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 33.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,372\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 33.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,634\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 31.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer real estate - Mortgage\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,564\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 14.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,220\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 16.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,424\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 15.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,355\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 16.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,762\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 18.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Construction and land development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,624\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 10.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,903\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 11.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,724\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 7.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,235\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 7.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,164\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 8.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial and industrial\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 24,743\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 34.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 23,643\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 34.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 29,167\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 38.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25,134\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 38.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 24,738\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 39.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer and other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,520\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 3.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15,616\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 3.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,570\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 4.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,632\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 3.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,094\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> NA\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> NA\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,272\n</td> <td> NA\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,242\n</td> <td> NA\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,025\n</td> <td> NA\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total allowance for loan losses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 58,980\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 65,432\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,359\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,970\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 69,417\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in the overall allowance for loan losses is due to the improvement in the larger segments of our loan portfolio, which is largely influenced by the overall improvement in the economy in our current geographic markets. Net charge-offs in the consumer portfolio have remained elevated in 2016, primarily due to the non-prime automobile portfolio. The balance of the non-prime automobile portfolio continues to decrease period over period. The allocation by category is determined based on the assigned risk rating, if applicable, and qualitative factors applicable to each category of loans. For impaired loans, those loans are reviewed for a specific allowance allocation. Specific valuation allowances related to impaired loans were approximately $1.1 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $5.2 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily related to the resolution of impaired loans with a specific allowance in 2016. The unallocated category is intended to allow for losses that are inherent in our portfolio that we have not yet identified or attributable to a specific risk factor and for modeling imprecision.

This assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance. The level of the allowance is based upon management's evaluation of the loan portfolios, past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, the views of Pinnacle Bank's regulators, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay (including the timing of future payments), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, historical loss experience, industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change.\nInvestments. Our investment portfolio, consisting primarily of Federal agency bonds, state and municipal securities and mortgage-backed securities, amounted to $1.323 billion and $966.4 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our investment to asset ratio has increased slightly from 11.1% at December 31, 2015 to 11.8% at December 31, 2016. Our investment portfolio serves many purposes including serving as a stable source of income, collateral for public funds and as a potential liquidity source.\nA summary of certain aspects of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2016 and 2015 follows:\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average life\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 5.26 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4.90 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effective duration\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3.16\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3.04\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average coupon\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.85\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3.04\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tax equivalent yield\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.42\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.45\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows the carrying value of investment securities according to contractual maturity classifications of (1) one year or less, (2) after one year through five years, (3) after five years through ten years, and (4) after ten years. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities of mortgage-backed securities because the mortgages underlying the securities may be called or prepaid with or without penalty.

accretion or subtracting premium amortization, as appropriate, on a ratable basis over the life of each security. We computed the weighted average yield for each maturity range using the acquisition price of each security in that range.\nDeposits and Other Borrowings. We had approximately $6.971 billion of deposits at December 31, 2015 compared to $8.759 billion at December 31, 2016. Our deposits consist of noninterest and interest-bearing demand accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and time deposits. Additionally, we entered into agreements with certain customers to sell certain of our securities under agreements to repurchase the security the following day. These agreements (which are typically associated with comprehensive treasury management programs for our commercial clients and provide the client with short-term returns for their excess funds) amounted to $85.7 million at December 31, 2016 and $79.1 million at December 31, 2015. Additionally, at December 31, 2016, we had borrowed $406.3 million in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (FHLB Cincinnati) compared to $300.3 million at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, we had an estimated $1.432 billion in additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB Cincinnati; however, incremental borrowings are made via a formal request by us and the subsequent approval by the FHLB Cincinnati.\nGenerally, we have classified our funding as core funding or non-core funding. Core funding consists of all deposits other than time deposits issued in denominations of $250,000 or greater. All other funding is deemed to be non-core. Non-core is further segmented between relationship based non-core funding and wholesale funding.

Periodically, we may exceed our policy limitations, at which time management will develop plans to bring our core funding ratios back within compliance. As noted in the table above, our core funding as a percentage of total funding decreased from 84.5% at December 31, 2015 to 81.6% at December 31, 2016. Continuing to grow our core deposit base is a key strategic objective of our firm. Our current growth plans contemplate that we may increase our non-core funding amounts from current levels, but we do not currently anticipate that such increases will exceed our internal policies.\nWhen wholesale funding is necessary to complement the company's core deposit base, management determines which source is best suited to address both liquidity risk management and interest rate risk management objectives. We increased our exposure to brokered deposits in 2016 as a measure to diversify wholesale funding sources. The Asset Liability Management Policy institutes limitations on overall wholesale funding reliance and on brokered deposit exposure specifically. Both our overall reliance on wholesale funding and exposure to brokered deposits were well within those policy limitations as of December 31, 2016.\nThe amount of time deposits as of December 31, 2016 amounted to $836.9 million.

We guarantee the payment of distributions and payments for redemption or liquidation of the Trust Preferred Securities to the extent of funds held by the Trusts. Pinnacle Financial's obligations under the Subordinated Debentures together with the guarantee and other back-up obligations, in the aggregate, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by Pinnacle Financial of the obligations of the Trusts under the Trust Preferred Securities.\nThe Subordinated Debentures are unsecured, bear interest at a rate equal to the rates paid by the Trusts on the Trust Preferred Securities and mature on the same dates as those noted above for the Trust Preferred Securities. Interest is payable quarterly. We may defer the payment of interest at any time for a period not exceeding 20 consecutive quarters provided that the deferral period does not extend past the stated maturity. During any such deferral period, distributions on the Trust Preferred Securities will also be deferred and our ability to pay dividends on our common shares will be restricted.\nThe Trust Preferred Securities may be redeemed prior to maturity at our option. The Trust Preferred Securities may also be redeemed at any time in whole (but not in part) in the event of unfavorable changes in laws or regulations that result in (1) the Trust becoming subject to federal income tax on income received on the Subordinated Debentures, (2) interest payable by the parent company on the Subordinated Debentures becoming non-deductible for federal tax purposes, (3) the requirement for the Trust to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or (4) loss of the ability to treat the Trust Preferred Securities as \"Tier I capital\" under the Federal Reserve capital adequacy guidelines.\nOn July 30, 2015, Pinnacle Bank issued $60.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2025 (Pinnacle Bank Notes) in a private placement transaction to institutional investors.

The Pinnacle Bank Notes issued on March 10, 2016 were priced at 99.023% of the principal amount per note, for an effective interest rate of 5.125%. The maturity date of the Pinnacle Bank Notes is July 30, 2025, although Pinnacle Bank may redeem some or all of the Pinnacle Bank Notes beginning on the interest payment date of July 30, 2020 and on any interest payment date thereafter at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Pinnacle Bank Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption, subject to the prior approval of the FDIC. Pinnacle Bank may redeem the Pinnacle Bank Notes at any time upon the occurrence of certain tax events, capital events or investment company events.\nFrom the date of the issuance through July 29, 2020, the Pinnacle Bank Notes will bear interest at the rate of 4.875% per year and will be payable semi-annually in arrears on January 30 and July 30 of each year, beginning on January 30, 2016. From July 30, 2020, the Pinnacle Bank Notes will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the three-month LIBOR rate plus 3.128%, payable quarterly in arrears on each January 30, April 30, July 30, and October 30, beginning on July 30, 2020, through the maturity date or the early redemption date of the Pinnacle Bank Notes.\nThe sale of the Pinnacle Bank Notes on July 30, 2015 yielded net proceeds of $59.0 million after deducting the placement agents' fees and expenses payable by Pinnacle Bank. Pinnacle Bank used the net proceeds from the July 30, 2015 offering, together with available cash, to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration payable to the shareholders of CapitalMark and Magna in connection with those mergers, to pay the amounts necessary to redeem the preferred shares that each of CapitalMark and Magna had issued to the United States Department of the Treasury in connection with their participation in the Treasury's Small Business Lending Fund and for general corporate purposes. The sale of the Notes on March 10, 2016 yielded net proceeds of approximately $68.4 million after deducting the initial purchasers' discount and expenses payable by Pinnacle Bank. Pinnacle Bank used the net proceeds from the March 1, 2016 offering for general corporate purposes, (including the repayment of short term borrowings of Pinnacle Bank used to pay a portion of the cash portion of the purchase price for the additional equity interests of BHG acquired by Pinnacle Bank on March 1, 2016).\nIn addition, upon consummation of the Avenue Merger, Pinnacle Financial assumed Avenue's obligations under its outstanding $20.0 million subordinated notes issued in December 2014 that mature in December 2024. The Avenue Subordinated Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.75% per annum until January 1, 2020 and may not be redeemed prior to such date. Beginning on January 1, 2020, if not redeemed on such date, the Avenue Subordinated Notes will bear interest at a floating rate equal to the three-month LIBOR determined on the determination date of the applicable interest period plus 4.95%. Interest on the Avenue Subordinated Notes is payable quarterly in arrears on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year, through December 29, 2024 or the earlier date of redemption of all the Avenue Subordinated Notes. The Avenue Subordinated Notes are not subject to redemption at the option of the holders. These notes qualify as Tier 2 capital. These Avenue Subordinated Notes were recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date, and included a discount of $2.7 million, which will be accreted over the life of these notes.\nOn November 16, 2016, Pinnacle Financial completed the issuance, through a private placement, of $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due November 16, 2026 (the \"Pinnacle Financial Notes\") to certain institutional accredited investors. The Pinnacle Financial Notes bear a fixed interest rate of 5.25 percent per annum until November 16, 2021 subject to prior approval of the Federal Reserve, payable semi-annually in arrears. From November 16, 2021, the Pinnacle Financial Notes will bear a floating rate of interest equal to 3-Month LIBOR + 3.884 percent per annum until their maturity on November 16, 2026, or such earlier redemption date, payable quarterly in arrears. The Pinnacle Financial Notes will be redeemable by the Company, in whole or in part, on or after November 16, 2021 or, in whole but not in part, upon the occurrence of certain specified tax events, capital events or investment company events. The Pinnacle Financial Notes are not subject to redemption at the option of the holders. The sale of the Pinnacle Financial Notes yielded net proceeds of approximately $118.3 million, and the Pinnacle Financial Notes qualify initially as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes. The Company used approximately $57 million of the net proceeds to retire all of the outstanding debt under the Company's $75 million revolving credit facility entered into in March 2016. The Company has contributed $50.0 million of the net proceeds to Pinnacle Bank and has returned the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes. The foregoing description does not purport to be a complete description of the Pinnacle Financial Notes.\nUpon consummation of our proposed merger with BNC, we will assume BNC's obligations under its outstanding $60.0 million subordinated notes issued in September 2014 that mature in October 2024. These notes bear interest at a rate of 5.5% per annum until September 30, 2019 and may not be repaid prior to that date. Beginning on October 1, 2019, if not redeemed on that date, these notes will bear interest at a floating rate equal to the three-month LIBOR determined on the determination date of the applicable interest period plus 359 basis points. The $50.5 million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated debentures issued by trust affiliates of BNC in connection with the issuance of trust preferred securities will also be assumed in connection with our merger with BNC.\nOn March 29, 2016, Pinnacle Financial entered into a revolving credit facility with a bank for borrowings of up to $75 million under a loan agreement Pinnacle Financial entered into with the bank (the \"Loan Agreement\"). Borrowings under the revolving credit facility have been used to fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the Avenue merger and to make capital contributions to Pinnacle Bank. Future borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes including to fund capital contributions to Pinnacle Bank. Pinnacle Financial's borrowings under the Loan Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to 2.25% plus the greater of (i) zero percent (0%) and (ii) the one-month LIBOR rate quoted by the lender. The Loan Agreement also requires Pinnacle Financial to pay a quarterly fee equal to 0.35% per annum on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under this agreement.\nCapital Resources. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, our stockholders' equity amounted to $1.497 billion and $1.156 billion, respectively. Approximately $222.2 million of this increase is attributable to shares of Pinnacle Financial Common Stock issued upon our acquisition of Avenue and additional investment in BHG. At December 31, 2016, Pinnacle Bank's common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 9.3%, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 9.3%, the total risk-based capital ratio was 11.2% and the leverage ratio was 9.2%, compared to 9.0%, 9.0%, 10.6% and 8.8% at December 31, 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2016, Pinnacle Financial's common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 7.9%, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 8.6%, the total risk-based capital ratio was 11.9% and the leverage ratio was 8.6%, compared to 8.6%, 9.6%, 11.2% and 9.4% at December 31, 2015, respectively.\nIn July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC approved final rules that substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to Pinnacle Bank and Pinnacle Financial. The final rules which became effective on January 1, 2015, implement the regulatory capital reforms of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision reflected in \"Basel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems\" (Basel III) and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nUnder these rules, the leverage and risk-based capital ratios of bank holding companies may not be lower than the leverage and risk-based capital ratios for insured depository institutions. These rules refined the definition of what constitutes \"capital\" for purposes of calculating those ratios, including the definitions of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. The minimum capital level requirements applicable to bank holding companies and banks subject to the rules are: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions. The rules also establish a \"capital conservation buffer\" of 2.5% (to be phased in over three years) above the new regulatory minimum risk-based capital ratios, and result in the following minimum ratios once the capital conservation buffer is fully phased in: (i) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%. The phase in of the capital conservation buffer began in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increases each year on January 1st until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if capital levels fall below minimum levels plus the buffer amounts. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.\nUnder these rules, Tier 1 capital will generally consist of common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings, limited amounts of minority interest in the form of additional Tier 1 capital instruments, and non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, subject to certain eligibility standards, less goodwill and other specified intangible assets and other regulatory deductions. Cumulative preferred stock and trust preferred securities issued after May 19, 2010, will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital, but such securities issued prior to May 19, 2010, including in the case of bank holding companies with less than $15.0 billion in total assets, trust preferred securities issued prior to that date, will continue to count as Tier 1 capital subject to certain limitations. Upon consummation of our proposed merger with BNC, our total assets will exceed $15 billion and as a result of our total assets exceeding $15 billion as a result of a merger, the subordinated debentures we have issued in connection with our trust preferred securities (along with the subordinated debentures BNC has issued in connection with its trust preferred securities) will cease to qualify as Tier 1 capital. We believe these subordinated debentures will continue to qualify as Tier 2 capital. The definition of Tier 2 capital is generally unchanged for most banking organizations, subject to certain new eligibility criteria.\nCommon equity Tier 1 capital will generally consist of common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings plus limited amounts of minority interest in the form of common stock, less goodwill and other specified intangible assets and other regulatory deductions.\nThe final rules allow banks and their holding companies with less than $250 billion in assets a one-time opportunity to opt-out of a requirement to include unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in their capital calculation. Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank chose to opt-out of this requirement.\nIn January 2017, we completed the public offering of 3.22 million shares of our common stock in a transaction that resulted in net proceeds to us, after deducing underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated other expenses payable by us, of $191.2 million. We have contributed $185.0 million of these net proceeds to our bank subsidiary.\nDividends. Pursuant to Tennessee banking law, Pinnacle Bank may not, without the prior consent of the TDFI, pay any dividends to us in a calendar year in excess of the total of its retained net profits for that year plus the retained net profits for the preceding two years. During the year ended December 31, 2016, Pinnacle Bank paid dividends of $27.7 million to us which was within the limits allowed by the TDFI.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we paid $24.7 million in dividends to common shareholders. On January 17, 2017 our board of directors declared a $0.14 quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders which should approximate $7.0 million in aggregate dividend payments that will be paid on February 24, 2017 to common shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 3, 2017. The amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, is subject to board discretion and will depend on our earnings, capital position, financial condition and other factors, including new regulatory capital requirements, as they become known to us.\nMarket and Liquidity Risk Management\nOur objective is to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. Our Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) is charged with the responsibility of monitoring these policies, which are designed to ensure acceptable composition of asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates. ALCO measures and evaluates the interest rate risk so that we can meet customer demands for various types of loans and deposits. ALCO determines the most appropriate amounts of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items. Measurements which we use to help us manage interest rate sensitivity include an earnings simulation model and an economic value of equity (EVE) model.\nOur interest rate sensitivity modeling incorporates a number of assumptions for both earnings simulation and EVE, including loan and deposit re-pricing characteristics, the rate of loan prepayments, etc. ALCO periodically reviews these assumptions for accuracy based on historical data and future expectations. Our ALCO policy requires that the base scenario assume rates remain flat and is the scenario to which all others are compared in order to measure the change in net interest income and EVE. Policy limits are applied to the results of certain modeling scenarios. While the primary policy scenarios focus is on a twelve month time frame, longer time horizons are also modeled. All policy scenarios assume a static balance sheet, although other scenarios are modeled.\nEarnings simulation model. We believe interest rate risk is best measured by our earnings simulation modeling. Earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next 12 months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations. To limit interest rate risk, we have policy guidelines for our earnings at risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest rates. For changes up or down in rates from management's flat interest rate forecast over the next twelve months, management establishes policy limits in the decline in net interest income for the following scenarios:\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> gradual change of 400 points; instantaneous change of 400 basis points\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> gradual change of 300 points; instantaneous change of 300 basis points\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> gradual change of 200 points; instantaneous change of 200 basis points\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> gradual change of 100 points; instantaneous change of 100 basis points\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2016, our earnings simulation model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for both the gradual and instantaneous interest rate changes.\nEconomic value of equity. Our EVE model measures the extent that estimated economic values of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items will change as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, which establishes a base case EVE. To help limit interest rate risk, we have stated policy guidelines for an instantaneous basis point change in interest rates, in the following scenarios:\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td> +/- 400 basis point change in interest rates\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td> +/- 300 basis point change in interest rates\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td> +/- 200 basis point change in interest rates\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td> +/- 100 basis point change in interest rates\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2016, our EVE model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for the scenarios noted above. However, our policies provide that during certain interest rate cycles, the down basis point rate changes may not be particularly significant given the current slope of the yield curve. Accordingly, we have currently suspended the calculation of the down rate scenarios for EVE measurement for the down 300 and down 400 scenarios.\nAnother commonly analyzed scenario that we also analyze is a most-likely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management. Separate growth assumptions are developed for loans, investments, deposits, etc. Other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks, yield curve steepening or flattening, or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress our balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios.\nEach of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how our net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors) which limit changes in interest rates. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates. ALCO reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies.\nWe may also use derivative financial instruments to improve the balance between interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities and as one tool to manage our interest rate sensitivity while continuing to meet the credit and deposit needs of our customers. We may also enter into interest rate swaps to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs. These swaps qualify as derivatives, even though they are not designated as hedging instruments.\nBased on information gathered from these various modeling scenarios management believes that as of December 31, 2016, our balance sheet would likely be asset sensitive.\nALCO may determine that Pinnacle Financial should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and the firm's conclusions as to anticipated interest rate fluctuations in future periods. At present, ALCO has determined that its \"most likely\" rate scenario considers two increases in short-term interest rates in 2017 while the longer end of the rate curve will increase only slightly. Our \"most likely\" rate forecast has been basically consistent for several quarters and is based primarily on information we acquire from a service which includes a consensus forecast of numerous benchmarks. As a result, and in preparing for the anticipated rise in interest rates, we have implemented the following strategies:\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Reduced our exposure to fixed rate investment securities in relation to total assets from approximately 23% as of December 31, 2010 to a current position of approximately 11.8% of total assets. This reduction should assist the firm in becoming more asset sensitive over time.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Executed a series of cash flow hedges involving approximately $200 million in FHLB borrowings at pre-established fixed rates. Fixed rate liabilities also provide for a more asset sensitive balance sheet.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Participated in interest rate swaps whereby our customers pay a fixed rate which we remit to our counter party while we receive in return a floating rate on these commercial loans. These loans amounted to approximately $667 million at December 31, 2016. Floating rate loans promote an asset sensitive balance sheet.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Reduced the amount of variable rate loans with in-the-money rate floors from $637.8 million as of December 31, 2015 to $469.3 million as of December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Reduced the difference between the weighted average floor rate on floating and variable rate to the weighted average contract rate on these type of loans from 0.81% at December 31, 2015 to 0.69% at December 31, 2016. This reduction results in requiring a lesser increase in shorter-term rates for the floors to be overcome, thus making these loans with rate floors more asset sensitive over time.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe current growth in our balance sheet will also assist us in achievement of increased asset sensitivity over time; however, we may also implement a series of actions designed to accelerate our achievement of neutrality or asset sensitivity as conditions warrant.\nLiquidity Risk Management. The purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure that there are sufficient cash flows to satisfy loan demand, deposit withdrawals, and our other needs. Traditional sources of liquidity for a bank include asset maturities and growth in core deposits. A bank may achieve its desired liquidity objectives from the management of its assets and liabilities and by internally generated funding through its operations. Funds invested in marketable instruments that can be readily sold and the continuous maturing of other earning assets are sources of liquidity from an asset perspective. The liability base provides sources of liquidity through attraction of increased deposits and borrowing funds from various other institutions.\nTo assist in determining the adequacy of our liquidity, we perform a variety of liquidity stress tests including idiosyncratic, systemic and combined scenarios for both moderate and severe events. Liquidity is defined as the ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities. Liquidity management involves maintaining our ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of our customers, both depositors and borrowers. We seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid asset balance to ensure our ability to meet our obligations. The amount of the appropriate minimum liquid asset balance is determined through severe liquidity stress testing as measured by our liquidity coverage ratio calculation. At December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with our liquidity coverage ratio.\nChanges in interest rates also affect our liquidity position. We currently price deposits in response to market rates, and our management intends to continue this policy. If deposits are not priced in response to market rates, a loss of deposits could occur which would negatively affect our liquidity position.\nScheduled loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds, but loan payoffs and deposit flows fluctuate significantly, being influenced by interest rates, general economic conditions and competition. Additionally, debt security investments are subject to prepayment and call provisions that could accelerate their payoff prior to stated maturity. We attempt to price our deposit products to meet our asset/liability objectives consistent with local market conditions. Our ALCO is responsible for monitoring our ongoing liquidity needs. Our regulators also monitor our liquidity and capital resources on a periodic basis.\nAs noted previously, Pinnacle Bank is a member of the FHLB Cincinnati and, pursuant to a borrowing agreement with the FHLB Cincinnati, has pledged certain assets pursuant to a blanket lien. As such, Pinnacle Bank may use the FHLB Cincinnati as a source of liquidity depending on the firm's ALCO strategies. Additionally, we may pledge additional qualifying assets or reduce the amount of pledged assets with the FHLB Cincinnati to increase or decrease our borrowing capacity at the FHLB Cincinnati. At December 31, 2016, we believe we had an estimated $1.432 billion in additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB Cincinnati. However, incremental borrowings are made via a formal request by Pinnacle Bank and the subsequent approval by the FHLB Cincinnati.\nPinnacle Bank also has accommodations with upstream correspondent banks for unsecured short-term advances which aggregate $140.0 million. These accommodations have various covenants related to their term and availability, and in most cases must be repaid within less than a month. There were no outstanding borrowings under these agreements at December 31, 2016, or during the year then ended under such agreements, although we test the availability of these accommodations annually. Pinnacle Bank also has approximately $1.85 billion in available Federal Reserve discount window lines of credit.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $116.7 million in brokered certificates of deposit compared to $7.3 million in brokered certificates of deposit at December 31, 2015. Historically, we have issued brokered certificates through several different brokerage houses based on competitive bid. Through the Avenue acquisition, we acquired non-reciprocal time deposits issued through the CDARS network. We also obtained $50 million in non-reciprocal insured cash sweep deposits under a two-year $200 million agreement. Typically, these funds have been for varying maturities of up to two years and were issued at rates which were competitive to rates we would be required to pay to attract similar deposits within our local markets as well as rates for FHLB advances of similar maturities. Although we consider these deposits to be a ready source of liquidity under current market conditions, we anticipate that these deposits will continue to represent a small percentage of our total funding in 2017 as we seek to continue maintaining a higher level of core deposits.\nIndustry regulators have defined additional liquidity guidelines, through the issuance of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Modified LCR, for banking institutions greater than $250 billion in assets, and $50 billion in assets respectively, in the United States. These regulatory guidelines became effective January 2015 with phase in over subsequent years and will require these large institutions to follow prescriptive guidance in determining an absolute level of a high quality liquid asset (HQLA) buffer that must be maintained on their balance sheets in order to withstand a potential liquidity crisis event. Although Pinnacle Financial follows the principles outlined in the Interagency Policy Statement on Liquidity Risk Management, issued March 2010, to determine its HQLA buffer, Pinnacle Financial is not currently subject to these regulations. However, these formulas could eventually be imposed on smaller banks, such as Pinnacle Bank, and require an increase in the absolute level of liquidity on our balance sheet, which could result in lower net interest margins for us in future periods.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had no significant commitments for capital expenditures. However, we expect to expand our footprint by one location in each of the Knoxville, Chattanooga and Memphis MSAs annually and intend to add to our information technology platform and will likely incur significant capital expenditures.\nOur short-term borrowings (borrowings which mature within the next fiscal year) consist primarily of securities sold under agreements to repurchase (these agreements are typically associated with comprehensive treasury management programs for our clients and provide them with short-term returns on their excess funds) and FHLB Cincinnati advances. Information concerning our short-term borrowings as of and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016 is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>

At December 31, 2016, Pinnacle Financial had junior subordinated debentures of approximately $82.5 million outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the interest rate on the junior subordinated debentures issued in connection with trust preferred securities issued in 2003, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively, ranged from 3.33% to 3.79%, 2.00% to 2.40%, 2.26% to 2.65%, 3.36% to 3.81% , respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2016, Pinnacle Financial incurred interest expense of $365,000, $435,000, $488,000 and $1.1 million, respectively, on its junior subordinated debentures issued in 2003, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. See Note 11 \"Investments in Affiliated Companies and Subordinated Debt\" to Pinnacle Financial's consolidated financial statements for further information.\n(4) Represents interest and principal payments at maturity on Pinnacle Financial's $140.0 million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes (including $20.0 million of subordinated notes assumed in connection with Pinnacle Financial's acquisition of Avenue) and Pinnacle Bank's $130.0 million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes. $120.0 million of Pinnacle Financial's subordinated notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.25% per annum through November 2021, while the $20.0 million of subordinated notes assumed in connection with the Avenue transaction, bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.75% per annun until June 2020. Pinnacle Bank's subordinated notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.875% per annum through July 2020. The amounts representing interest payments on the subordinated notes issued by both Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank for periods after the interest rates are no longer fixed were calculated using the current rates that would be applicable if the floating rate called for by the notes was currently in effect. See Note 11 \"Investments in Affiliated Companies and Subordinated Debt\" to Pinnacle's consolidated financial statements for further information.\nOur management believes that we have adequate liquidity to meet all known contractual obligations and unfunded commitments, including loan commitments and reasonable borrower, depositor, and creditor requirements over the next twelve months. Our operating lease commitments are primarily related to our branch and headquarters facilities. The terms of these leases expire at various points ranging from 2017 through 2039. At December 31, 2016, our total minimum operating lease commitment was $76.4 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements. At December 31, 2016, we had outstanding standby letters of credit of $131.4 million and unfunded loan commitments outstanding of $3.374 billion. Because these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and many will expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment level does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. If needed to fund these outstanding commitments, Pinnacle Bank has the ability to liquidate Federal funds sold or securities available-for-sale, or on a short-term basis to borrow and purchase Federal funds from other financial institutions. The following table presents additional information about our unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2016, which by their terms, have contractual maturity dates subsequent to December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> At December 31, 2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Next 12 months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 13-36 months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 37-60 months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> More than 60 months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Totals\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unfunded commitments:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lines of credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>1,062,312 </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>1,080,003 </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>539,416 </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>692,539 </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>3,374,270 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Letters of credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>117,061 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,956 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>131,418 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Totals\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>1,179,373 </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>1,092,154 </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>539,666 </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>694,495 </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>3,505,688 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe follow the same credit policies and underwriting practices when making these commitments as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. Each customer's creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis and the amount of collateral obtained, if any, is based on management's credit evaluation of the customer. However, should the commitments be drawn upon and should our customers default on their resulting obligation to us, our maximum exposure to credit loss, without consideration of collateral, is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. At December 31, 2016, we had accrued $1.1 million for the inherent risks associated with off balance sheet commitments.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and practices within the banking industry which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02 Leases guidance requiring the recognition in the statement of financial position of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. The guidance requires that a lessee should recognize lease assets and lease liabilities as compared to previous GAAP that did not require lease assets and lease liabilities to be recognized for most leases. The guidance becomes effective for us on January 1, 2019. Pinnacle Financial is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance to Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 Stock Compensation Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Activity intended to simplify and improve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of such awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is expected to impact Pinnacle Financial's consolidated financial statements by requiring that all income tax effects related to settlements of share-based payment awards be reported as increases (or decreases) to income tax expense. Previously, income tax benefits at settlement of an award were reported as an increase (or decrease) to additional paid-in capital. The ASU also requires that all income tax related cash flows resulting from share-based payments be reported as operating activities in the statement of cash flows whereas cash flows were previously reported as a reduction to operating cash flows and an increase to financing cash flows. The guidance became effective for us on January 1, 2017.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (the ASU), which introduces the current expected credit losses methodology. Among other things, the ASU requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets, including loans and available-for-sale debt securities, held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. The new model will require institutions to calculate all probable and estimable losses that are expected to be incurred through the loan's entire life. ASU 2016-13 also requires the allowance for credit losses for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since origination to be determined in a manner similar to that of other financial assets measured at amortized cost; however, the initial allowance will be added to the purchase price rather than recorded as credit loss expense. The disclosure of credit quality indicators related to the amortized cost of financing receivables will be further disaggregated by year of origination (or vintage). Institutions are to apply the changes through a cumulative-effect adjustment to their retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the standard is effective. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Early application will be permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Pinnacle Financial is currently assessing the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-15 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) intended to reduce the diversity in practice around how certain transactions are classified within the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted with retrospective application. Pinnacle Financial is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) developed as a joint project with the International Accounting Standards Board to remove inconsistencies in revenue requirements and provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues. The ASU's core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-14, which deferred the effective date by one year (i.e., interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017). Early adoption is permitted, but not before the original effective date (i.e., interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016). The ASU may be adopted using either a modified retrospective method or a full retrospective method. Pinnacle Financial intends to adopt the ASU during the first quarter of 2018, as required, using a modified retrospective approach. Pinnacle Financial's preliminary analysis suggests that the adoption of this accounting guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements as the majority of its revenue stream is generated from financial instruments which are not within the scope of this ASU. However, Pinnacle Financial is still evaluating the impact for other fee-based income. The FASB continues to release new accounting guidance related to the adoption of this ASU and the results of Pinnacle Financial's materiality analysis may change based on conclusions reached as to the application of this new guidance.\nOther than those pronouncements discussed above and those which have been recently adopted, there were no other recently issued accounting pronouncements that are expected to materially impact Pinnacle Financial.", "item_7_truncated": "The following is our noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 (in thousands):\nA summary of

Our fully diluted net income per common share for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $2.91 compared to fully diluted net income per common share of $2.52 and $2.01 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. At December 31, 2016, loans had increased by $1.907 billion as compared to December 31, 2015.\nOur short-term borrowings (borrowings which mature within the next fiscal year) consist primarily of securities sold under agreements to repurchase (these agreements are typically associated with comprehensive treasury management programs for our clients and provide them with short-term returns on their excess funds) and FHLB Cincinnati advances. Information concerning our short-term borrowings as of and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016 is as follows (in thousands):\nImpairment of Intangible Assets. Long-lived assets, including purchased intangible assets subject to amortization, such as our core deposit intangible asset, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. There are no such assets to be disposed of at December 31, 2016.\nDuring the three years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, Pinnacle Financial recorded income tax expense of $64.2 million, $47.6 million and $35.2 million, respectively. Pinnacle's effective tax rate for the three years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, was 33.5%, 33.3% and 33.3%, respectively, and differs from the combined federal and state income statutory rate primarily due to our investments in bank-qualified municipal securities, our real estate investment trust, participation in Tennessee's Community Investment Tax Credit (CITC) program, bank-owned life insurance and tax savings from our captive insurance subsidiary, offset in part by the limitation on deductibility of meals and entertainment expense and certain merger-related expenses.\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Years ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2016-2015\nPercent\nIncrease\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2015-2014\nPercent\nIncrease\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest income:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service charges on deposit accounts\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,501\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,746\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 13.77\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,707\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 8.88\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,757\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,971\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 7.88\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,383\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 6.27\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Insurance sales commissions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,309\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,824\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 10.05\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,613\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 4.57\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gains on mortgage loans sold, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15,754\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,669\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 105.42\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,630\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 36.22\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment gains on sales and impairments, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (28.44\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> NM\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Trust fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,328\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,461\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 15.88\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,601\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 18.69\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from equity method investment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 31,403\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 20,591\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 52.51\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> NM\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other noninterest income:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interchange and other consumer fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 24,221\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18,214\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 32.98\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,322\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 47.82\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bank-owned life insurance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,547\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,548\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 39.21\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,426\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 5.03\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan swap fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,865\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,578\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 49.92\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> NM\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other noninterest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,923\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,376\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 257.78\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,656\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (16.91\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other noninterest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 36,556\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 24,716\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 47.90\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 16,639\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 48.54\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total noninterest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 121,003\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 86,530\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 39.84\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52,602\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 64.50\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following is a discussion of our financial condition at December 31, 2016 and 2015 and our results of operations for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016.

recently-issued BHG medical practice loan should the previously-acquired loan become at least 90-days past due as to its monthly payments. This substitution is subject to the purchaser having adhered to the standards of its purchase agreement with BHG. Additionally, all substitutions are subject to the approval by BHG's board of directors. As a result, the reacquired loans are deemed purchase credit impaired and recorded on BHG's balance sheet at the net present value of the loan's anticipated cash flows. BHG will then initiate collection efforts and attempt to restore the reacquired loan to performing status. During 2016, BHG's substitution losses related to these activities totaled approximately $23.4 million. As a result, BHG maintained a liability as of December 31, 2016 of $45.9 million that represents an estimate of the future inherent losses for the outstanding core portfolio that may be subject to future substitution.\nOur interest rate sensitivity modeling incorporates a number of assumptions for both earnings simulation and EVE, including loan and deposit re-pricing characteristics, the rate of loan prepayments, etc. ALCO periodically reviews these assumptions for accuracy based on historical data and future expectations. Our ALCO policy requires that the base scenario assume rates remain flat and is the scenario to which all others are compared in order to measure the change in net interest income and EVE. Policy limits are applied to the results of certain modeling scenarios. While the primary policy scenarios focus is on a twelve month time frame, longer time horizons are also modeled. All policy scenarios assume a static balance sheet, although other scenarios are modeled.\nThe following is a summary of changes in the allowance for loan losses for each of the years in the five year period ended December 31, 2016 and the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans as of the end of each period (in thousands):\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Scheduled\nMaturities\n</td> <td> Weighted Average Interest Rates(1)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 392,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 0.79\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14,003\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 1.29\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 0.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2.25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 0.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2.75\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 406,213\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.81\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur funding policies limit the amount of non-core funding we can utilize. Periodically, we may exceed our policy limitations, at which time management will develop plans to bring our core funding ratios back within compliance. As noted in the table above, our core funding as a percentage of total funding decreased from 84.5% at December 31, 2015 to 81.6% at December 31, 2016. Continuing to grow our core deposit base is a key strategic objective of our firm. Our current growth plans contemplate that we may increase our non-core funding amounts from current levels, but we do not currently anticipate that such increases will exceed our internal policies.\n

are designed to promote relationship banking rather than transactional banking. Management examines current and projected cash flows to determine the expected ability of a borrower to repay its obligations as agreed. Commercial and industrial loans are primarily underwritten based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and generally are collateralized by business assets and may have a personal guaranty of business principals. Collateral pledged may include the assets being financed or other assets such as accounts receivable, inventory or equipment. Some short-term loans may be advanced on an unsecured basis.\nOur management believes that we have adequate liquidity to meet all known contractual obligations and unfunded commitments, including loan commitments and reasonable borrower, depositor, and creditor requirements over the next twelve months. Our operating lease commitments are primarily related to our branch and headquarters facilities. The terms of these leases expire at various points ranging from 2017 through 2039. At December 31, 2016, our total minimum operating lease commitment was $76.4 million.\nLoans.

Our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans decreased from 1.00% at December 31, 2015 to 0.70% at December 31, 2016, primarily attributable to improvements in the credit quality of our legacy Pinnacle Bank portfolio and as a result of our acquired loan portfolios being recorded at fair value upon acquisition, thus no allowance for loan losses is assigned to these loans as of the date of acquisition. An allowance for loan losses is recorded for purchased loans that have experienced credit deterioration subsequent to acquisition or increases in balances outstanding.

At December 31, 2016, we had outstanding standby letters of credit of $131.4 million and unfunded loan commitments outstanding of $3.374 billion. Because these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and many will expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment level does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. If needed to fund these outstanding commitments, Pinnacle Bank has the ability to liquidate Federal funds sold or securities available-for-sale, or on a short-term basis to borrow and purchase Federal funds from other financial institutions. The following table presents additional information about our unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2016, which by their terms, have contractual maturity dates subsequent to December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\n (2) Yields based on the carrying value of those tax exempt instruments are shown on a fully tax equivalent basis. \nShould our common stock price decline or other impairment indicators become known, additional impairment testing of goodwill may be required. Should it be determined in a future period that the goodwill has become impaired, then a charge to earnings will be recorded in the period such determination is made. While we believe that the assumptions utilized in our testing were appropriate, they may not reflect actual outcomes that could occur. Specific factors that could negatively impact the assumptions used include the following: a change in the control premium being realized in the market or a meaningful change in the number of mergers and acquisitions occurring; the amount of expense savings that may be realized in an acquisition scenario; significant fluctuations in our asset/liability balances or the composition of our balance sheet; a change in the overall valuation of the stock market, specifically bank stocks; performance of Southeast U.S. Banks; and Pinnacle Financial's performance relative to peers. Changing these assumptions, or any other key assumptions, could have a material impact on the amount of goodwill impairment, if any.\nThe consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and practices within the banking industry which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation.\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\nAccretable Yield </td> <td> </td> <td>\nNonaccretable Yield </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nTotal </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2014 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> - </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> - </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> - </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisitions / Day 1 adjustments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (28,289 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (5,703 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (33,992 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year-to-date accretion/settlement\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,077 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,560 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,637 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> - </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> - </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> - </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(23,212 </td> <td>) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,143 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> (27,355 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisitions / Day 1 adjustments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27,036 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (812 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (27,848 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year-to-date accretion/settlement\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19,884 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,322 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 21,206 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> - </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> - </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> (30,364 </td> <td>) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,633 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> (33,997 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn January 2017, we completed the public offering of 3.22 million shares of our common stock in a transaction that resulted in net proceeds to us, after deducing underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated other expenses payable by us, of $191.2 million.

We undertake this process both to ascertain those loans in the portfolio with elevated credit risk and to assist in our overall evaluation of the risk characteristics of the entire loan portfolio. Our loan review process includes the judgment of management, independent internal loan reviewers, and reviews that may have been conducted by third-party reviewers primarily regulatory examiners. We incorporate relevant loan review results in the allowance.\nCapital Resources. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, our stockholders' equity amounted to $1.497 billion and $1.156 billion, respectively. Approximately $222.2 million of this increase is attributable to shares of Pinnacle Financial Common Stock issued upon our acquisition of Avenue and additional investment in BHG. At December 31, 2016, Pinnacle Bank's common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 9.3%, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 9.3%, the total risk-based capital ratio was 11.2% and the leverage ratio was 9.2%, compared to 9.0%, 9.0%, 10.6% and 8.8% at December 31, 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2016, Pinnacle Financial's common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 7.9%, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 8.6%, the total risk-based capital ratio was 11.9% and the leverage ratio was 8.6%, compared to 8.6%, 9.6%, 11.2% and 9.4% at December 31, 2015, respectively.\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance at beginning of period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 65,432\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,359\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,970\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 69,417\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 73,975\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18,328\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,188\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,635\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,857\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,569\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Charged-off loans:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial real estate -

Construction loans are underwritten utilizing independent appraisals, sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates, financial analysis of the developers and property owners, and expectations of the permanent mortgage market, among other items. Construction loans are generally based upon estimates of costs and appraised value associated with the completed project, which may be inaccurate. Construction loans involve the disbursement of funds during construction with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project. Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be sales of developed property, refinancing in the permanent mortgage market, or an interim loan commitment from us until permanent financing is obtained. These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans because their ultimate repayment depends on the satisfactory completion of construction and is sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, general economic conditions and the availability of long-term financing.\nFrom the date of the issuance through July 29, 2020, the Pinnacle Bank Notes will bear interest at the rate of 4.875% per year and will be payable semi-annually in arrears on January 30 and July 30 of each year, beginning on January 30, 2016. From July 30, 2020, the Pinnacle Bank Notes will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the three-month LIBOR rate plus 3.128%, payable quarterly in arrears on each January 30, April 30, July 30, and October 30, beginning on July 30, 2020, through the maturity date or the early redemption date of the Pinnacle Bank Notes.\nWe have four wholly-owned subsidiaries that are statutory business trusts (the Trusts). We are the sole sponsor of the Trusts and acquired each Trust's common securities. The Trusts were created for the exclusive purpose of issuing 30-year capital trust preferred securities and used the proceeds to acquire junior subordinated debentures (Subordinated Debentures) issued by Pinnacle Financial. The sole assets of the Trusts are the Subordinated Debentures. At December 31, 2016, our approximate $2.5 million investment in the Trusts is included in other investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and our approximate $82.5 million obligation is reflected as subordinated debt.\n \u00b7 Reduced the amount of variable rate loans with in-the-money rate floors from $637.8 million as of December 31, 2015 to $469.3 million as of December 31, 2016 \nOverview\nBased upon our evaluation of the loan portfolio, we believe the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to absorb our estimate of inherent losses existing in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2016. While our policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for loan losses, as well as the resultant provision for loan losses charged to operations, are considered adequate by management, they are necessarily approximate and imprecise. There are factors beyond our control, such as conditions in the local and national economy, local real estate market or a particular industry or borrower which may negatively impact, materially, our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and, thus, the resulting provision for loan losses.\nOn January 22, 2016, we entered into the Merger Agreement to acquire BNC and its wholly owned bank subsidiary Bank of North Carolina. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of BNC's common stock will be converted into 0.5235 shares of Pinnacle Financial Common Stock and all of BNC's outstanding stock options that are not exercised prior to the closing will be cashed out for a payment equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the average closing prices of Pinnacle Financial's Common Stock for the ten (10) trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the closing date of the Merger (adjusted for the Exchange Ratio) over the exercise price of each such option and (ii) the number of shares of BNC common stock subject to each such option. Upon consummation of the Merger, we will assume BNC's obligations under its outstanding $60.0 million subordinated notes issued in September 2014 that mature in October 2024. The $50.5 million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated debentures issued by trust affiliates of BNC in connection with the issuance of trust preferred securities will also be assumed in connection with the Merger.\nWe may also use derivative financial instruments to improve the balance between interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities and as one tool to manage our interest rate sensitivity while continuing to meet the credit and deposit needs of our customers. We may also enter into interest rate swaps to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs. These swaps qualify as derivatives, even though they are not designated as hedging instruments.\n \u00b7 +/- 200 basis point change in interest rates \nAll nonaccruing loans are reassigned to a special assets officer who was not responsible for originating the loan. The special assets officer is responsible for developing an action plan designed to minimize our future losses. Typically, these special assets officers review our loan files, interview prior officers assigned to the relationship, meet with borrowers, inspect collateral, reappraise collateral and/or consult with legal counsel. The special assets officer then recommends an action plan to a committee of senior associates including lenders and workout specialists, which could include foreclosing on collateral, restructuring the loan, issuing demand letters or other actions.\n (2) Classified assets as a percentage of Tier 1 capital plus allowance for loan losses. \n(4) Represents interest and principal payments at maturity on Pinnacle Financial's $140.0 million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes (including $20.0 million of subordinated notes assumed in connection with Pinnacle Financial's acquisition of Avenue) and Pinnacle Bank's $130.0 million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes. $120.0 million of Pinnacle Financial's subordinated notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.25% per annum through November 2021, while the $20.0 million of subordinated notes assumed in connection with the Avenue transaction, bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.75% per annun until June 2020. Pinnacle Bank's subordinated notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.875% per annum through July 2020. The amounts representing interest payments on the subordinated notes issued by both Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank for periods after the interest rates are no longer fixed were calculated using the current rates that would be applicable if the floating rate called for by the notes was currently in effect. See Note 11 \"Investments in Affiliated Companies and Subordinated Debt\" to Pinnacle's consolidated financial statements for further information.\nDue to the weakening credit status of a borrower, we may elect to formally restructure certain loans to facilitate a repayment plan that seeks to minimize the potential losses, if any, that we might incur. These loans are considered troubled debt restructurings. If on nonaccruing status as of the date of restructuring, any restructured loan is included in the nonperforming loan balances as discussed above and is classified as an impaired loan. Loans that have been restructured that are on accrual status as of the restructure date are not included in nonperforming loans; however, such loans are still considered impaired.\nThe accounting principles we follow and our methods of applying these principles conform with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and with general practices within the banking industry. In connection with the application of those principles, we have made judgments and estimates which, in the case of the determination of our allowance for loan losses, the valuation of other real estate owned, the assessment of the valuation of deferred tax assets and the assessment of impairment of intangibles, has been critical to the determination of our financial position and results of operations.\n\n\nNet income for 2016 was $127.2 million compared to $95.5 million in net income in 2015 and $70.5 million in 2014. Fully-diluted net income per common share was $2.91 for 2016 compared to $2.52 for 2015 and $2.01 for 2014.\n \u00b7 Participated in interest rate swaps whereby our customers pay a fixed rate which we remit to our counter party while we receive in return a floating rate on these commercial loans. These loans amounted to approximately $667 million at December 31, 2016. Floating rate loans promote an asset sensitive balance sheet. \n\nThe ASC 450-20 portion of the allowance also includes a small unallocated component. We believe that the unallocated amount is warranted for inherent factors that cannot be practically assigned to individual loan categories, such as the imprecision in the overall loss allocation measurement process, the subjectivity risk of not considering all relevant environmental categories and related measurements and imprecision in our credit risk ratings process. The appropriateness of the unallocated component of the allowance is assessed each quarter end based upon changes in the overall business environment not otherwise captured.\nIndustry regulators have defined additional liquidity guidelines, through the issuance of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Modified LCR, for banking institutions greater than $250 billion in assets, and $50 billion in assets respectively, in the United States. These regulatory guidelines became effective January 2015 with phase in over subsequent years and will require these large institutions to follow prescriptive guidance in determining an absolute level of a high quality liquid asset (HQLA) buffer that must be maintained on their balance sheets in order to withstand a potential liquidity crisis event. Although Pinnacle Financial follows the principles outlined in the Interagency Policy Statement on Liquidity Risk Management, issued March 2010, to determine its HQLA buffer, Pinnacle Financial is not currently subject to these regulations. However, these formulas could eventually be imposed on smaller banks, such as Pinnacle Bank, and require an increase in the absolute level of liquidity on our balance sheet, which could result in lower net interest margins for us in future periods.\nThe above information does not consider the impact of scheduled principal payments.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (the ASU), which introduces the current expected credit losses methodology. Among other things, the ASU requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets, including loans and available-for-sale debt securities, held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. The new model will require institutions to calculate all probable and estimable losses that are expected to be incurred through the loan's entire life. ASU 2016-13 also requires the allowance for credit losses for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since origination to be determined in a manner similar to that of other financial assets measured at amortized cost; however, the initial allowance will be added to the purchase price rather than recorded as credit loss expense. The disclosure of credit quality indicators related to the amortized cost of financing receivables will be further disaggregated by year of origination (or vintage). Institutions are to apply the changes through a cumulative-effect adjustment to their retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the standard is effective. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Early application will be permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Pinnacle Financial is currently assessing the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\nProvision expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 has increased as compared to 2015, primarily due to increased charge-offs in our consumer portfolio, primarily related to automobile loans, although the overall amount of the allowance declined. Provision expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased as compared to 2014, primarily due to increased charge-offs in our consumer portfolio, although the overall amount of the allowance declined.\nThe final rules allow banks and their holding companies with less than $250 billion in assets a one-time opportunity to opt-out of a requirement to include unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in their capital calculation. Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank chose to opt-out of this requirement.\nThe following is a summary of our results of operations for 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands except per share data):\n\nThe increase in service charges on deposit accounts in 2016 compared to 2015 and 2014 is primarily related to increased analysis fees on our commercial client accounts and for both periods presented, an increase in our deposit base when compared the prior period, respectively.\nOur allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased from 1.00% at December 31, 2015 to 0.70% at December 31, 2016, largely because the loans we acquired in conjunction with the Avenue merger were reflected at fair value at the acquisition date. Management believes the decrease in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was supported by the credit quality in our loan portfolio despite increasing charge-offs related to automobile financing, which represents a small portion of the total portfolio. The overall methodology used to estimate the allowance for loan losses is consistent with the prior year. For purchased loans (including those acquired in connection with our mergers), the allowance for loan losses subsequent to the acquisition date is consistent with that utilized for legacy Pinnacle Financial loans. Our accounting policy is to compare the computed allowance for loan losses on purchased loans to the remaining fair value adjustment at the individual loan level. If the computed allowance is greater than the remaining fair value adjustment, the excess is added to the allowance for loan losses by a provision for loan losses. Additional provisioning for purchased portfolios results from credit deterioration on the individual loan or from increased borrowings on loans and lines that existed as of the acquisition date.\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment annually and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Our annual assessment date is September 30. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset's fair value.\n \u00b7 gradual change of 400 points; instantaneous change of 400 basis points \n\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our net interest spread was 3.46%, while the net interest margin was 3.70% compared to a net interest spread of 3.55% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 3.65% for the year ended December 31, 2014, and a net interest margin of 3.72% and 3.75%, respectively. Our loan yields grew only slightly between 2016 and 2015 as the competition for quality loans is intense and the market dictates the rate necessary in order to grow volumes, but were further positively impacted by the accretion of the fair value marks recorded in conjunction with our acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2016, total funding rates were more than those rates for the year ended December 31, 2015 by 15 basis points and were more than those rates for the year ended December 31, 2014 by 3 basis points. The net increase was impacted by our acquisitions as their deposit rates were higher, interest rate increases, increased FHLB borrowings, and our subordinated debt issuances during 2016. The subordinated debt instruments qualify as Tier 2 capital.\nRate and Volume Analysis. Net interest income increased by $88.4 million between the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 and by $43.6 million between the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015. The following is an analysis of the changes in our net interest income comparing the changes attributable to rates and those attributable to volumes (in thousands):\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, merger-related charges of $11.7 million and $4.8 million were incurred associated with our acquisitions of Avenue, CapitalMark and Magna. Merger expense during 2016 includes legal costs incurred associated with the Avenue merger to defend ourselves and Avenue's directors in a shareholder suit as well as investigation and other legal costs associated with a former director's alleged improper trading in Avenue common stock. Merger expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, also includes the costs of technical conversions which were completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 for Magna, in the first quarter of 2016 for CapitalMark and in the third quarter of 2016 for Avenue. Associate related expenses such as retention bonuses are also included in these expenses. We do not expect any future merger-related charges due to the acquisitions of CapitalMark and Magna, and we do not expect future merger-related charges due to the acquisition of Avenue, if any, to be significant. However, merger-related charges are expected to be incurred related to our proposed acquisition of BNC during 2017.\nAt December 31, 2016, our EVE model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for the scenarios noted above. However, our policies provide that during certain interest rate cycles, the down basis point rate changes may not be particularly significant given the current slope of the yield curve. Accordingly, we have currently suspended the calculation of the down rate scenarios for EVE measurement for the down 300 and down 400 scenarios.\nLoan Origination Risk Management. We maintain lending policies and procedures designed to maximize lending opportunities within an acceptable level of risk. Management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis. A reporting system supplements the review process by providing management with frequent reports related to loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies and non-performing loans. Diversification in the loan portfolio is measured and monitored as a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions.\nThe sale of the Pinnacle Bank Notes on July 30, 2015 yielded net proceeds of $59.0 million after deducting the placement agents' fees and expenses payable by Pinnacle Bank. Pinnacle Bank used the net proceeds from the July 30, 2015 offering, together with available cash, to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration payable to the shareholders of CapitalMark and Magna in connection with those mergers, to pay the amounts necessary to redeem the preferred shares that each of CapitalMark and Magna had issued to the United States Department of the Treasury in connection with their participation in the Treasury's Small Business Lending Fund and for general corporate purposes. The sale of the Notes on March 10, 2016 yielded net proceeds of approximately $68.4 million after deducting the initial purchasers' discount and expenses payable by Pinnacle Bank. Pinnacle Bank used the net proceeds from the March 1, 2016 offering for general corporate purposes, (including the repayment of short term borrowings of Pinnacle Bank used to pay a portion of the cash portion of the purchase price for the additional equity interests of BHG acquired by Pinnacle Bank on March 1, 2016).\nPotential Problem Loans. Potential problem loans amounted to approximately $114.6 million, or 1.4% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2016, compared to $105.0 million, or 1.6% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2015. Potential problem loans, which are not included in nonperforming loans, represent those loans with a well-defined weakness and where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have doubts about the borrower's ability to comply with present repayment terms. This definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by Pinnacle Bank's primary regulators, for loans classified as substandard or worse, but not considered nonperforming loans. Approximately $4.5 million of potential problem loans were past due at least 30 but less than 90 days as of December 31, 2016.\n\nWe continue to deploy various asset liability management strategies to manage our risk to interest rate fluctuations. We believe margin expansion over both the short and the long term will be challenging due to continued pressure on earning asset yields during this extended period of a low interest rates. Loan pricing for creditworthy borrowers is very competitive in our markets and has limited our ability to increase pricing on new and renewed loans over the last couple of years. We anticipate that this challenging competitive environment will continue in 2017. However, we believe our net interest income should increase in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in average earning asset volumes, primarily loans, as well as the incremental amounts attributable for Avenue. We anticipate funding these increased earning assets by continuing to grow our core deposits, with wholesale and other forms of noncore funding limited to that required to fund the shortfall, if any.\nAt December 31, 2016, we owned $6.1 million in other real estate which we had acquired, usually through foreclosure, from borrowers compared to $5.1 million at December 31, 2015; the majority of this real estate is located within our principal markets. We categorize other real estate owned into three types: developed lots, undeveloped land, and other. Included in the \"other\" category are primarily condominiums, office buildings and residential homes that are not new construction. The following table shows the amounts of our other real estate owned in such categories (in thousands):\nFinancial Condition. Our loan balances increased by $1.907 billion during 2016 compared to an increase of $1.953 billion in 2015. The increase in our outstanding loan balances is the result of our acquisitions, as well as the continued economic growth in our other Tennessee markets, increases in the number of relationship advisors and increased focus on attracting new customers to our company.\nUnder these rules, the leverage and risk-based capital ratios of bank holding companies may not be lower than the leverage and risk-based capital ratios for insured depository institutions. These rules refined the definition of what constitutes \"capital\" for purposes of calculating those ratios, including the definitions of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. The minimum capital level requirements applicable to bank holding companies and banks subject to the rules are: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions. The rules also establish a \"capital conservation buffer\" of 2.5% (to be phased in over three years) above the new regulatory minimum risk-based capital ratios, and result in the following minimum ratios once the capital conservation buffer is fully phased in: (i) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%. The phase in of the capital conservation buffer began in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increases each year on January 1st until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if capital levels fall below minimum levels plus the buffer amounts. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.\nWe follow the same credit policies and underwriting practices when making these commitments as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. Each customer's creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis and the amount of collateral obtained, if any, is based on management's credit evaluation of the customer. However, should the commitments be drawn upon and should our customers default on their resulting obligation to us, our maximum exposure to credit loss, without consideration of collateral, is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. At December 31, 2016, we had accrued $1.1 million for the inherent risks associated with off balance sheet commitments.\n (1) Some FHLB advances include variable interest rates and could increase in the future. The table reflects rates in effect as of December 31, 2016. \nWe discontinue the accrual of interest income when (1) there is a significant deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower and full repayment of principal and interest is not expected or (2) the principal or interest is more than 90 days past due, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, we recognized $159,000, $308,000 and $256,000 of interest income from nonperforming loans, reflecting cash payments received from the borrower and our belief, at the time of payment, that the underlying collateral supported the carrying amount of the loans.\n \u00b7 +/- 100 basis point change in interest rates \n\nIncome from equity-method investment is comprised of income from our 49% equity-method investment in BHG. We acquired a 30% investment during the first quarter of 2015 and subsequently increased our investment by 19% in the first quarter of 2016. Income from this equity-method investment was $31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Income from equity-method investment is recorded net of associated expenses, including amortization expense associated with customer lists and other intangible assets of $3.4 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2016, there were $16.8 million of these intangible assets which will be amortized in lesser amounts over the next 19 years. Also included in income from equity-method investment, is accretion income associated with the fair valuation of certain of BHG's liabilities of $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, while no accretion income was recorded in 2015. At December 31, 2016, there were $18.1 million of these liabilities which will be accreted in lesser amounts over the next 10 years.\n\nWe also originate consumer loans, including consumer real-estate loans, where we typically use a computer-based credit scoring analysis to supplement the underwriting process. To monitor and manage consumer loan risk, policies and procedures are developed and modified, as needed, jointly by line and staff personnel. This activity, coupled with relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers, seeks to minimize risk. Additionally, trend and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis. Underwriting standards for home equity loans are heavily influenced by statutory requirements.\nWe also maintain an independent loan review department that reviews and validates the credit risk program on a periodic basis. Results of these reviews are presented to management and the audit committee. The loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel, as well as our policies and procedures.\nThe estimated loan loss allocation for all loan segments also considers management's estimate of probable losses for a number of qualitative factors that have not been considered in the loan migration analysis. The qualitative categories and the measurements used to quantify the risks within each of these categories are subjectively selected by management, but measured by objective measurements period over period. The data for each measurement may be obtained from internal or external sources. The current period measurements are evaluated and assigned a factor commensurate with the current level of risk relative to past measurements over time. The resulting factor is applied to the non-impaired loan portfolio. This amount represents estimated probable inherent credit losses which exist, but have not yet been identified either in our risk rating or impairment process, as of the balance sheet date, and is based upon quarterly trend assessments in portfolio concentrations, policy exceptions, economic conditions, staff performance, independent loan review results, collateral considerations, credit quality, competition and regulatory requirements, enterprise wide risk assessments, and peer group credit quality. The qualitative allowance allocation, as determined by the processes noted above, is increased or decreased for each loan segment based on the assessment of these various qualitative factors.\n \u00b7 BHG will maintain loans on its balance sheet for a period of time prior to sale or transfer to a purchaser. BHG also has an investment portfolio on which it earns interest and dividend income. Net interest income and fees associated with this activity amounted to $20.3 million and $18.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \nALCO may determine that Pinnacle Financial should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and the firm's conclusions as to anticipated interest rate fluctuations in future periods. At present, ALCO has determined that its \"most likely\" rate scenario considers two increases in short-term interest rates in 2017 while the longer end of the rate curve will increase only slightly. Our \"most likely\" rate forecast has been basically consistent for several quarters and is based primarily on information we acquire from a service which includes a consensus forecast of numerous benchmarks. As a result, and in preparing for the anticipated rise in interest rates, we have implemented the following strategies:\nEquipment and occupancy expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 28.7% greater than in 2015 which was 13.1% greater than in 2014, primarily due to the locations acquired upon our mergers with Avenue, CapitalMark and Magna. Additionally, one branch was added in the Knoxville MSA in each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016. We intend to expand our footprint by one location in each of the Knoxville, Chattanooga, and Memphis MSAs annually. In future periods, these expansions may lead to higher equipment and occupancy expenses as well as related increases in salaries benefits expense.\nPursuant to the guidance set forth in ASU No. 2011-02, A Creditor's Determination of Whether a Restructuring is a Troubled Debt Restructuring, the above impairment methodology is also applied to those loans identified as troubled debt restructurings.\nOur efficiency ratio (the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income) was 53.0%, 52.9% and 55.5% for the three years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The efficiency ratio measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance to Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 Stock Compensation Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Activity intended to simplify and improve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of such awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is expected to impact Pinnacle Financial's consolidated financial statements by requiring that all income tax effects related to settlements of share-based payment awards be reported as increases (or decreases) to income tax expense. Previously, income tax benefits at settlement of an award were reported as an increase (or decrease) to additional paid-in capital. The ASU also requires that all income tax related cash flows resulting from share-based payments be reported as operating activities in the statement of cash flows whereas cash flows were previously reported as a reduction to operating cash flows and an increase to financing cash flows. The guidance became effective for us on January 1, 2017.\nLending Concentrations. We periodically analyze our commercial loan portfolio to determine if a concentration of credit risk exists to any one or more industries. We use broadly accepted industry classification systems in order to classify borrowers into various industry classifications. We have a credit exposure (loans outstanding plus unfunded commitments) exceeding 25% of Pinnacle Bank's total risk-based capital to borrowers in the following industries at December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nThe following table shows the carrying value of investment securities according to contractual maturity classifications of (1) one year or less, (2) after one year through five years, (3) after five years through ten years, and (4) after ten years. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities of mortgage-backed securities because the mortgages underlying the securities may be called or prepaid with or without penalty. Therefore, these securities are not included in the maturity categories but are listed below these categories as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nNoninterest income for 2016 compared to 2015 increased by $34.5 million, or 39.8%. The increase was primarily due to income from our investment in BHG, which was $31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Income from equity method investment represents our 30% equity method investment in BHG for the year ended December 31, 2015 and beginning on March 1, 2016 also includes our additional 19% investment in BHG. The additional growth was attributable to our overall increase in our geographic footprint, increased transaction accounts, increased production in our fee-based products such as investments, insurance and trust and net gains on the sale of mortgage loans. The year-over-year growth in net gains on the sale of mortgage loans was attributed to both an increase in the number of mortgage originators as well as the positive impact of the low interest rate environment on mortgage production. Noninterest income for 2015 compared to 2014 increased by $33.9 million, or 64.5%, which was primarily attributable to our 30% equity method investment in BHG. The remaining increase was attributable to increased interchange revenues as well as increased production in our fee-based products such as investments, insurance and trust.\n \u00b7 Reduced the difference between the weighted average floor rate on floating and variable rate to the weighted average contract rate on these type of loans from 0.81% at December 31, 2015 to 0.69% at December 31, 2016. This reduction results in requiring a lesser increase in shorter-term rates for the floors to be overcome, thus making these loans with rate floors more asset sensitive over time. \nIn addition, upon consummation of the Avenue Merger, Pinnacle Financial assumed Avenue's obligations under its outstanding $20.0 million subordinated notes issued in December 2014 that mature in December 2024. The Avenue Subordinated Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.75% per annum until January 1, 2020 and may not be redeemed prior to such date. Beginning on January 1, 2020, if not redeemed on such date, the Avenue Subordinated Notes will bear interest at a floating rate equal to the three-month LIBOR determined on the determination date of the applicable interest period plus 4.95%. Interest on the Avenue Subordinated Notes is payable quarterly in arrears on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year, through December 29, 2024 or the earlier date of redemption of all the Avenue Subordinated Notes. The Avenue Subordinated Notes are not subject to redemption at the option of the holders. These notes qualify as Tier 2 capital. These Avenue Subordinated Notes were recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date, and included a discount of $2.7 million, which will be accreted over the life of these notes.\n\n (1) Approximately $16.7 million and $19.0 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of nonperforming loans included above are currently paying pursuant to their contractual terms. \n\n \u00b7 Executed a series of cash flow hedges involving approximately $200 million in FHLB borrowings at pre-established fixed rates. Fixed rate liabilities also provide for a more asset sensitive balance sheet. \nTo assist in determining the adequacy of our liquidity, we perform a variety of liquidity stress tests including idiosyncratic, systemic and combined scenarios for both moderate and severe events. Liquidity is defined as the ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities. Liquidity management involves maintaining our ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of our customers, both depositors and borrowers. We seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid asset balance to ensure our ability to meet our obligations. The amount of the appropriate minimum liquid asset balance is determined through severe liquidity stress testing as measured by our liquidity coverage ratio calculation. At December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with our liquidity coverage ratio.\nDividends. Pursuant to Tennessee banking law, Pinnacle Bank may not, without the prior consent of the TDFI, pay any dividends to us in a calendar year in excess of the total of its retained net profits for that year plus the retained net profits for the preceding two years. During the year ended December 31, 2016, Pinnacle Bank paid dividends of $27.7 million to us which was within the limits allowed by the TDFI.\n\nIn July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC approved final rules that substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to Pinnacle Bank and Pinnacle Financial. The final rules which became effective on January 1, 2015, implement the regulatory capital reforms of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision reflected in \"Basel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems\" (Basel III) and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nPerforming Loans in Past Due Status. The following table is a summary of our accruing loans that were past due between 30 and 90 days and greater than 90 days as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands):\nSubordinated debt and other borrowings. Pinnacle Bank receives advances from the FHLB Cincinnati, pursuant to the terms of various borrowing agreements, which assist it in the funding of its home mortgage and commercial real estate loan portfolios. Under the borrowing agreements with the FHLB Cincinnati, Pinnacle Bank has pledged certain qualifying residential mortgage loans and, pursuant to a blanket lien, all qualifying commercial mortgage loans as collateral. At December 31, 2016, Pinnacle Bank had received advances from the FHLB totaling $406.3 million. Additionally, Pinnacle Financial recognized a discount on FHLB Cincinnati advances in conjunction with previous acquisitions. The remaining discount was $92,000 at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, the scheduled maturities of these advances and interest rates are as follows (in thousands):\nThe Subordinated Debentures are unsecured, bear interest at a rate equal to the rates paid by the Trusts on the Trust Preferred Securities and mature on the same dates as those noted above for the Trust Preferred Securities. Interest is payable quarterly. We may defer the payment of interest at any time for a period not exceeding 20 consecutive quarters provided that the deferral period does not extend past the stated maturity. During any such deferral period, distributions on the Trust Preferred Securities will also be deferred and our ability to pay dividends on our common shares will be restricted.\nNoninterest expense related to the amortization of intangibles was $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $2.0 million and $948,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The following table outlines our amortizing intangible assets and the related amortizable life of our acquired intangible assets:\nNon-Performing Assets and Troubled Debt Restructurings. At December 31, 2016, we had $33.7 million in nonperforming assets compared to $36.3 million at December 31, 2015. Included in nonperforming assets were $27.6 million in nonperforming loans and $6.1 million in other real estate owned at December 31, 2016 and $29.3 million in nonperforming loans and $7.0 million in other real estate owned at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, there were $15.0 million and $8.1 million, respectively, of troubled debt restructurings that were performing as of the restructured date and remain in a performing status.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had no significant commitments for capital expenditures. However, we expect to expand our footprint by one location in each of the Knoxville, Chattanooga and Memphis MSAs annually and intend to add to our information technology platform and will likely incur significant capital expenditures.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIncome from our wealth management groups (investments, insurance and trust) is also included in noninterest income. For the year ended December 31, 2016, commissions and fees from investment services at our financial advisory unit, Pinnacle Asset Management, a division of Pinnacle Bank were $10.8 million, compared to $10.0 million at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, Pinnacle Asset Management was receiving commissions and fees in connection with approximately $2.2 billion in brokerage assets held with Raymond James Financial Services, Inc. compared to $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2015 and 2014. Insurance commissions were approximately $5.3 million during 2016 and $4.8 million during 2015 and $4.6 million during 2014. Additionally, at December 31, 2016, our trust department was receiving fees on approximately $1.0 billion and $755 million of managed and custodied assets, respectively, compared to approximately $916 million and $675 million at December 31, 2015 and $765 million and $861 million at December 31, 2014.\n\nCapital and Liquidity. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, our capital ratios, including our bank's capital ratios, exceeded regulatory minimum capital requirements. From time to time we may be required to support the capital needs of our bank subsidiary. At December 31, 2016, we had approximately $37.0 million of cash at the holding company which could be used to support our bank. We believe we have various capital raising techniques available to us to provide for the capital needs of our bank, if necessary. In January 2017, we completed a public offering of 3.22 million shares of our common stock in a transaction that resulted in net proceeds to us, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated other expenses payable by us, of approximately $191.2 million. We have contributed $185.0 million of these net proceeds to our bank subsidiary.\nWe acquired CapitalMark Bank and Trust (CapitalMark) on July 31, 2015 and Magna Bank (Magna) on September 1, 2015. We acquired Avenue Financial Holdings, Inc. (Avenue) and its bank subsidiary Avenue Bank on July 1, 2016. At the acquisition date, CapitalMark's net assets were fair valued at $73.2 million, including loans of $857.5 million and deposits valued at $953.2 million. At the acquisition date, Magna's net assets were fair valued at $49.1 million, including loans of $440.7 million and deposits valued at $452.7 million. At the acquisition date, Avenue's net assets were preliminarily fair valued at $81.7 million, including loans of $952.5 million and deposits valued at $966.7 million. These acquisitions further expanded our footprint into our core Tennessee markets.\nOur consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016 reflects an increase of $1.907 billion in outstanding loans to $8.450 billion and an increase of $1.788 billion in total deposits to $8.759 billion from December 31, 2015. Total assets were $11.195 billion at December 31, 2016 as compared to $8.715 billion at December 31, 2015. We acquired loans of $952.5 million and deposits totaling $966.7 million upon our acquisition of Avenue in 2016. Collectively, we acquired $1.298 billion in loans and $1.406 billion in deposits upon our acquisitions of CapitalMark and Magna in 2015.\nThe allowance for loan losses for purchased loans is calculated similar to that utilized for our legacy loans. Our accounting policy is to compare the computed allowance for loan losses for purchased loans to any remaining fair value adjustment on a loan-by-loan basis. If the computed allowance is greater than the remaining fair value adjustment, the excess is added to the allowance for loan losses by a provision for loan losses.\n(*)Daily floating rate loans are tied to Pinnacle Bank's prime lending rate or a national interest rate index with the underlying loan rates changing in relation to changes in these indexes. Included in variable rate loans are $469 million of loans which are currently priced at their contractual floors with a weighted average rate of 4.55%. The weighted average contractual rate on these loans is 3.86% As a result, interest income on these loans will not change until the contractual rate on the underlying loan exceeds the interest rate floor.\nImpacting the provision for loan losses in any accounting period are several factors including the change in outstanding loan balances, the level of charge-offs and recoveries, the changes in the amount of impaired loans, changes in the risk ratings assigned to our loans, results of regulatory examinations, credit quality comparison to peer banks, the industry at large, and, ultimately, the results of our quarterly assessment of the inherent risks of our loan portfolio including past loan loss experience.\nEach of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how our net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors) which limit changes in interest rates. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates. ALCO reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies.\nIncome Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2016, Pinnacle Financial recorded income tax expense of $64.2 million. Our effective income tax rate was 33.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 33.3% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, which is principally impacted by our investments in bank-qualified municipal securities, our real estate investment trust, participation in the Tennessee CITC program, and bank-owned life insurance, offset in part by the limitation on deductibility of meals and entertainment expense and certain merger-related expenses. In the event the federal corporate tax rate decreases, as is currently being discussed in Congress, we would be required to write down the value of our deferred tax asset, which would negatively impact income tax expense. Our net deferred tax assets were $49.8 million at December 31, 2016.\nOur objective is to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. Our Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) is charged with the responsibility of monitoring these policies, which are designed to ensure acceptable composition of asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management.\nBased on information gathered from these various modeling scenarios management believes that as of December 31, 2016, our balance sheet would likely be asset sensitive.\nWe have experienced growth in all segments of our portfolio. At December 31, 2016, our loan portfolio composition remained relatively consistent with the composition at December 31, 2015. Despite the acquisitions that were completed during 2015 and 2016, we believe that loan growth in 2017 in the commercial real estate - mortgage segment will outpace loan payoffs in that segment of the portfolio resulting in an increase in the percentage of commercial real estate - mortgage loans as a percentage of total loans. The commercial real estate - mortgage category includes owner-occupied commercial real estate loans. At December 31, 2016, approximately 42.4% of the outstanding principal balance of our commercial real estate - mortgage loans was secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate properties. Owner-occupied commercial real estate is similar in many ways to our commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses on the basis of the cash flows of the business rather than on the valuation of the real estate. Growth in the construction and development loan segment reflects the development of the local economies in which we operate and is diversified between commercial, residential and land.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we paid $24.7 million in dividends to common shareholders. On January 17, 2017 our board of directors declared a $0.14 quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders which should approximate $7.0 million in aggregate dividend payments that will be paid on February 24, 2017 to common shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 3, 2017. The amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, is subject to board discretion and will depend on our earnings, capital position, financial condition and other factors, including new regulatory capital requirements, as they become known to us.\nAs our ownership interest in BHG is 49%, we do not consolidate BHG's results of operations or financial position into our financial statements but record the net result of BHG's activities at our percentage ownership in income from equity method investment in noninterest income. For the year ended December 31, 2016, BHG reported $136.7 million in gross revenues compared to $144.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The following discussion considers BHG's results of operations for 2016 and 2015 prior to consideration of our ownership interest.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates. ALCO measures and evaluates the interest rate risk so that we can meet customer demands for various types of loans and deposits. ALCO determines the most appropriate amounts of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items. Measurements which we use to help us manage interest rate sensitivity include an earnings simulation model and an economic value of equity (EVE) model.\nUpon consummation of our proposed merger with BNC, we will assume BNC's obligations under its outstanding $60.0 million subordinated notes issued in September 2014 that mature in October 2024. These notes bear interest at a rate of 5.5% per annum until September 30, 2019 and may not be repaid prior to that date. Beginning on October 1, 2019, if not redeemed on that date, these notes will bear interest at a floating rate equal to the three-month LIBOR determined on the determination date of the applicable interest period plus 359 basis points. The $50.5 million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated debentures issued by trust affiliates of BNC in connection with the issuance of trust preferred securities will also be assumed in connection with our merger with BNC.\nAs part of our asset liability policy, to manage our interest rate risk, we utilize various strategies in order to achieve our goals. During 2015, Pinnacle Bank prepaid one of its previously restructured FHLB advances resulting in $481,000 in debt extinguishment expense. No prepayments occurred in 2016.\nThe second component of the allowance for loan losses is determined pursuant to ASC 310-10-35. Loans are impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Collection of all amounts due according to the contractual terms means collecting all interest and principal payments of a loan as scheduled in the loan agreement. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change. Loan losses are charged off when management believes that the full collectability of the loan is unlikely. A loan may be partially charged-off after a \"confirming event\" has occurred which serves to validate that full repayment pursuant to the terms of the loan is unlikely.\nThe ASC 450-20 component of the allowance for loan losses begins with a migration analysis based on our internal system of risk rating, if applicable, and historical loss data in our portfolio, by loan type. The migration analysis accumulates losses realized over a rolling four-quarter cycle and is utilized to determine an annual loss rate for each category for each quarter-end in our look-back period. The look-back period in our migration analysis includes 24 quarters as we believe this period is representative of an economic cycle. The loss rates for each category are then averaged and applied to the end of period loan portfolio balances to determine estimated losses. The estimated losses by category are then adjusted by a specifically-determined loss emergence period for each type of loan in our portfolio. A loss emergence period represents the length of time from the initial event which triggered the loss to the recognition of the loss by Pinnacle Bank. Combined, the loss rates and loss emergence period provide a quantitative estimate of credit losses inherent in our end of period loan portfolio based on our actual loss experience.\nDeposits and Other Borrowings. We had approximately $6.971 billion of deposits at December 31, 2015 compared to $8.759 billion at December 31, 2016. Our deposits consist of noninterest and interest-bearing demand accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and time deposits. Additionally, we entered into agreements with certain customers to sell certain of our securities under agreements to repurchase the security the following day. These agreements (which are typically associated with comprehensive treasury management programs for our commercial clients and provide the client with short-term returns for their excess funds) amounted to $85.7 million at December 31, 2016 and $79.1 million at December 31, 2015. Additionally, at December 31, 2016, we had borrowed $406.3 million in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (FHLB Cincinnati) compared to $300.3 million at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, we had an estimated $1.432 billion in additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB Cincinnati; however, incremental borrowings are made via a formal request by us and the subsequent approval by the FHLB Cincinnati.\nThe decrease in the overall allowance for loan losses is due to the improvement in the larger segments of our loan portfolio, which is largely influenced by the overall improvement in the economy in our current geographic markets. Net charge-offs in the consumer portfolio have remained elevated in 2016, primarily due to the non-prime automobile portfolio. The balance of the non-prime automobile portfolio continues to decrease period over period. The allocation by category is determined based on the assigned risk rating, if applicable, and qualitative factors applicable to each category of loans. For impaired loans, those loans are reviewed for a specific allowance allocation. Specific valuation allowances related to impaired loans were approximately $1.1 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $5.2 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily related to the resolution of impaired loans with a specific allowance in 2016. The unallocated category is intended to allow for losses that are inherent in our portfolio that we have not yet identified or attributable to a specific risk factor and for modeling imprecision. Additional information on the allocation of the allowance between performing and impaired loans is provided in Note 6 to the \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\"\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for loan losses that, in management's evaluation, we believe to be adequate to provide coverage for the inherent losses on outstanding loans. The provision for loan losses amounted to approximately $18.3 million, $9.2 million, and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nGains on mortgage loans sold, net, consists of fees from the origination and sale of residential mortgage loans. These mortgage fees are for loans originated in our current markets that are subsequently sold to third-party investors. Substantially all of these loan sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer. Generally, mortgage origination fees increase in lower interest rate environments and more robust housing markets and decrease in rising interest rate environments and more challenging housing markets. Mortgage origination fees will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as the rate environment changes. Gains on mortgage loans sold, net, were $15.8 million, $7.7 million and $5.6 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The increase between each of the periods is attributable to the strong economy in our markets, the continued low interest rate environment and additional personnel in our production unit in 2016 when compared to 2015 and 2014. We hedge a portion of our mortgage pipeline as part of a mandatory delivery program. There is a strong positive correlation between the size of the mortgage pipeline and the value of this hedge. The hedge is not designated as a hedge for GAAP purposes and, as such, changes in its fair value are recorded directly thru the income statement. Therefore, the size of the outstanding mortgage pipeline at any reporting period will directly impact the amount of revenue recorded for mortgage loans held for sale in any one period. During 2016, we realized an increase in the volume of loans included in the mortgage pipeline, and therefore recognized a gain on the change in the fair market value of the hedge. Decreases in the volume of loans included in the mortgage pipeline are likely to negatively impact the gains we recognize as a result of this program.\n\n\nWhile our policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for loan losses, as well as the resultant provision for loan losses charged to operations, are considered adequate by management and are reviewed from time to time by our regulators, they are necessarily approximate and inherently imprecise. There are factors beyond our control, such as conditions in the local, national, and international economy, a local real estate market or particular industry conditions which may negatively impact materially our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and thus the resulting provision for loan losses.\nThe Trust Preferred Securities may be redeemed prior to maturity at our option. The Trust Preferred Securities may also be redeemed at any time in whole (but not in part) in the event of unfavorable changes in laws or regulations that result in (1) the Trust becoming subject to federal income tax on income received on the Subordinated Debentures, (2) interest payable by the parent company on the Subordinated Debentures becoming non-deductible for federal tax purposes, (3) the requirement for the Trust to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or (4) loss of the ability to treat the Trust Preferred Securities as \"Tier I capital\" under the Federal Reserve capital adequacy guidelines.\nWe believe that cash and equity incentives are a valuable tool in motivating an employee base that is focused on providing our clients effective financial advice and increasing shareholder value. As a result, and unlike many other financial institutions, all of our non-commissioned associates participate in our annual cash incentive plan, and all of our associates participate in our equity compensation plans. Under the annual cash incentive plan, the targeted level of incentive payments requires achievement of a certain soundness threshold and a targeted level of revenues and earnings (subject to certain adjustments). To the extent that the soundness threshold is met and revenues and earnings are above or below the targeted amount, the aggregate incentive payments are increased or decreased. Historically, we have paid between 0% and 125% of our targeted incentives. In 2016, our cash incentives represented 90% of targeted incentive compensation compared to 100% in 2015 and 123% in 2014.\n \u00b7 Additionally, BHG will also refer loans to other financial institutions and, based an agreement with the institution, earn a fee for doing so. Typically, these are loans that BHG believes would either be classified as consumer-type loans rather than commercial loans, the loans fail to meet the credit underwriting standards of BHG but another institution will accept the loans or these are loans to borrowers in certain geographic locations where BHG has elected not to do business. For the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, BHG recognized fee income of $10.0 million and $7.4 million, respectively, from these activities. \nPinnacle Bank also has accommodations with upstream correspondent banks for unsecured short-term advances which aggregate $140.0 million. These accommodations have various covenants related to their term and availability, and in most cases must be repaid within less than a month. There were no outstanding borrowings under these agreements at December 31, 2016, or during the year then ended under such agreements, although we test the availability of these accommodations annually. Pinnacle Bank also has approximately $1.85 billion in available Federal Reserve discount window lines of credit.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02 Leases guidance requiring the recognition in the statement of financial position of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. The guidance requires that a lessee should recognize lease assets and lease liabilities as compared to previous GAAP that did not require lease assets and lease liabilities to be recognized for most leases. The guidance becomes effective for us on January 1, 2019. Pinnacle Financial is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n \u00b7 +/- 400 basis point change in interest rates \n \u00b7 Approximately $95.6 million, or 69.9%, of these revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to gains on the sale of commercial loans BHG had previously issued to doctor, dentist and other medical practices compared to $71.0 million or 49.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015. BHG refers to this activity as its core product. BHG typically funds these loans from cash reserves on its balance sheet. Subsequently, these core product loans are sold with limited or no recourse to BHG to a network of community banks and other financial institutions at a premium to the par value of the loan. The purchaser may access a BHG cash reserve account of up to 3% of the loan balance to support loan payments. BHG retains no servicing or other responsibilities related to the core product loan once sold. As a result, this gain on sale premium represents BHG's compensation for absorbing the costs to originate the loan as well as marketing expenses associated with maintaining its business model. At December 31, 2016, there were $1.2 billion in core product loans previously sold by BHG that were actively serviced by BHG's bank network of purchasers. \nThe following table classifies our fixed and variable rate loans at December 31, 2016 according to contractual maturities of (1) one year or less, (2) after one year through five years, and (3) after five years. The table also classifies our variable rate loans pursuant to the contractual repricing dates of the underlying loans (dollars in thousands):\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur efficiency ratio (ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income) was 53.0% in fiscal year 2016 compared to 52.9% in fiscal year 2015 and 55.5% in fiscal year 2014. The efficiency ratio measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue.\n \u00b7 +/- 300 basis point change in interest rates \nOn November 16, 2016, Pinnacle Financial completed the issuance, through a private placement, of $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due November 16, 2026 (the \"Pinnacle Financial Notes\") to certain institutional accredited investors. The Pinnacle Financial Notes bear a fixed interest rate of 5.25 percent per annum until November 16, 2021 subject to prior approval of the Federal Reserve, payable semi-annually in arrears. From November 16, 2021, the Pinnacle Financial Notes will bear a floating rate of interest equal to 3-Month LIBOR + 3.884 percent per annum until their maturity on November 16, 2026, or such earlier redemption date, payable quarterly in arrears. The Pinnacle Financial Notes will be redeemable by the Company, in whole or in part, on or after November 16, 2021 or, in whole but not in part, upon the occurrence of certain specified tax events, capital events or investment company events. The Pinnacle Financial Notes are not subject to redemption at the option of the holders. The sale of the Pinnacle Financial Notes yielded net proceeds of approximately $118.3 million, and the Pinnacle Financial Notes qualify initially as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes. The Company used approximately $57 million of the net proceeds to retire all of the outstanding debt under the Company's $75 million revolving credit facility entered into in March 2016. The Company has contributed $50.0 million of the net proceeds to Pinnacle Bank and has returned the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes. The foregoing description does not purport to be a complete description of the Pinnacle Financial Notes.\nChanges in net interest income are attributed to either changes in average balances (volume change) or changes in average rates (rate change) for earning assets and sources of funds on which interest is received or paid. Volume change is calculated as change in volume times the previous rate while rate change is change in rate times the previous volume. The change attributed to rates and volumes (change in rate times change in volume) is considered above as a change in volume.\nWe believe we have hired experienced relationship managers that have significant client portfolios and longstanding reputations within the communities we serve. As such, we believe they will attract more relationship managers to our firm as well as loans and deposits from new and existing small-and middle-market clients as the economies in our principal markets continue to expand.\n\nAllowance for Loan Losses (allowance). Our management assesses the adequacy of the allowance prior to the end of each calendar quarter. This assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance. The level of the allowance is based upon management's evaluation of the loan portfolio, loan loss experience, asset quality trends, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers' ability to repay the loan (including the timing of future payment), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors, including regulatory recommendations. The level of allowance maintained is believed by management to be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries of amounts previously charged-off. Allocation of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management's judgment, is deemed to be uncollectible.\n (3) Yields realized on interest-bearing assets less the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest spread calculation excludes the impact of demand deposits. Had the impact of demand deposits been included, the net interest spread for the year ended December 31, 2016 would have been 3.61% compared to a net interest spread for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 of 3.66% and 3.74%, respectively. \nIn August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-15 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) intended to reduce the diversity in practice around how certain transactions are classified within the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted with retrospective application. Pinnacle Financial is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\nAllowance for Loan Losses (allowance). We maintain the allowance at a level that our management deems appropriate to adequately cover the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2016, and 2015, our allowance for loan losses was $59.0 million and $65.4 million, respectively, which our management deemed to be adequate at each of the respective dates. The decrease in the allowance for loan losses in 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily the result of improving credit metrics within our portfolio, including the reduction in net charge-offs and an increase in our coverage ratio. Our allowance for loan loss as a percentage of total loans has decreased from 1.00% at December 31, 2015 to 0.70% at December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of recording acquired portfolios at fair value upon acquisition. The allowance for loan losses for purchased loans is calculated similar to that utilized for legacy Pinnacle Bank loans. Pinnacle Financial's accounting policy is to compare the computed allowance for loan losses for purchased loans to the remaining fair value adjustment. If the computed allowance at the loan level is greater than the remaining fair value adjustment, the excess is added to the allowance for loan losses by a charge to the provision for loan losses. The judgments and estimates associated with our allowance determination are described under \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" above.\nOur provision for loan losses was $18.3 million for 2016 compared to $9.2 million in 2015 and $3.6 million in 2014. Provision expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the comparable periods in 2015 and 2014 was impacted by increased charge-offs realized in our consumer portfolio, primarily related to automobile loans. Our net charge-offs were $24.8 million during 2016 compared to $11.1 million in 2015 and $4.2 million in 2014.\nWhen wholesale funding is necessary to complement the company's core deposit base, management determines which source is best suited to address both liquidity risk management and interest rate risk management objectives. We increased our exposure to brokered deposits in 2016 as a measure to diversify wholesale funding sources. The Asset Liability Management Policy institutes limitations on overall wholesale funding reliance and on brokered deposit exposure specifically. Both our overall reliance on wholesale funding and exposure to brokered deposits were well within those policy limitations as of December 31, 2016.\nCommon equity Tier 1 capital will generally consist of common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings plus limited amounts of minority interest in the form of common stock, less goodwill and other specified intangible assets and other regulatory deductions.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) developed as a joint project with the International Accounting Standards Board to remove inconsistencies in revenue requirements and provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues. The ASU's core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-14, which deferred the effective date by one year (i.e., interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017). Early adoption is permitted, but not before the original effective date (i.e., interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016). The ASU may be adopted using either a modified retrospective method or a full retrospective method. Pinnacle Financial intends to adopt the ASU during the first quarter of 2018, as required, using a modified retrospective approach. Pinnacle Financial's preliminary analysis suggests that the adoption of this accounting guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements as the majority of its revenue stream is generated from financial instruments which are not within the scope of this ASU. However, Pinnacle Financial is still evaluating the impact for other fee-based income. The FASB continues to release new accounting guidance related to the adoption of this ASU and the results of Pinnacle Financial's materiality analysis may change based on conclusions reached as to the application of this new guidance.\n\nGenerally, we have classified our funding as core funding or non-core funding. Core funding consists of all deposits other than time deposits issued in denominations of $250,000 or greater. All other funding is deemed to be non-core. Non-core is further segmented between relationship based non-core funding and wholesale funding. The following table represents the balances of our deposits and other funding and the percentage of each type to the total at December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, regarding testing goodwill for impairment provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity does a qualitative assessment and determines it is necessary, or if a qualitative assessment is not performed, it is required to perform a two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit (if any). If, based on a qualitative assessment, an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. The results of our qualitative assessment indicated that the fair value of our reporting unit was more than its carrying value, and accordingly, the two-step goodwill impairment test was not performed.\n\n\nUnder these rules, Tier 1 capital will generally consist of common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings, limited amounts of minority interest in the form of additional Tier 1 capital instruments, and non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, subject to certain eligibility standards, less goodwill and other specified intangible assets and other regulatory deductions. Cumulative preferred stock and trust preferred securities issued after May 19, 2010, will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital, but such securities issued prior to May 19, 2010, including in the case of bank holding companies with less than $15.0 billion in total assets, trust preferred securities issued prior to that date, will continue to count as Tier 1 capital subject to certain limitations. Upon consummation of our proposed merger with BNC, our total assets will exceed $15 billion and as a result of our total assets exceeding $15 billion as a result of a merger, the subordinated debentures we have issued in connection with our trust preferred securities (along with the subordinated debentures BNC has issued in connection with its trust preferred securities) will cease to qualify as Tier 1 capital. We believe these subordinated debentures will continue to qualify as Tier 2 capital. The definition of Tier 2 capital is generally unchanged for most banking organizations, subject to certain new eligibility criteria.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $116.7 million in brokered certificates of deposit compared to $7.3 million in brokered certificates of deposit at December 31, 2015. Historically, we have issued brokered certificates through several different brokerage houses based on competitive bid. Through the Avenue acquisition, we acquired non-reciprocal time deposits issued through the CDARS network. We also obtained $50 million in non-reciprocal insured cash sweep deposits under a two-year $200 million agreement. Typically, these funds have been for varying maturities of up to two years and were issued at rates which were competitive to rates we would be required to pay to attract similar deposits within our local markets as well as rates for FHLB advances of similar maturities. Although we consider these deposits to be a ready source of liquidity under current market conditions, we anticipate that these deposits will continue to represent a small percentage of our total funding in 2017 as we seek to continue maintaining a higher level of core deposits.\nAnother commonly analyzed scenario that we also analyze is a most-likely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management. Separate growth assumptions are developed for loans, investments, deposits, etc. Other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks, yield curve steepening or flattening, or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress our balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios.\n\nNoninterest expense for 2016 compared to 2015 increased by $65.4 million, or 38.3%, primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $34.9 million, resulting from annual merit increases awarded in the first quarter of 2016, and the increase in our associate base. We also realized increases in equipment and occupancy costs due to our mergers. Additionally, merger expense accounted for approximately $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $4.8 million of expense during the same period in 2015. Merger expense during 2016 includes legal costs incurred associated with the Avenue merger to defend ourselves and Avenue's directors in a shareholder suit as well as investigation and other legal costs associated with a former director's alleged improper trading in Avenue common stock. Merger expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, also includes the costs of technical conversions which were completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 for Magna, in the first quarter of 2016 for CapitalMark and in the third quarter of 2016 for Avenue. Associate related expenses such as retention bonuses are also included in these expenses. We do not expect any future merger-related charges due to the acquisitions of CapitalMark and Magna, and we do not expect future merger-related charges due to the acquisition of Avenue, if any, to be significant. However, merger-related charges are expected to be incurred with our proposed acquisition of BNC during 2017. Noninterest expense for 2015 compared to 2014 increased by $34.6 million, or 25.4%, Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $17.6 million, resulting from annual merit increases awarded in the first quarter of 2015, and the increase in our associate base as a result of both organic new hires and new hires resulting from our mergers with CapitalMark and Magna. We also realized increases in equipment and occupancy costs due to our mergers with CapitalMark and Magna. Additionally, merger expenses accounted for approximately $4.8 million of expense during 2015.\nThe increase in total salaries and employee benefits expense in 2016 over 2015 and 2014 is primarily the result of an increase in the number of employees in 2016 over 2015 and 2014. At December 31, 2016, our associate base had expanded to 1,179.5 full-time equivalent associates as compared to 1,058.5 and 764.0 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily resulting from our acquisitions of CapitalMark, Magna and Avenue. We expect salary and employee benefit expenses will continue to rise as we continue to hire more experienced bankers throughout our expanded footprint and if we are able to consummate our proposed acquisition of BNC. Moreover, as we increase in size and now exceed $10 billion in total assets, we also expect our compliance costs, FDIC insurance assessment expense and salaries and benefits costs to increase.\nThe following table presents additional information about our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016, which by their terms have contractual maturity and termination dates subsequent to December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\n\nEarnings simulation model. We believe interest rate risk is best measured by our earnings simulation modeling. Earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next 12 months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations. To limit interest rate risk, we have policy guidelines for our earnings at risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest rates. For changes up or down in rates from management's flat interest rate forecast over the next twelve months, management establishes policy limits in the decline in net interest income for the following scenarios:\n\nOther than those pronouncements discussed above and those which have been recently adopted, there were no other recently issued accounting pronouncements that are expected to materially impact Pinnacle Financial.\n (1) The reciprocating time deposit category consists of deposits we receive from a bank network (the CDARS network) in connection with deposits of our customers in excess of our FDIC coverage limit that we place with the CDARS network. \n(2) Including interest accrued and upaid through December 31, 2016.\nWe computed yields using coupon interest, adding discount accretion or subtracting premium amortization, as appropriate, on a ratable basis over the life of each security. We computed the weighted average yield for each maturity range using the acquisition price of each security in that range.\nLiquidity Risk Management. The purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure that there are sufficient cash flows to satisfy loan demand, deposit withdrawals, and our other needs. Traditional sources of liquidity for a bank include asset maturities and growth in core deposits. A bank may achieve its desired liquidity objectives from the management of its assets and liabilities and by internally generated funding through its operations. Funds invested in marketable instruments that can be readily sold and the continuous maturing of other earning assets are sources of liquidity from an asset perspective. The liability base provides sources of liquidity through attraction of increased deposits and borrowing funds from various other institutions.\nMarket and Liquidity Risk Management\nOn July 30, 2015, Pinnacle Bank issued $60.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2025 (Pinnacle Bank Notes) in a private placement transaction to institutional investors. On March 10, 2016, Pinnacle Bank issued an additional $70.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Pinnacle Bank Notes. The Pinnacle Bank Notes issued on March 10, 2016 were priced at 99.023% of the principal amount per note, for an effective interest rate of 5.125%. The maturity date of the Pinnacle Bank Notes is July 30, 2025, although Pinnacle Bank may redeem some or all of the Pinnacle Bank Notes beginning on the interest payment date of July 30, 2020 and on any interest payment date thereafter at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Pinnacle Bank Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption, subject to the prior approval of the FDIC. Pinnacle Bank may redeem the Pinnacle Bank Notes at any time upon the occurrence of certain tax events, capital events or investment company events.\nResults of operations. Our net interest income increased to $325.0 million for 2016 compared to $236.6 million for 2015 and $193.0 million for 2014. The net interest margin (the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets) for 2016 was 3.70% compared to 3.72% and 3.75% for 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOn March 29, 2016, Pinnacle Financial entered into a revolving credit facility with a bank for borrowings of up to $75 million under a loan agreement Pinnacle Financial entered into with the bank (the \"Loan Agreement\"). Borrowings under the revolving credit facility have been used to fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the Avenue merger and to make capital contributions to Pinnacle Bank. Future borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes including to fund capital contributions to Pinnacle Bank. Pinnacle Financial's borrowings under the Loan Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to 2.25% plus the greater of (i) zero percent (0%) and (ii) the one-month LIBOR rate quoted by the lender. The Loan Agreement also requires Pinnacle Financial to pay a quarterly fee equal to 0.35% per annum on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under this agreement.\nMarketing and business development expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 34.4% greater than in 2015 which was 17.8% greater than in 2014. The primary source of the increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 is related to our advertising and banking sponsorships with a professional sports franchise in Memphis, which was entered into during 2016.\nOther Real Estate Owned. Other real estate owned (OREO), which consists of properties obtained through foreclosure or through deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of loans, is reported at fair value based on appraised value less selling costs, estimated as of the date acquired, with any loss recognized as a charge-off through the allowance for loan losses. Additional OREO losses for subsequent downward valuation adjustments are determined on a specific property basis and are included as a component of other noninterest expense along with holding costs. The fair value of other real estate owned is derived primarily from independent appraisers. Our internal policies generally require OREO properties to be appraised every nine months. Any net gains or losses on disposal realized at the time of disposal are reflected, net, in noninterest income or noninterest expense, as applicable. Significant judgments and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of other real estate owned, and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility, as experienced during the last few years. As a result, the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates used to determine the fair value of other real estate owned.\nNoninterest Income. Our noninterest income is composed of several components, some of which vary significantly between annual periods. Service charges on deposit accounts and other noninterest income generally reflect our growth, while investment services, fees from the origination of mortgage loans, swap fees and gains on the sale of securities will often reflect market conditions and fluctuate from period to period.\nAs noted previously, Pinnacle Bank is a member of the FHLB Cincinnati and, pursuant to a borrowing agreement with the FHLB Cincinnati, has pledged certain assets pursuant to a blanket lien. As such, Pinnacle Bank may use the FHLB Cincinnati as a source of liquidity depending on the firm's ALCO strategies. Additionally, we may pledge additional qualifying assets or reduce the amount of pledged assets with the FHLB Cincinnati to increase or decrease our borrowing capacity at the FHLB Cincinnati. At December 31, 2016, we believe we had an estimated $1.432 billion in additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB Cincinnati. However, incremental borrowings are made via a formal request by Pinnacle Bank and the subsequent approval by the FHLB Cincinnati.\nCommercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and are underwritten based on the ability of the property (in the case of income producing property), or the borrower's business (if owner occupied) to generate sufficient cash flow to amortize the debt. Secondary emphasis is placed upon collateral value and the financial strength of guarantors, if any. Commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. As detailed in the discussion of real estate loans below, the properties securing our commercial real estate portfolio generally are diverse in terms of type and industry and we measure and monitor concentrations regularly. We believe this diversity helps reduce our exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single industry or type of real estate product. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on cash flow, collateral, geography and risk grade criteria. We also utilize third-party experts to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting market areas we serve.\nIncluded in other noninterest income are interchange and other consumer fees, gains from bank-owned life insurance, swap fees earned for the facilitation of derivative transactions for our clients and other items. Interchange revenues increased as a result of increased debit and credit card transactions as compared to the comparable periods in 2015 and 2014 resulting from both acquired and organic growth. As our assets now exceed $10 billion, the interchange revenues we earn will be negatively impacted beginning in the third quarter of 2017 due to the limits on interchange fees permitted under the Durbin Amendment of the Dodd-Frank Act. Other noninterest income included changes in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance which was $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in earnings on these bank-owned life insurance policies resulted primarily from the additional $66.7 million in bank-owned life insurance with terms similar to our existing policies which were added upon acquisition of Avenue. The assets that support these policies are administered by the life insurance carriers and the income we receive (i.e., increases or decreases in the cash surrender value of the policies) on these policies is dependent upon the returns the insurance carriers are able to earn on the underlying investments that support the policies. Earnings on these policies generally are not taxable. Loan swap fees are also included in other noninterest income and increased by $1.3 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and by $2.3 million between 2015 and 2014 as a result of increased market demand for these products in the current rate environment.\n(3) Due to the uncertainty of future interest rates on borrowings under Pinnacle Financial's junior subordinated debentures issued in connection with trust preferred securities sold by affiliated trusts future interest payments on such obligations are not included in the above table. At December 31, 2016, Pinnacle Financial had junior subordinated debentures of approximately $82.5 million outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the interest rate on the junior subordinated debentures issued in connection with trust preferred securities issued in 2003, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively, ranged from 3.33% to 3.79%, 2.00% to 2.40%, 2.26% to 2.65%, 3.36% to 3.81% , respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2016, Pinnacle Financial incurred interest expense of $365,000, $435,000, $488,000 and $1.1 million, respectively, on its junior subordinated debentures issued in 2003, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. See Note 11 \"Investments in Affiliated Companies and Subordinated Debt\" to Pinnacle Financial's consolidated financial statements for further information.\nThe securities bear a floating interest rate based on a spread over 3-month LIBOR which is set each quarter. Distributions are payable quarterly. The Trust Preferred Securities are subject to mandatory redemption upon repayment of the Subordinated Debentures at their stated maturity date or their earlier redemption in an amount equal to their liquidation amount plus accumulated and unpaid distributions to the date of redemption. We guarantee the payment of distributions and payments for redemption or liquidation of the Trust Preferred Securities to the extent of funds held by the Trusts. Pinnacle Financial's obligations under the Subordinated Debentures together with the guarantee and other back-up obligations, in the aggregate, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by Pinnacle Financial of the obligations of the Trusts under the Trust Preferred Securities.\nEconomic value of equity. Our EVE model measures the extent that estimated economic values of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items will change as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, which establishes a base case EVE. To help limit interest rate risk, we have stated policy guidelines for an instantaneous basis point change in interest rates, in the following scenarios:\n \u00b7 gradual change of 200 points; instantaneous change of 200 basis points \nAn impairment allowance is recognized if the fair value of the loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan (recorded investment in the loan is the principal balance plus any accrued interest, net of deferred loan fees or costs and unamortized premium or discount). The impairment is recognized through the provision for loan losses and is a component of the allowance. Loans that are impaired are recorded at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, or if the loan is collateral dependent, at the fair value of the collateral, less estimated disposal costs. If the loan is collateral dependent, the principal balance of the loan is charged-off in an amount equal to the impairment measurement. The fair value of collateral dependent loans is derived primarily from collateral appraisals performed by independent third-party appraisers. Management believes it follows appropriate accounting and regulatory guidance in determining impairment and accrual status of impaired loans.\nWe acquired a 30% membership interest in Bankers Healthcare Group, LLC (BHG) on February 1, 2015 for $75.0 million in cash. On March 1, 2016, we increased our investment in BHG by 19%, for a total investment in BHG of 49%. The additional 19% interest was acquired for an amount of cash equal to $74.1 million and 860,470 shares of Pinnacle Financial common stock.\nAs noted in our critical accounting policies, management assesses the adequacy of the allowance at the end of each calendar quarter. This assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance. The level of the allowance is based upon management's evaluation of the loan portfolios, past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, the views of Pinnacle Bank's regulators, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay (including the timing of future payments), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, historical loss experience, industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change.\nOur allowance for loan losses is composed of the result of two independent analyses pursuant to the provisions of ASC 450-20, Loss Contingencies and ASC 310-10-35, Receivables. The ASC 450-20 analysis is intended to quantify the inherent risks in our performing loan portfolio. The ASC 310-10-35 analysis includes a loan-by-loan analysis of impaired loans, both those reported as nonaccrual and troubled-debt restructurings.\n______________________\nTotal other noninterest expenses increased by $10.4 million to $33.5 million during 2016 when compared to 2015. Included in other noninterest expenses are deposit and lending related expenses, investment and trust sales expenses, FHLB restructuring expense and administrative expenses. Lending expenses increased by $4.3 million primarily as a result of our expanding credit card platform. Administrative and other expenses increased by $3.0 million to $11.9 million during 2016 when compared to 2015. Included in those expenses was an increase of $893,000 in the loss on foreclosed other repossessed assets. Franchise tax expense increased approximately $2.0 million as compared to 2015 as a result of state income tax credits being applied to excise tax in 2016 as compared to franchise tax in 2015. Total other noninterest expenses increased by $7.4 million to $23.2 million during 2015 when compared to 2014. Included in other noninterest expenses are deposit and lending related expenses, investment and trust sales expenses, FHLB restructuring expense and administrative expenses. Lending expenses increased by $3.5 million primarily as a result of our expanding credit card platform and the resulting third-party processing expenses. Administrative and other expenses increased by $2.8 million to $8.9 million during 2015 when compared to 2014. We incurred increases of approximately $1.2 million in regulatory expenses, director fees, legal costs, data processing expenses and insurance expenses primarily as a result of our CapitalMark and Magna acquisitions. We also incurred increases in franchise tax expense of approximately $544,000 due to increased franchise and excise tax obligations resulting from the complete utilization of our state net operating loss. We also experienced an increase of $402,000 in losses on other repossessed assets.", "item_7_text": "The following is our noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 (in thousands):\nA summary of certain aspects of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2016 and 2015 follows:\nGeneral. Our fully diluted net income per common share for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $2.91 compared to fully diluted net income per common share of $2.52 and $2.01 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. At December 31, 2016, loans had increased by $1.907 billion as compared to December 31, 2015.\nOur short-term borrowings (borrowings which mature within the next fiscal year) consist primarily of securities sold under agreements to repurchase (these agreements are typically associated with comprehensive treasury management programs for our clients and provide them with short-term returns on their excess funds) and FHLB Cincinnati advances. Information concerning our short-term borrowings as of and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016 is as follows (in thousands):\nImpairment of Intangible Assets. Long-lived assets, including purchased intangible assets subject to amortization, such as our core deposit intangible asset, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. There are no such assets to be disposed of at December 31, 2016.\nDuring the three years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, Pinnacle Financial recorded income tax expense of $64.2 million, $47.6 million and $35.2 million, respectively. Pinnacle's effective tax rate for the three years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, was 33.5%, 33.3% and 33.3%, respectively, and differs from the combined federal and state income statutory rate primarily due to our investments in bank-qualified municipal securities, our real estate investment trust, participation in Tennessee's Community Investment Tax Credit (CITC) program, bank-owned life insurance and tax savings from our captive insurance subsidiary, offset in part by the limitation on deductibility of meals and entertainment expense and certain merger-related expenses.\nThe following is a discussion of our financial condition at December 31, 2016 and 2015 and our results of operations for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016. The purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from the consolidated financial statements. The following discussion and analysis should be read along with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein.\n \u00b7 gradual change of 100 points; instantaneous change of 100 basis points \nTotal deposits increased from $6.971 billion at December 31, 2015 to $8.759 billion at December 31, 2016. Within our deposits, the ratio of core funding to total deposits decreased slightly from 84.5% at December 31, 2015 to 81.6% at December 31, 2016.\nThese assets are being amortized on an accelerated basis which reflects the anticipated life of the underlying assets. Amortization expense is estimated to decrease from $4.3 million to $1.3 million per year over the next five years with lesser amounts for the remaining amortization period.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank received $29.0 million and $7.2 million in dividends in the aggregate from BHG, which reduced the carrying amount of our investment in BHG while earnings from BHG increase the carrying amount of our investment in BHG. Our proportionate share of earnings from BHG are included in our consolidated tax return. Profits from intercompany transactions are eliminated. Earnings from BHG may fluctuate from period-to-period.\n (4) Net interest margin is the result of net interest income calculated on a tax-equivalent basis divided by average interest earning assets for the period. \nThe following table is a summary of our nonperforming assets and troubled debt restructurings at December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nScheduled loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds, but loan payoffs and deposit flows fluctuate significantly, being influenced by interest rates, general economic conditions and competition. Additionally, debt security investments are subject to prepayment and call provisions that could accelerate their payoff prior to stated maturity. We attempt to price our deposit products to meet our asset/liability objectives consistent with local market conditions. Our ALCO is responsible for monitoring our ongoing liquidity needs. Our regulators also monitor our liquidity and capital resources on a periodic basis.\n \u00b7 Reduced our exposure to fixed rate investment securities in relation to total assets from approximately 23% as of December 31, 2010 to a current position of approximately 11.8% of total assets. This reduction should assist the firm in becoming more asset sensitive over time. \nWe believe current growth in our balance sheet will also assist us in achievement of increased asset sensitivity over time; however, we may also implement a series of actions designed to accelerate our achievement of neutrality or asset sensitivity as conditions warrant.\n\nEmployee benefits and other expenses include costs associated with our 401k plan, health insurance, and payroll taxes. Also, included in employee benefits and other expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, were approximately $11.0 million, $7.3 million and $5.3 million, respectively, of compensation expenses related to equity-based awards, for restricted shares or restricted share units, including those with performance-based vesting criteria. We have not issued stock options since 2008.\nInvestments. Our investment portfolio, consisting primarily of Federal agency bonds, state and municipal securities and mortgage-backed securities, amounted to $1.323 billion and $966.4 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our investment to asset ratio has increased slightly from 11.1% at December 31, 2015 to 11.8% at December 31, 2016. Our investment portfolio serves many purposes including serving as a stable source of income, collateral for public funds and as a potential liquidity source.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income represents the amount by which interest earned on various earning assets exceeds interest paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities and is the most significant component of our revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded net interest income of approximately $325.0 million, which resulted in a net interest margin of 3.70%. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded net interest income of approximately $236.6 million, which resulted in a net interest margin of 3.72%. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded net interest income of approximately $193.0 million, which resulted in a net interest margin of 3.75%.\nResults of Operations\nTraditionally, BHG, at its sole option, may also provide purchasers of these core product loans the ability to substitute the acquired loan with another more recently-issued BHG medical practice loan should the previously-acquired loan become at least 90-days past due as to its monthly payments. This substitution is subject to the purchaser having adhered to the standards of its purchase agreement with BHG. Additionally, all substitutions are subject to the approval by BHG's board of directors. As a result, the reacquired loans are deemed purchase credit impaired and recorded on BHG's balance sheet at the net present value of the loan's anticipated cash flows. BHG will then initiate collection efforts and attempt to restore the reacquired loan to performing status. During 2016, BHG's substitution losses related to these activities totaled approximately $23.4 million. As a result, BHG maintained a liability as of December 31, 2016 of $45.9 million that represents an estimate of the future inherent losses for the outstanding core portfolio that may be subject to future substitution.\nOur interest rate sensitivity modeling incorporates a number of assumptions for both earnings simulation and EVE, including loan and deposit re-pricing characteristics, the rate of loan prepayments, etc. ALCO periodically reviews these assumptions for accuracy based on historical data and future expectations. Our ALCO policy requires that the base scenario assume rates remain flat and is the scenario to which all others are compared in order to measure the change in net interest income and EVE. Policy limits are applied to the results of certain modeling scenarios. While the primary policy scenarios focus is on a twelve month time frame, longer time horizons are also modeled. All policy scenarios assume a static balance sheet, although other scenarios are modeled.\nThe following is a summary of changes in the allowance for loan losses for each of the years in the five year period ended December 31, 2016 and the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans as of the end of each period (in thousands):\nOur funding policies limit the amount of non-core funding we can utilize. Periodically, we may exceed our policy limitations, at which time management will develop plans to bring our core funding ratios back within compliance. As noted in the table above, our core funding as a percentage of total funding decreased from 84.5% at December 31, 2015 to 81.6% at December 31, 2016. Continuing to grow our core deposit base is a key strategic objective of our firm. Our current growth plans contemplate that we may increase our non-core funding amounts from current levels, but we do not currently anticipate that such increases will exceed our internal policies.\n (1) Average balances of nonperforming loans are included in average loan balances. \nImpact of Inflation\nFinancial Condition\nThe number of full-time equivalent employees increased from 764.0 at December 31, 2014 to 1,058.5 at December 31, 2015 and 1,179.5 at December 31, 2016.\nChanges in interest rates also affect our liquidity position. We currently price deposits in response to market rates, and our management intends to continue this policy. If deposits are not priced in response to market rates, a loss of deposits could occur which would negatively affect our liquidity position.\nUnderwriting standards are designed to promote relationship banking rather than transactional banking. Management examines current and projected cash flows to determine the expected ability of a borrower to repay its obligations as agreed. Commercial and industrial loans are primarily underwritten based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and generally are collateralized by business assets and may have a personal guaranty of business principals. Collateral pledged may include the assets being financed or other assets such as accounts receivable, inventory or equipment. Some short-term loans may be advanced on an unsecured basis.\nOur management believes that we have adequate liquidity to meet all known contractual obligations and unfunded commitments, including loan commitments and reasonable borrower, depositor, and creditor requirements over the next twelve months. Our operating lease commitments are primarily related to our branch and headquarters facilities. The terms of these leases expire at various points ranging from 2017 through 2039. At December 31, 2016, our total minimum operating lease commitment was $76.4 million.\nLoans. The composition of loans at December 31 for each of the past five years and the percentage (%) of each segment to total loans are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nThe following table sets forth the amount of our average balances, interest income or interest expense for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the average interest rate for total interest-earning assets and total interest-bearing liabilities, net interest spread and net interest margin for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\nOur allowance for loan losses is adjusted to an amount deemed appropriate to adequately cover probable losses in the loan portfolio based on our allowance for loan loss methodology. Our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans decreased from 1.00% at December 31, 2015 to 0.70% at December 31, 2016, primarily attributable to improvements in the credit quality of our legacy Pinnacle Bank portfolio and as a result of our acquired loan portfolios being recorded at fair value upon acquisition, thus no allowance for loan losses is assigned to these loans as of the date of acquisition. An allowance for loan losses is recorded for purchased loans that have experienced credit deterioration subsequent to acquisition or increases in balances outstanding. As of December 31, 2016, net loans included a net fair value discount of $34.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, the net fair value discount changed as follows:\n \u00b7 gradual change of 300 points; instantaneous change of 300 basis points \n\nOur merger with Avenue was consummated on July 1, 2016. Each holder of Avenue common stock (including restricted shares) received 0.36 shares of Pinnacle Financial's common stock plus $2.00 per share in cash for each share of Avenue common stock held by each shareholder on the closing date. This acquisition increased our market share in the Nashville MSA. We issued approximately 3.76 million shares of our common stock and paid cash consideration of approximately $20.9 million (including payments related to fractional shares) to the Avenue shareholders and approximately $987,000 to holders of 257,639 outstanding unexercised stock options.\nThe amount of time deposits as of December 31, 2016 amounted to $836.9 million. The following table, which includes core, non-core and reciprocal deposits, shows our time deposits in denominations of under $100,000 and those of denominations of $100,000 and greater by category based on time remaining until maturity of (1) three months or less, (2) over three but less than six months, (3) over six but less than twelve months and (4) over twelve months and the weighted average rate for each category (in thousands):\n(1) Includes unpaid interest through the contractual maturity on both fixed and variable rate obligations. The interest included on variable rate obligations is based on interest rates in effect at December 31, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2016, our earnings simulation model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for both the gradual and instantaneous interest rate changes.\nThe following table sets forth, based on management's best estimate, the allocation of the allowance to types of loans as well as the unallocated portion as of December 31 for each of the past five years and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans (in thousands):\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements. At December 31, 2016, we had outstanding standby letters of credit of $131.4 million and unfunded loan commitments outstanding of $3.374 billion. Because these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and many will expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment level does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. If needed to fund these outstanding commitments, Pinnacle Bank has the ability to liquidate Federal funds sold or securities available-for-sale, or on a short-term basis to borrow and purchase Federal funds from other financial institutions. The following table presents additional information about our unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2016, which by their terms, have contractual maturity dates subsequent to December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\n (2) Yields based on the carrying value of those tax exempt instruments are shown on a fully tax equivalent basis. \nShould our common stock price decline or other impairment indicators become known, additional impairment testing of goodwill may be required. Should it be determined in a future period that the goodwill has become impaired, then a charge to earnings will be recorded in the period such determination is made. While we believe that the assumptions utilized in our testing were appropriate, they may not reflect actual outcomes that could occur. Specific factors that could negatively impact the assumptions used include the following: a change in the control premium being realized in the market or a meaningful change in the number of mergers and acquisitions occurring; the amount of expense savings that may be realized in an acquisition scenario; significant fluctuations in our asset/liability balances or the composition of our balance sheet; a change in the overall valuation of the stock market, specifically bank stocks; performance of Southeast U.S. Banks; and Pinnacle Financial's performance relative to peers. Changing these assumptions, or any other key assumptions, could have a material impact on the amount of goodwill impairment, if any.\nThe consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and practices within the banking industry which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation.\nIn January 2017, we completed the public offering of 3.22 million shares of our common stock in a transaction that resulted in net proceeds to us, after deducing underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated other expenses payable by us, of $191.2 million. We have contributed $185.0 million of these net proceeds to our bank subsidiary.\nNoninterest Expense. The following is our noninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 (in thousands):\nIn assessing the adequacy of the allowance, we also consider the results of our ongoing independent loan review process. We undertake this process both to ascertain those loans in the portfolio with elevated credit risk and to assist in our overall evaluation of the risk characteristics of the entire loan portfolio. Our loan review process includes the judgment of management, independent internal loan reviewers, and reviews that may have been conducted by third-party reviewers primarily regulatory examiners. We incorporate relevant loan review results in the allowance.\nCapital Resources. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, our stockholders' equity amounted to $1.497 billion and $1.156 billion, respectively. Approximately $222.2 million of this increase is attributable to shares of Pinnacle Financial Common Stock issued upon our acquisition of Avenue and additional investment in BHG. At December 31, 2016, Pinnacle Bank's common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 9.3%, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 9.3%, the total risk-based capital ratio was 11.2% and the leverage ratio was 9.2%, compared to 9.0%, 9.0%, 10.6% and 8.8% at December 31, 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2016, Pinnacle Financial's common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 7.9%, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 8.6%, the total risk-based capital ratio was 11.9% and the leverage ratio was 8.6%, compared to 8.6%, 9.6%, 11.2% and 9.4% at December 31, 2015, respectively.\nWe then test the resulting allowance by comparing the balance in the allowance to historical trends and industry and peer information. Our management then evaluates the result of the procedures performed, including the results of our testing, and decides on the appropriateness of the balance of the allowance in its entirety. The audit committee of our board of directors approves the allowance for loan loss policy annually and reviews the methodology and approves the resultant allowance prior to the filing of quarterly and annual financial information.\nGiven the positive economic outlook for our current geographic markets, we continue to make loans for commercial construction and development projects. Construction loans are underwritten utilizing independent appraisals, sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates, financial analysis of the developers and property owners, and expectations of the permanent mortgage market, among other items. Construction loans are generally based upon estimates of costs and appraised value associated with the completed project, which may be inaccurate. Construction loans involve the disbursement of funds during construction with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project. Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be sales of developed property, refinancing in the permanent mortgage market, or an interim loan commitment from us until permanent financing is obtained. These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans because their ultimate repayment depends on the satisfactory completion of construction and is sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, general economic conditions and the availability of long-term financing.\nFrom the date of the issuance through July 29, 2020, the Pinnacle Bank Notes will bear interest at the rate of 4.875% per year and will be payable semi-annually in arrears on January 30 and July 30 of each year, beginning on January 30, 2016. From July 30, 2020, the Pinnacle Bank Notes will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the three-month LIBOR rate plus 3.128%, payable quarterly in arrears on each January 30, April 30, July 30, and October 30, beginning on July 30, 2020, through the maturity date or the early redemption date of the Pinnacle Bank Notes.\nWe have four wholly-owned subsidiaries that are statutory business trusts (the Trusts). We are the sole sponsor of the Trusts and acquired each Trust's common securities. The Trusts were created for the exclusive purpose of issuing 30-year capital trust preferred securities and used the proceeds to acquire junior subordinated debentures (Subordinated Debentures) issued by Pinnacle Financial. The sole assets of the Trusts are the Subordinated Debentures. At December 31, 2016, our approximate $2.5 million investment in the Trusts is included in other investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and our approximate $82.5 million obligation is reflected as subordinated debt.\n \u00b7 Reduced the amount of variable rate loans with in-the-money rate floors from $637.8 million as of December 31, 2015 to $469.3 million as of December 31, 2016 \nOverview\nBased upon our evaluation of the loan portfolio, we believe the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to absorb our estimate of inherent losses existing in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2016. While our policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for loan losses, as well as the resultant provision for loan losses charged to operations, are considered adequate by management, they are necessarily approximate and imprecise. There are factors beyond our control, such as conditions in the local and national economy, local real estate market or a particular industry or borrower which may negatively impact, materially, our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and, thus, the resulting provision for loan losses.\nOn January 22, 2016, we entered into the Merger Agreement to acquire BNC and its wholly owned bank subsidiary Bank of North Carolina. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of BNC's common stock will be converted into 0.5235 shares of Pinnacle Financial Common Stock and all of BNC's outstanding stock options that are not exercised prior to the closing will be cashed out for a payment equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the average closing prices of Pinnacle Financial's Common Stock for the ten (10) trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the closing date of the Merger (adjusted for the Exchange Ratio) over the exercise price of each such option and (ii) the number of shares of BNC common stock subject to each such option. Upon consummation of the Merger, we will assume BNC's obligations under its outstanding $60.0 million subordinated notes issued in September 2014 that mature in October 2024. The $50.5 million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated debentures issued by trust affiliates of BNC in connection with the issuance of trust preferred securities will also be assumed in connection with the Merger.\nWe may also use derivative financial instruments to improve the balance between interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities and as one tool to manage our interest rate sensitivity while continuing to meet the credit and deposit needs of our customers. We may also enter into interest rate swaps to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs. These swaps qualify as derivatives, even though they are not designated as hedging instruments.\n \u00b7 +/- 200 basis point change in interest rates \nAll nonaccruing loans are reassigned to a special assets officer who was not responsible for originating the loan. The special assets officer is responsible for developing an action plan designed to minimize our future losses. Typically, these special assets officers review our loan files, interview prior officers assigned to the relationship, meet with borrowers, inspect collateral, reappraise collateral and/or consult with legal counsel. The special assets officer then recommends an action plan to a committee of senior associates including lenders and workout specialists, which could include foreclosing on collateral, restructuring the loan, issuing demand letters or other actions.\n (2) Classified assets as a percentage of Tier 1 capital plus allowance for loan losses. \n(4) Represents interest and principal payments at maturity on Pinnacle Financial's $140.0 million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes (including $20.0 million of subordinated notes assumed in connection with Pinnacle Financial's acquisition of Avenue) and Pinnacle Bank's $130.0 million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes. $120.0 million of Pinnacle Financial's subordinated notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.25% per annum through November 2021, while the $20.0 million of subordinated notes assumed in connection with the Avenue transaction, bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.75% per annun until June 2020. Pinnacle Bank's subordinated notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.875% per annum through July 2020. The amounts representing interest payments on the subordinated notes issued by both Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank for periods after the interest rates are no longer fixed were calculated using the current rates that would be applicable if the floating rate called for by the notes was currently in effect. See Note 11 \"Investments in Affiliated Companies and Subordinated Debt\" to Pinnacle's consolidated financial statements for further information.\nDue to the weakening credit status of a borrower, we may elect to formally restructure certain loans to facilitate a repayment plan that seeks to minimize the potential losses, if any, that we might incur. These loans are considered troubled debt restructurings. If on nonaccruing status as of the date of restructuring, any restructured loan is included in the nonperforming loan balances as discussed above and is classified as an impaired loan. Loans that have been restructured that are on accrual status as of the restructure date are not included in nonperforming loans; however, such loans are still considered impaired.\nThe accounting principles we follow and our methods of applying these principles conform with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and with general practices within the banking industry. In connection with the application of those principles, we have made judgments and estimates which, in the case of the determination of our allowance for loan losses, the valuation of other real estate owned, the assessment of the valuation of deferred tax assets and the assessment of impairment of intangibles, has been critical to the determination of our financial position and results of operations.\n\n\nNet income for 2016 was $127.2 million compared to $95.5 million in net income in 2015 and $70.5 million in 2014. Fully-diluted net income per common share was $2.91 for 2016 compared to $2.52 for 2015 and $2.01 for 2014.\n \u00b7 Participated in interest rate swaps whereby our customers pay a fixed rate which we remit to our counter party while we receive in return a floating rate on these commercial loans. These loans amounted to approximately $667 million at December 31, 2016. Floating rate loans promote an asset sensitive balance sheet. \n\nThe ASC 450-20 portion of the allowance also includes a small unallocated component. We believe that the unallocated amount is warranted for inherent factors that cannot be practically assigned to individual loan categories, such as the imprecision in the overall loss allocation measurement process, the subjectivity risk of not considering all relevant environmental categories and related measurements and imprecision in our credit risk ratings process. The appropriateness of the unallocated component of the allowance is assessed each quarter end based upon changes in the overall business environment not otherwise captured.\nIndustry regulators have defined additional liquidity guidelines, through the issuance of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Modified LCR, for banking institutions greater than $250 billion in assets, and $50 billion in assets respectively, in the United States. These regulatory guidelines became effective January 2015 with phase in over subsequent years and will require these large institutions to follow prescriptive guidance in determining an absolute level of a high quality liquid asset (HQLA) buffer that must be maintained on their balance sheets in order to withstand a potential liquidity crisis event. Although Pinnacle Financial follows the principles outlined in the Interagency Policy Statement on Liquidity Risk Management, issued March 2010, to determine its HQLA buffer, Pinnacle Financial is not currently subject to these regulations. However, these formulas could eventually be imposed on smaller banks, such as Pinnacle Bank, and require an increase in the absolute level of liquidity on our balance sheet, which could result in lower net interest margins for us in future periods.\nThe above information does not consider the impact of scheduled principal payments.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (the ASU), which introduces the current expected credit losses methodology. Among other things, the ASU requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets, including loans and available-for-sale debt securities, held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. The new model will require institutions to calculate all probable and estimable losses that are expected to be incurred through the loan's entire life. ASU 2016-13 also requires the allowance for credit losses for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since origination to be determined in a manner similar to that of other financial assets measured at amortized cost; however, the initial allowance will be added to the purchase price rather than recorded as credit loss expense. The disclosure of credit quality indicators related to the amortized cost of financing receivables will be further disaggregated by year of origination (or vintage). Institutions are to apply the changes through a cumulative-effect adjustment to their retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the standard is effective. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Early application will be permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Pinnacle Financial is currently assessing the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\nProvision expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 has increased as compared to 2015, primarily due to increased charge-offs in our consumer portfolio, primarily related to automobile loans, although the overall amount of the allowance declined. Provision expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased as compared to 2014, primarily due to increased charge-offs in our consumer portfolio, although the overall amount of the allowance declined.\nThe final rules allow banks and their holding companies with less than $250 billion in assets a one-time opportunity to opt-out of a requirement to include unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in their capital calculation. Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank chose to opt-out of this requirement.\nThe following is a summary of our results of operations for 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands except per share data):\n\nThe increase in service charges on deposit accounts in 2016 compared to 2015 and 2014 is primarily related to increased analysis fees on our commercial client accounts and for both periods presented, an increase in our deposit base when compared the prior period, respectively.\nOur allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased from 1.00% at December 31, 2015 to 0.70% at December 31, 2016, largely because the loans we acquired in conjunction with the Avenue merger were reflected at fair value at the acquisition date. Management believes the decrease in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was supported by the credit quality in our loan portfolio despite increasing charge-offs related to automobile financing, which represents a small portion of the total portfolio. The overall methodology used to estimate the allowance for loan losses is consistent with the prior year. For purchased loans (including those acquired in connection with our mergers), the allowance for loan losses subsequent to the acquisition date is consistent with that utilized for legacy Pinnacle Financial loans. Our accounting policy is to compare the computed allowance for loan losses on purchased loans to the remaining fair value adjustment at the individual loan level. If the computed allowance is greater than the remaining fair value adjustment, the excess is added to the allowance for loan losses by a provision for loan losses. Additional provisioning for purchased portfolios results from credit deterioration on the individual loan or from increased borrowings on loans and lines that existed as of the acquisition date.\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment annually and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Our annual assessment date is September 30. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset's fair value.\n \u00b7 gradual change of 400 points; instantaneous change of 400 basis points \n\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our net interest spread was 3.46%, while the net interest margin was 3.70% compared to a net interest spread of 3.55% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 3.65% for the year ended December 31, 2014, and a net interest margin of 3.72% and 3.75%, respectively. Our loan yields grew only slightly between 2016 and 2015 as the competition for quality loans is intense and the market dictates the rate necessary in order to grow volumes, but were further positively impacted by the accretion of the fair value marks recorded in conjunction with our acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2016, total funding rates were more than those rates for the year ended December 31, 2015 by 15 basis points and were more than those rates for the year ended December 31, 2014 by 3 basis points. The net increase was impacted by our acquisitions as their deposit rates were higher, interest rate increases, increased FHLB borrowings, and our subordinated debt issuances during 2016. The subordinated debt instruments qualify as Tier 2 capital.\nRate and Volume Analysis. Net interest income increased by $88.4 million between the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 and by $43.6 million between the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015. The following is an analysis of the changes in our net interest income comparing the changes attributable to rates and those attributable to volumes (in thousands):\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, merger-related charges of $11.7 million and $4.8 million were incurred associated with our acquisitions of Avenue, CapitalMark and Magna. Merger expense during 2016 includes legal costs incurred associated with the Avenue merger to defend ourselves and Avenue's directors in a shareholder suit as well as investigation and other legal costs associated with a former director's alleged improper trading in Avenue common stock. Merger expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, also includes the costs of technical conversions which were completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 for Magna, in the first quarter of 2016 for CapitalMark and in the third quarter of 2016 for Avenue. Associate related expenses such as retention bonuses are also included in these expenses. We do not expect any future merger-related charges due to the acquisitions of CapitalMark and Magna, and we do not expect future merger-related charges due to the acquisition of Avenue, if any, to be significant. However, merger-related charges are expected to be incurred related to our proposed acquisition of BNC during 2017.\nAt December 31, 2016, our EVE model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for the scenarios noted above. However, our policies provide that during certain interest rate cycles, the down basis point rate changes may not be particularly significant given the current slope of the yield curve. Accordingly, we have currently suspended the calculation of the down rate scenarios for EVE measurement for the down 300 and down 400 scenarios.\nLoan Origination Risk Management. We maintain lending policies and procedures designed to maximize lending opportunities within an acceptable level of risk. Management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis. A reporting system supplements the review process by providing management with frequent reports related to loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies and non-performing loans. Diversification in the loan portfolio is measured and monitored as a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions.\nThe sale of the Pinnacle Bank Notes on July 30, 2015 yielded net proceeds of $59.0 million after deducting the placement agents' fees and expenses payable by Pinnacle Bank. Pinnacle Bank used the net proceeds from the July 30, 2015 offering, together with available cash, to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration payable to the shareholders of CapitalMark and Magna in connection with those mergers, to pay the amounts necessary to redeem the preferred shares that each of CapitalMark and Magna had issued to the United States Department of the Treasury in connection with their participation in the Treasury's Small Business Lending Fund and for general corporate purposes. The sale of the Notes on March 10, 2016 yielded net proceeds of approximately $68.4 million after deducting the initial purchasers' discount and expenses payable by Pinnacle Bank. Pinnacle Bank used the net proceeds from the March 1, 2016 offering for general corporate purposes, (including the repayment of short term borrowings of Pinnacle Bank used to pay a portion of the cash portion of the purchase price for the additional equity interests of BHG acquired by Pinnacle Bank on March 1, 2016).\nPotential Problem Loans. Potential problem loans amounted to approximately $114.6 million, or 1.4% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2016, compared to $105.0 million, or 1.6% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2015. Potential problem loans, which are not included in nonperforming loans, represent those loans with a well-defined weakness and where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have doubts about the borrower's ability to comply with present repayment terms. This definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by Pinnacle Bank's primary regulators, for loans classified as substandard or worse, but not considered nonperforming loans. Approximately $4.5 million of potential problem loans were past due at least 30 but less than 90 days as of December 31, 2016.\n\nWe continue to deploy various asset liability management strategies to manage our risk to interest rate fluctuations. We believe margin expansion over both the short and the long term will be challenging due to continued pressure on earning asset yields during this extended period of a low interest rates. Loan pricing for creditworthy borrowers is very competitive in our markets and has limited our ability to increase pricing on new and renewed loans over the last couple of years. We anticipate that this challenging competitive environment will continue in 2017. However, we believe our net interest income should increase in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in average earning asset volumes, primarily loans, as well as the incremental amounts attributable for Avenue. We anticipate funding these increased earning assets by continuing to grow our core deposits, with wholesale and other forms of noncore funding limited to that required to fund the shortfall, if any.\nAt December 31, 2016, we owned $6.1 million in other real estate which we had acquired, usually through foreclosure, from borrowers compared to $5.1 million at December 31, 2015; the majority of this real estate is located within our principal markets. We categorize other real estate owned into three types: developed lots, undeveloped land, and other. Included in the \"other\" category are primarily condominiums, office buildings and residential homes that are not new construction. The following table shows the amounts of our other real estate owned in such categories (in thousands):\nFinancial Condition. Our loan balances increased by $1.907 billion during 2016 compared to an increase of $1.953 billion in 2015. The increase in our outstanding loan balances is the result of our acquisitions, as well as the continued economic growth in our other Tennessee markets, increases in the number of relationship advisors and increased focus on attracting new customers to our company.\nUnder these rules, the leverage and risk-based capital ratios of bank holding companies may not be lower than the leverage and risk-based capital ratios for insured depository institutions. These rules refined the definition of what constitutes \"capital\" for purposes of calculating those ratios, including the definitions of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. The minimum capital level requirements applicable to bank holding companies and banks subject to the rules are: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions. The rules also establish a \"capital conservation buffer\" of 2.5% (to be phased in over three years) above the new regulatory minimum risk-based capital ratios, and result in the following minimum ratios once the capital conservation buffer is fully phased in: (i) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%. The phase in of the capital conservation buffer began in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increases each year on January 1st until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if capital levels fall below minimum levels plus the buffer amounts. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.\nWe follow the same credit policies and underwriting practices when making these commitments as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. Each customer's creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis and the amount of collateral obtained, if any, is based on management's credit evaluation of the customer. However, should the commitments be drawn upon and should our customers default on their resulting obligation to us, our maximum exposure to credit loss, without consideration of collateral, is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. At December 31, 2016, we had accrued $1.1 million for the inherent risks associated with off balance sheet commitments.\n (1) Some FHLB advances include variable interest rates and could increase in the future. The table reflects rates in effect as of December 31, 2016. \nWe discontinue the accrual of interest income when (1) there is a significant deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower and full repayment of principal and interest is not expected or (2) the principal or interest is more than 90 days past due, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, we recognized $159,000, $308,000 and $256,000 of interest income from nonperforming loans, reflecting cash payments received from the borrower and our belief, at the time of payment, that the underlying collateral supported the carrying amount of the loans.\n \u00b7 +/- 100 basis point change in interest rates \n\nIncome from equity-method investment is comprised of income from our 49% equity-method investment in BHG. We acquired a 30% investment during the first quarter of 2015 and subsequently increased our investment by 19% in the first quarter of 2016. Income from this equity-method investment was $31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Income from equity-method investment is recorded net of associated expenses, including amortization expense associated with customer lists and other intangible assets of $3.4 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2016, there were $16.8 million of these intangible assets which will be amortized in lesser amounts over the next 19 years. Also included in income from equity-method investment, is accretion income associated with the fair valuation of certain of BHG's liabilities of $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, while no accretion income was recorded in 2015. At December 31, 2016, there were $18.1 million of these liabilities which will be accreted in lesser amounts over the next 10 years.\n\nWe also originate consumer loans, including consumer real-estate loans, where we typically use a computer-based credit scoring analysis to supplement the underwriting process. To monitor and manage consumer loan risk, policies and procedures are developed and modified, as needed, jointly by line and staff personnel. This activity, coupled with relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers, seeks to minimize risk. Additionally, trend and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis. Underwriting standards for home equity loans are heavily influenced by statutory requirements.\nWe also maintain an independent loan review department that reviews and validates the credit risk program on a periodic basis. Results of these reviews are presented to management and the audit committee. The loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel, as well as our policies and procedures.\nThe estimated loan loss allocation for all loan segments also considers management's estimate of probable losses for a number of qualitative factors that have not been considered in the loan migration analysis. The qualitative categories and the measurements used to quantify the risks within each of these categories are subjectively selected by management, but measured by objective measurements period over period. The data for each measurement may be obtained from internal or external sources. The current period measurements are evaluated and assigned a factor commensurate with the current level of risk relative to past measurements over time. The resulting factor is applied to the non-impaired loan portfolio. This amount represents estimated probable inherent credit losses which exist, but have not yet been identified either in our risk rating or impairment process, as of the balance sheet date, and is based upon quarterly trend assessments in portfolio concentrations, policy exceptions, economic conditions, staff performance, independent loan review results, collateral considerations, credit quality, competition and regulatory requirements, enterprise wide risk assessments, and peer group credit quality. The qualitative allowance allocation, as determined by the processes noted above, is increased or decreased for each loan segment based on the assessment of these various qualitative factors.\n \u00b7 BHG will maintain loans on its balance sheet for a period of time prior to sale or transfer to a purchaser. BHG also has an investment portfolio on which it earns interest and dividend income. Net interest income and fees associated with this activity amounted to $20.3 million and $18.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \nALCO may determine that Pinnacle Financial should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and the firm's conclusions as to anticipated interest rate fluctuations in future periods. At present, ALCO has determined that its \"most likely\" rate scenario considers two increases in short-term interest rates in 2017 while the longer end of the rate curve will increase only slightly. Our \"most likely\" rate forecast has been basically consistent for several quarters and is based primarily on information we acquire from a service which includes a consensus forecast of numerous benchmarks. As a result, and in preparing for the anticipated rise in interest rates, we have implemented the following strategies:\nEquipment and occupancy expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 28.7% greater than in 2015 which was 13.1% greater than in 2014, primarily due to the locations acquired upon our mergers with Avenue, CapitalMark and Magna. Additionally, one branch was added in the Knoxville MSA in each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016. We intend to expand our footprint by one location in each of the Knoxville, Chattanooga, and Memphis MSAs annually. In future periods, these expansions may lead to higher equipment and occupancy expenses as well as related increases in salaries benefits expense.\nPursuant to the guidance set forth in ASU No. 2011-02, A Creditor's Determination of Whether a Restructuring is a Troubled Debt Restructuring, the above impairment methodology is also applied to those loans identified as troubled debt restructurings.\nOur efficiency ratio (the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income) was 53.0%, 52.9% and 55.5% for the three years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The efficiency ratio measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance to Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 Stock Compensation Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Activity intended to simplify and improve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of such awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is expected to impact Pinnacle Financial's consolidated financial statements by requiring that all income tax effects related to settlements of share-based payment awards be reported as increases (or decreases) to income tax expense. Previously, income tax benefits at settlement of an award were reported as an increase (or decrease) to additional paid-in capital. The ASU also requires that all income tax related cash flows resulting from share-based payments be reported as operating activities in the statement of cash flows whereas cash flows were previously reported as a reduction to operating cash flows and an increase to financing cash flows. The guidance became effective for us on January 1, 2017.\nLending Concentrations. We periodically analyze our commercial loan portfolio to determine if a concentration of credit risk exists to any one or more industries. We use broadly accepted industry classification systems in order to classify borrowers into various industry classifications. We have a credit exposure (loans outstanding plus unfunded commitments) exceeding 25% of Pinnacle Bank's total risk-based capital to borrowers in the following industries at December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nThe following table shows the carrying value of investment securities according to contractual maturity classifications of (1) one year or less, (2) after one year through five years, (3) after five years through ten years, and (4) after ten years. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities of mortgage-backed securities because the mortgages underlying the securities may be called or prepaid with or without penalty. Therefore, these securities are not included in the maturity categories but are listed below these categories as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nNoninterest income for 2016 compared to 2015 increased by $34.5 million, or 39.8%. The increase was primarily due to income from our investment in BHG, which was $31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Income from equity method investment represents our 30% equity method investment in BHG for the year ended December 31, 2015 and beginning on March 1, 2016 also includes our additional 19% investment in BHG. The additional growth was attributable to our overall increase in our geographic footprint, increased transaction accounts, increased production in our fee-based products such as investments, insurance and trust and net gains on the sale of mortgage loans. The year-over-year growth in net gains on the sale of mortgage loans was attributed to both an increase in the number of mortgage originators as well as the positive impact of the low interest rate environment on mortgage production. Noninterest income for 2015 compared to 2014 increased by $33.9 million, or 64.5%, which was primarily attributable to our 30% equity method investment in BHG. The remaining increase was attributable to increased interchange revenues as well as increased production in our fee-based products such as investments, insurance and trust.\n \u00b7 Reduced the difference between the weighted average floor rate on floating and variable rate to the weighted average contract rate on these type of loans from 0.81% at December 31, 2015 to 0.69% at December 31, 2016. This reduction results in requiring a lesser increase in shorter-term rates for the floors to be overcome, thus making these loans with rate floors more asset sensitive over time. \nIn addition, upon consummation of the Avenue Merger, Pinnacle Financial assumed Avenue's obligations under its outstanding $20.0 million subordinated notes issued in December 2014 that mature in December 2024. The Avenue Subordinated Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.75% per annum until January 1, 2020 and may not be redeemed prior to such date. Beginning on January 1, 2020, if not redeemed on such date, the Avenue Subordinated Notes will bear interest at a floating rate equal to the three-month LIBOR determined on the determination date of the applicable interest period plus 4.95%. Interest on the Avenue Subordinated Notes is payable quarterly in arrears on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year, through December 29, 2024 or the earlier date of redemption of all the Avenue Subordinated Notes. The Avenue Subordinated Notes are not subject to redemption at the option of the holders. These notes qualify as Tier 2 capital. These Avenue Subordinated Notes were recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date, and included a discount of $2.7 million, which will be accreted over the life of these notes.\n\n (1) Approximately $16.7 million and $19.0 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of nonperforming loans included above are currently paying pursuant to their contractual terms. \n\n \u00b7 Executed a series of cash flow hedges involving approximately $200 million in FHLB borrowings at pre-established fixed rates. Fixed rate liabilities also provide for a more asset sensitive balance sheet. \nTo assist in determining the adequacy of our liquidity, we perform a variety of liquidity stress tests including idiosyncratic, systemic and combined scenarios for both moderate and severe events. Liquidity is defined as the ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities. Liquidity management involves maintaining our ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of our customers, both depositors and borrowers. We seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid asset balance to ensure our ability to meet our obligations. The amount of the appropriate minimum liquid asset balance is determined through severe liquidity stress testing as measured by our liquidity coverage ratio calculation. At December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with our liquidity coverage ratio.\nDividends. Pursuant to Tennessee banking law, Pinnacle Bank may not, without the prior consent of the TDFI, pay any dividends to us in a calendar year in excess of the total of its retained net profits for that year plus the retained net profits for the preceding two years. During the year ended December 31, 2016, Pinnacle Bank paid dividends of $27.7 million to us which was within the limits allowed by the TDFI.\n\nIn July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC approved final rules that substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to Pinnacle Bank and Pinnacle Financial. The final rules which became effective on January 1, 2015, implement the regulatory capital reforms of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision reflected in \"Basel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems\" (Basel III) and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nPerforming Loans in Past Due Status. The following table is a summary of our accruing loans that were past due between 30 and 90 days and greater than 90 days as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands):\nSubordinated debt and other borrowings. Pinnacle Bank receives advances from the FHLB Cincinnati, pursuant to the terms of various borrowing agreements, which assist it in the funding of its home mortgage and commercial real estate loan portfolios. Under the borrowing agreements with the FHLB Cincinnati, Pinnacle Bank has pledged certain qualifying residential mortgage loans and, pursuant to a blanket lien, all qualifying commercial mortgage loans as collateral. At December 31, 2016, Pinnacle Bank had received advances from the FHLB totaling $406.3 million. Additionally, Pinnacle Financial recognized a discount on FHLB Cincinnati advances in conjunction with previous acquisitions. The remaining discount was $92,000 at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, the scheduled maturities of these advances and interest rates are as follows (in thousands):\nThe Subordinated Debentures are unsecured, bear interest at a rate equal to the rates paid by the Trusts on the Trust Preferred Securities and mature on the same dates as those noted above for the Trust Preferred Securities. Interest is payable quarterly. We may defer the payment of interest at any time for a period not exceeding 20 consecutive quarters provided that the deferral period does not extend past the stated maturity. During any such deferral period, distributions on the Trust Preferred Securities will also be deferred and our ability to pay dividends on our common shares will be restricted.\nNoninterest expense related to the amortization of intangibles was $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $2.0 million and $948,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The following table outlines our amortizing intangible assets and the related amortizable life of our acquired intangible assets:\nNon-Performing Assets and Troubled Debt Restructurings. At December 31, 2016, we had $33.7 million in nonperforming assets compared to $36.3 million at December 31, 2015. Included in nonperforming assets were $27.6 million in nonperforming loans and $6.1 million in other real estate owned at December 31, 2016 and $29.3 million in nonperforming loans and $7.0 million in other real estate owned at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, there were $15.0 million and $8.1 million, respectively, of troubled debt restructurings that were performing as of the restructured date and remain in a performing status.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had no significant commitments for capital expenditures. However, we expect to expand our footprint by one location in each of the Knoxville, Chattanooga and Memphis MSAs annually and intend to add to our information technology platform and will likely incur significant capital expenditures.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIncome from our wealth management groups (investments, insurance and trust) is also included in noninterest income. For the year ended December 31, 2016, commissions and fees from investment services at our financial advisory unit, Pinnacle Asset Management, a division of Pinnacle Bank were $10.8 million, compared to $10.0 million at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, Pinnacle Asset Management was receiving commissions and fees in connection with approximately $2.2 billion in brokerage assets held with Raymond James Financial Services, Inc. compared to $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2015 and 2014. Insurance commissions were approximately $5.3 million during 2016 and $4.8 million during 2015 and $4.6 million during 2014. Additionally, at December 31, 2016, our trust department was receiving fees on approximately $1.0 billion and $755 million of managed and custodied assets, respectively, compared to approximately $916 million and $675 million at December 31, 2015 and $765 million and $861 million at December 31, 2014.\n\nCapital and Liquidity. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, our capital ratios, including our bank's capital ratios, exceeded regulatory minimum capital requirements. From time to time we may be required to support the capital needs of our bank subsidiary. At December 31, 2016, we had approximately $37.0 million of cash at the holding company which could be used to support our bank. We believe we have various capital raising techniques available to us to provide for the capital needs of our bank, if necessary. In January 2017, we completed a public offering of 3.22 million shares of our common stock in a transaction that resulted in net proceeds to us, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated other expenses payable by us, of approximately $191.2 million. We have contributed $185.0 million of these net proceeds to our bank subsidiary.\nWe acquired CapitalMark Bank and Trust (CapitalMark) on July 31, 2015 and Magna Bank (Magna) on September 1, 2015. We acquired Avenue Financial Holdings, Inc. (Avenue) and its bank subsidiary Avenue Bank on July 1, 2016. At the acquisition date, CapitalMark's net assets were fair valued at $73.2 million, including loans of $857.5 million and deposits valued at $953.2 million. At the acquisition date, Magna's net assets were fair valued at $49.1 million, including loans of $440.7 million and deposits valued at $452.7 million. At the acquisition date, Avenue's net assets were preliminarily fair valued at $81.7 million, including loans of $952.5 million and deposits valued at $966.7 million. These acquisitions further expanded our footprint into our core Tennessee markets.\nOur consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016 reflects an increase of $1.907 billion in outstanding loans to $8.450 billion and an increase of $1.788 billion in total deposits to $8.759 billion from December 31, 2015. Total assets were $11.195 billion at December 31, 2016 as compared to $8.715 billion at December 31, 2015. We acquired loans of $952.5 million and deposits totaling $966.7 million upon our acquisition of Avenue in 2016. Collectively, we acquired $1.298 billion in loans and $1.406 billion in deposits upon our acquisitions of CapitalMark and Magna in 2015.\nThe allowance for loan losses for purchased loans is calculated similar to that utilized for our legacy loans. Our accounting policy is to compare the computed allowance for loan losses for purchased loans to any remaining fair value adjustment on a loan-by-loan basis. If the computed allowance is greater than the remaining fair value adjustment, the excess is added to the allowance for loan losses by a provision for loan losses.\n(*)Daily floating rate loans are tied to Pinnacle Bank's prime lending rate or a national interest rate index with the underlying loan rates changing in relation to changes in these indexes. Included in variable rate loans are $469 million of loans which are currently priced at their contractual floors with a weighted average rate of 4.55%. The weighted average contractual rate on these loans is 3.86% As a result, interest income on these loans will not change until the contractual rate on the underlying loan exceeds the interest rate floor.\nImpacting the provision for loan losses in any accounting period are several factors including the change in outstanding loan balances, the level of charge-offs and recoveries, the changes in the amount of impaired loans, changes in the risk ratings assigned to our loans, results of regulatory examinations, credit quality comparison to peer banks, the industry at large, and, ultimately, the results of our quarterly assessment of the inherent risks of our loan portfolio including past loan loss experience.\nEach of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how our net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors) which limit changes in interest rates. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates. ALCO reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies.\nIncome Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2016, Pinnacle Financial recorded income tax expense of $64.2 million. Our effective income tax rate was 33.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 33.3% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, which is principally impacted by our investments in bank-qualified municipal securities, our real estate investment trust, participation in the Tennessee CITC program, and bank-owned life insurance, offset in part by the limitation on deductibility of meals and entertainment expense and certain merger-related expenses. In the event the federal corporate tax rate decreases, as is currently being discussed in Congress, we would be required to write down the value of our deferred tax asset, which would negatively impact income tax expense. Our net deferred tax assets were $49.8 million at December 31, 2016.\nOur objective is to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. Our Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) is charged with the responsibility of monitoring these policies, which are designed to ensure acceptable composition of asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management.\nBased on information gathered from these various modeling scenarios management believes that as of December 31, 2016, our balance sheet would likely be asset sensitive.\nWe have experienced growth in all segments of our portfolio. At December 31, 2016, our loan portfolio composition remained relatively consistent with the composition at December 31, 2015. Despite the acquisitions that were completed during 2015 and 2016, we believe that loan growth in 2017 in the commercial real estate - mortgage segment will outpace loan payoffs in that segment of the portfolio resulting in an increase in the percentage of commercial real estate - mortgage loans as a percentage of total loans. The commercial real estate - mortgage category includes owner-occupied commercial real estate loans. At December 31, 2016, approximately 42.4% of the outstanding principal balance of our commercial real estate - mortgage loans was secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate properties. Owner-occupied commercial real estate is similar in many ways to our commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses on the basis of the cash flows of the business rather than on the valuation of the real estate. Growth in the construction and development loan segment reflects the development of the local economies in which we operate and is diversified between commercial, residential and land.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we paid $24.7 million in dividends to common shareholders. On January 17, 2017 our board of directors declared a $0.14 quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders which should approximate $7.0 million in aggregate dividend payments that will be paid on February 24, 2017 to common shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 3, 2017. The amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, is subject to board discretion and will depend on our earnings, capital position, financial condition and other factors, including new regulatory capital requirements, as they become known to us.\nAs our ownership interest in BHG is 49%, we do not consolidate BHG's results of operations or financial position into our financial statements but record the net result of BHG's activities at our percentage ownership in income from equity method investment in noninterest income. For the year ended December 31, 2016, BHG reported $136.7 million in gross revenues compared to $144.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The following discussion considers BHG's results of operations for 2016 and 2015 prior to consideration of our ownership interest.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates. ALCO measures and evaluates the interest rate risk so that we can meet customer demands for various types of loans and deposits. ALCO determines the most appropriate amounts of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items. Measurements which we use to help us manage interest rate sensitivity include an earnings simulation model and an economic value of equity (EVE) model.\nUpon consummation of our proposed merger with BNC, we will assume BNC's obligations under its outstanding $60.0 million subordinated notes issued in September 2014 that mature in October 2024. These notes bear interest at a rate of 5.5% per annum until September 30, 2019 and may not be repaid prior to that date. Beginning on October 1, 2019, if not redeemed on that date, these notes will bear interest at a floating rate equal to the three-month LIBOR determined on the determination date of the applicable interest period plus 359 basis points. The $50.5 million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated debentures issued by trust affiliates of BNC in connection with the issuance of trust preferred securities will also be assumed in connection with our merger with BNC.\nAs part of our asset liability policy, to manage our interest rate risk, we utilize various strategies in order to achieve our goals. During 2015, Pinnacle Bank prepaid one of its previously restructured FHLB advances resulting in $481,000 in debt extinguishment expense. No prepayments occurred in 2016.\nThe second component of the allowance for loan losses is determined pursuant to ASC 310-10-35. Loans are impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Collection of all amounts due according to the contractual terms means collecting all interest and principal payments of a loan as scheduled in the loan agreement. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change. Loan losses are charged off when management believes that the full collectability of the loan is unlikely. A loan may be partially charged-off after a \"confirming event\" has occurred which serves to validate that full repayment pursuant to the terms of the loan is unlikely.\nThe ASC 450-20 component of the allowance for loan losses begins with a migration analysis based on our internal system of risk rating, if applicable, and historical loss data in our portfolio, by loan type. The migration analysis accumulates losses realized over a rolling four-quarter cycle and is utilized to determine an annual loss rate for each category for each quarter-end in our look-back period. The look-back period in our migration analysis includes 24 quarters as we believe this period is representative of an economic cycle. The loss rates for each category are then averaged and applied to the end of period loan portfolio balances to determine estimated losses. The estimated losses by category are then adjusted by a specifically-determined loss emergence period for each type of loan in our portfolio. A loss emergence period represents the length of time from the initial event which triggered the loss to the recognition of the loss by Pinnacle Bank. Combined, the loss rates and loss emergence period provide a quantitative estimate of credit losses inherent in our end of period loan portfolio based on our actual loss experience.\nDeposits and Other Borrowings. We had approximately $6.971 billion of deposits at December 31, 2015 compared to $8.759 billion at December 31, 2016. Our deposits consist of noninterest and interest-bearing demand accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and time deposits. Additionally, we entered into agreements with certain customers to sell certain of our securities under agreements to repurchase the security the following day. These agreements (which are typically associated with comprehensive treasury management programs for our commercial clients and provide the client with short-term returns for their excess funds) amounted to $85.7 million at December 31, 2016 and $79.1 million at December 31, 2015. Additionally, at December 31, 2016, we had borrowed $406.3 million in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (FHLB Cincinnati) compared to $300.3 million at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, we had an estimated $1.432 billion in additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB Cincinnati; however, incremental borrowings are made via a formal request by us and the subsequent approval by the FHLB Cincinnati.\nThe decrease in the overall allowance for loan losses is due to the improvement in the larger segments of our loan portfolio, which is largely influenced by the overall improvement in the economy in our current geographic markets. Net charge-offs in the consumer portfolio have remained elevated in 2016, primarily due to the non-prime automobile portfolio. The balance of the non-prime automobile portfolio continues to decrease period over period. The allocation by category is determined based on the assigned risk rating, if applicable, and qualitative factors applicable to each category of loans. For impaired loans, those loans are reviewed for a specific allowance allocation. Specific valuation allowances related to impaired loans were approximately $1.1 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $5.2 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily related to the resolution of impaired loans with a specific allowance in 2016. The unallocated category is intended to allow for losses that are inherent in our portfolio that we have not yet identified or attributable to a specific risk factor and for modeling imprecision. Additional information on the allocation of the allowance between performing and impaired loans is provided in Note 6 to the \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\"\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for loan losses that, in management's evaluation, we believe to be adequate to provide coverage for the inherent losses on outstanding loans. The provision for loan losses amounted to approximately $18.3 million, $9.2 million, and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nGains on mortgage loans sold, net, consists of fees from the origination and sale of residential mortgage loans. These mortgage fees are for loans originated in our current markets that are subsequently sold to third-party investors. Substantially all of these loan sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer. Generally, mortgage origination fees increase in lower interest rate environments and more robust housing markets and decrease in rising interest rate environments and more challenging housing markets. Mortgage origination fees will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as the rate environment changes. Gains on mortgage loans sold, net, were $15.8 million, $7.7 million and $5.6 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The increase between each of the periods is attributable to the strong economy in our markets, the continued low interest rate environment and additional personnel in our production unit in 2016 when compared to 2015 and 2014. We hedge a portion of our mortgage pipeline as part of a mandatory delivery program. There is a strong positive correlation between the size of the mortgage pipeline and the value of this hedge. The hedge is not designated as a hedge for GAAP purposes and, as such, changes in its fair value are recorded directly thru the income statement. Therefore, the size of the outstanding mortgage pipeline at any reporting period will directly impact the amount of revenue recorded for mortgage loans held for sale in any one period. During 2016, we realized an increase in the volume of loans included in the mortgage pipeline, and therefore recognized a gain on the change in the fair market value of the hedge. Decreases in the volume of loans included in the mortgage pipeline are likely to negatively impact the gains we recognize as a result of this program.\n\n\nWhile our policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for loan losses, as well as the resultant provision for loan losses charged to operations, are considered adequate by management and are reviewed from time to time by our regulators, they are necessarily approximate and inherently imprecise. There are factors beyond our control, such as conditions in the local, national, and international economy, a local real estate market or particular industry conditions which may negatively impact materially our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and thus the resulting provision for loan losses.\nThe Trust Preferred Securities may be redeemed prior to maturity at our option. The Trust Preferred Securities may also be redeemed at any time in whole (but not in part) in the event of unfavorable changes in laws or regulations that result in (1) the Trust becoming subject to federal income tax on income received on the Subordinated Debentures, (2) interest payable by the parent company on the Subordinated Debentures becoming non-deductible for federal tax purposes, (3) the requirement for the Trust to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or (4) loss of the ability to treat the Trust Preferred Securities as \"Tier I capital\" under the Federal Reserve capital adequacy guidelines.\nWe believe that cash and equity incentives are a valuable tool in motivating an employee base that is focused on providing our clients effective financial advice and increasing shareholder value. As a result, and unlike many other financial institutions, all of our non-commissioned associates participate in our annual cash incentive plan, and all of our associates participate in our equity compensation plans. Under the annual cash incentive plan, the targeted level of incentive payments requires achievement of a certain soundness threshold and a targeted level of revenues and earnings (subject to certain adjustments). To the extent that the soundness threshold is met and revenues and earnings are above or below the targeted amount, the aggregate incentive payments are increased or decreased. Historically, we have paid between 0% and 125% of our targeted incentives. In 2016, our cash incentives represented 90% of targeted incentive compensation compared to 100% in 2015 and 123% in 2014.\n \u00b7 Additionally, BHG will also refer loans to other financial institutions and, based an agreement with the institution, earn a fee for doing so. Typically, these are loans that BHG believes would either be classified as consumer-type loans rather than commercial loans, the loans fail to meet the credit underwriting standards of BHG but another institution will accept the loans or these are loans to borrowers in certain geographic locations where BHG has elected not to do business. For the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, BHG recognized fee income of $10.0 million and $7.4 million, respectively, from these activities. \nPinnacle Bank also has accommodations with upstream correspondent banks for unsecured short-term advances which aggregate $140.0 million. These accommodations have various covenants related to their term and availability, and in most cases must be repaid within less than a month. There were no outstanding borrowings under these agreements at December 31, 2016, or during the year then ended under such agreements, although we test the availability of these accommodations annually. Pinnacle Bank also has approximately $1.85 billion in available Federal Reserve discount window lines of credit.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02 Leases guidance requiring the recognition in the statement of financial position of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. The guidance requires that a lessee should recognize lease assets and lease liabilities as compared to previous GAAP that did not require lease assets and lease liabilities to be recognized for most leases. The guidance becomes effective for us on January 1, 2019. Pinnacle Financial is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n \u00b7 +/- 400 basis point change in interest rates \n \u00b7 Approximately $95.6 million, or 69.9%, of these revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to gains on the sale of commercial loans BHG had previously issued to doctor, dentist and other medical practices compared to $71.0 million or 49.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015. BHG refers to this activity as its core product. BHG typically funds these loans from cash reserves on its balance sheet. Subsequently, these core product loans are sold with limited or no recourse to BHG to a network of community banks and other financial institutions at a premium to the par value of the loan. The purchaser may access a BHG cash reserve account of up to 3% of the loan balance to support loan payments. BHG retains no servicing or other responsibilities related to the core product loan once sold. As a result, this gain on sale premium represents BHG's compensation for absorbing the costs to originate the loan as well as marketing expenses associated with maintaining its business model. At December 31, 2016, there were $1.2 billion in core product loans previously sold by BHG that were actively serviced by BHG's bank network of purchasers. \nThe following table classifies our fixed and variable rate loans at December 31, 2016 according to contractual maturities of (1) one year or less, (2) after one year through five years, and (3) after five years. The table also classifies our variable rate loans pursuant to the contractual repricing dates of the underlying loans (dollars in thousands):\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur efficiency ratio (ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income) was 53.0% in fiscal year 2016 compared to 52.9% in fiscal year 2015 and 55.5% in fiscal year 2014. The efficiency ratio measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue.\n \u00b7 +/- 300 basis point change in interest rates \nOn November 16, 2016, Pinnacle Financial completed the issuance, through a private placement, of $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due November 16, 2026 (the \"Pinnacle Financial Notes\") to certain institutional accredited investors. The Pinnacle Financial Notes bear a fixed interest rate of 5.25 percent per annum until November 16, 2021 subject to prior approval of the Federal Reserve, payable semi-annually in arrears. From November 16, 2021, the Pinnacle Financial Notes will bear a floating rate of interest equal to 3-Month LIBOR + 3.884 percent per annum until their maturity on November 16, 2026, or such earlier redemption date, payable quarterly in arrears. The Pinnacle Financial Notes will be redeemable by the Company, in whole or in part, on or after November 16, 2021 or, in whole but not in part, upon the occurrence of certain specified tax events, capital events or investment company events. The Pinnacle Financial Notes are not subject to redemption at the option of the holders. The sale of the Pinnacle Financial Notes yielded net proceeds of approximately $118.3 million, and the Pinnacle Financial Notes qualify initially as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes. The Company used approximately $57 million of the net proceeds to retire all of the outstanding debt under the Company's $75 million revolving credit facility entered into in March 2016. The Company has contributed $50.0 million of the net proceeds to Pinnacle Bank and has returned the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes. The foregoing description does not purport to be a complete description of the Pinnacle Financial Notes.\nChanges in net interest income are attributed to either changes in average balances (volume change) or changes in average rates (rate change) for earning assets and sources of funds on which interest is received or paid. Volume change is calculated as change in volume times the previous rate while rate change is change in rate times the previous volume. The change attributed to rates and volumes (change in rate times change in volume) is considered above as a change in volume.\nWe believe we have hired experienced relationship managers that have significant client portfolios and longstanding reputations within the communities we serve. As such, we believe they will attract more relationship managers to our firm as well as loans and deposits from new and existing small-and middle-market clients as the economies in our principal markets continue to expand.\n\nAllowance for Loan Losses (allowance). Our management assesses the adequacy of the allowance prior to the end of each calendar quarter. This assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance. The level of the allowance is based upon management's evaluation of the loan portfolio, loan loss experience, asset quality trends, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers' ability to repay the loan (including the timing of future payment), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors, including regulatory recommendations. The level of allowance maintained is believed by management to be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries of amounts previously charged-off. Allocation of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management's judgment, is deemed to be uncollectible.\n (3) Yields realized on interest-bearing assets less the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest spread calculation excludes the impact of demand deposits. Had the impact of demand deposits been included, the net interest spread for the year ended December 31, 2016 would have been 3.61% compared to a net interest spread for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 of 3.66% and 3.74%, respectively. \nIn August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-15 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) intended to reduce the diversity in practice around how certain transactions are classified within the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted with retrospective application. Pinnacle Financial is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\nAllowance for Loan Losses (allowance). We maintain the allowance at a level that our management deems appropriate to adequately cover the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2016, and 2015, our allowance for loan losses was $59.0 million and $65.4 million, respectively, which our management deemed to be adequate at each of the respective dates. The decrease in the allowance for loan losses in 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily the result of improving credit metrics within our portfolio, including the reduction in net charge-offs and an increase in our coverage ratio. Our allowance for loan loss as a percentage of total loans has decreased from 1.00% at December 31, 2015 to 0.70% at December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of recording acquired portfolios at fair value upon acquisition. The allowance for loan losses for purchased loans is calculated similar to that utilized for legacy Pinnacle Bank loans. Pinnacle Financial's accounting policy is to compare the computed allowance for loan losses for purchased loans to the remaining fair value adjustment. If the computed allowance at the loan level is greater than the remaining fair value adjustment, the excess is added to the allowance for loan losses by a charge to the provision for loan losses. The judgments and estimates associated with our allowance determination are described under \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" above.\nOur provision for loan losses was $18.3 million for 2016 compared to $9.2 million in 2015 and $3.6 million in 2014. Provision expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the comparable periods in 2015 and 2014 was impacted by increased charge-offs realized in our consumer portfolio, primarily related to automobile loans. Our net charge-offs were $24.8 million during 2016 compared to $11.1 million in 2015 and $4.2 million in 2014.\nWhen wholesale funding is necessary to complement the company's core deposit base, management determines which source is best suited to address both liquidity risk management and interest rate risk management objectives. We increased our exposure to brokered deposits in 2016 as a measure to diversify wholesale funding sources. The Asset Liability Management Policy institutes limitations on overall wholesale funding reliance and on brokered deposit exposure specifically. Both our overall reliance on wholesale funding and exposure to brokered deposits were well within those policy limitations as of December 31, 2016.\nCommon equity Tier 1 capital will generally consist of common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings plus limited amounts of minority interest in the form of common stock, less goodwill and other specified intangible assets and other regulatory deductions.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) developed as a joint project with the International Accounting Standards Board to remove inconsistencies in revenue requirements and provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues. The ASU's core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-14, which deferred the effective date by one year (i.e., interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017). Early adoption is permitted, but not before the original effective date (i.e., interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016). The ASU may be adopted using either a modified retrospective method or a full retrospective method. Pinnacle Financial intends to adopt the ASU during the first quarter of 2018, as required, using a modified retrospective approach. Pinnacle Financial's preliminary analysis suggests that the adoption of this accounting guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements as the majority of its revenue stream is generated from financial instruments which are not within the scope of this ASU. However, Pinnacle Financial is still evaluating the impact for other fee-based income. The FASB continues to release new accounting guidance related to the adoption of this ASU and the results of Pinnacle Financial's materiality analysis may change based on conclusions reached as to the application of this new guidance.\n\nGenerally, we have classified our funding as core funding or non-core funding. Core funding consists of all deposits other than time deposits issued in denominations of $250,000 or greater. All other funding is deemed to be non-core. Non-core is further segmented between relationship based non-core funding and wholesale funding. The following table represents the balances of our deposits and other funding and the percentage of each type to the total at December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, regarding testing goodwill for impairment provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity does a qualitative assessment and determines it is necessary, or if a qualitative assessment is not performed, it is required to perform a two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit (if any). If, based on a qualitative assessment, an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. The results of our qualitative assessment indicated that the fair value of our reporting unit was more than its carrying value, and accordingly, the two-step goodwill impairment test was not performed.\n\n\nUnder these rules, Tier 1 capital will generally consist of common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings, limited amounts of minority interest in the form of additional Tier 1 capital instruments, and non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, subject to certain eligibility standards, less goodwill and other specified intangible assets and other regulatory deductions. Cumulative preferred stock and trust preferred securities issued after May 19, 2010, will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital, but such securities issued prior to May 19, 2010, including in the case of bank holding companies with less than $15.0 billion in total assets, trust preferred securities issued prior to that date, will continue to count as Tier 1 capital subject to certain limitations. Upon consummation of our proposed merger with BNC, our total assets will exceed $15 billion and as a result of our total assets exceeding $15 billion as a result of a merger, the subordinated debentures we have issued in connection with our trust preferred securities (along with the subordinated debentures BNC has issued in connection with its trust preferred securities) will cease to qualify as Tier 1 capital. We believe these subordinated debentures will continue to qualify as Tier 2 capital. The definition of Tier 2 capital is generally unchanged for most banking organizations, subject to certain new eligibility criteria.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $116.7 million in brokered certificates of deposit compared to $7.3 million in brokered certificates of deposit at December 31, 2015. Historically, we have issued brokered certificates through several different brokerage houses based on competitive bid. Through the Avenue acquisition, we acquired non-reciprocal time deposits issued through the CDARS network. We also obtained $50 million in non-reciprocal insured cash sweep deposits under a two-year $200 million agreement. Typically, these funds have been for varying maturities of up to two years and were issued at rates which were competitive to rates we would be required to pay to attract similar deposits within our local markets as well as rates for FHLB advances of similar maturities. Although we consider these deposits to be a ready source of liquidity under current market conditions, we anticipate that these deposits will continue to represent a small percentage of our total funding in 2017 as we seek to continue maintaining a higher level of core deposits.\nAnother commonly analyzed scenario that we also analyze is a most-likely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management. Separate growth assumptions are developed for loans, investments, deposits, etc. Other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks, yield curve steepening or flattening, or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress our balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios.\n\nNoninterest expense for 2016 compared to 2015 increased by $65.4 million, or 38.3%, primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $34.9 million, resulting from annual merit increases awarded in the first quarter of 2016, and the increase in our associate base. We also realized increases in equipment and occupancy costs due to our mergers. Additionally, merger expense accounted for approximately $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $4.8 million of expense during the same period in 2015. Merger expense during 2016 includes legal costs incurred associated with the Avenue merger to defend ourselves and Avenue's directors in a shareholder suit as well as investigation and other legal costs associated with a former director's alleged improper trading in Avenue common stock. Merger expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, also includes the costs of technical conversions which were completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 for Magna, in the first quarter of 2016 for CapitalMark and in the third quarter of 2016 for Avenue. Associate related expenses such as retention bonuses are also included in these expenses. We do not expect any future merger-related charges due to the acquisitions of CapitalMark and Magna, and we do not expect future merger-related charges due to the acquisition of Avenue, if any, to be significant. However, merger-related charges are expected to be incurred with our proposed acquisition of BNC during 2017. Noninterest expense for 2015 compared to 2014 increased by $34.6 million, or 25.4%, Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $17.6 million, resulting from annual merit increases awarded in the first quarter of 2015, and the increase in our associate base as a result of both organic new hires and new hires resulting from our mergers with CapitalMark and Magna. We also realized increases in equipment and occupancy costs due to our mergers with CapitalMark and Magna. Additionally, merger expenses accounted for approximately $4.8 million of expense during 2015.\nThe increase in total salaries and employee benefits expense in 2016 over 2015 and 2014 is primarily the result of an increase in the number of employees in 2016 over 2015 and 2014. At December 31, 2016, our associate base had expanded to 1,179.5 full-time equivalent associates as compared to 1,058.5 and 764.0 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily resulting from our acquisitions of CapitalMark, Magna and Avenue. We expect salary and employee benefit expenses will continue to rise as we continue to hire more experienced bankers throughout our expanded footprint and if we are able to consummate our proposed acquisition of BNC. Moreover, as we increase in size and now exceed $10 billion in total assets, we also expect our compliance costs, FDIC insurance assessment expense and salaries and benefits costs to increase.\nThe following table presents additional information about our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016, which by their terms have contractual maturity and termination dates subsequent to December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\n\nEarnings simulation model. We believe interest rate risk is best measured by our earnings simulation modeling. Earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next 12 months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations. To limit interest rate risk, we have policy guidelines for our earnings at risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest rates. For changes up or down in rates from management's flat interest rate forecast over the next twelve months, management establishes policy limits in the decline in net interest income for the following scenarios:\n\nOther than those pronouncements discussed above and those which have been recently adopted, there were no other recently issued accounting pronouncements that are expected to materially impact Pinnacle Financial.\n (1) The reciprocating time deposit category consists of deposits we receive from a bank network (the CDARS network) in connection with deposits of our customers in excess of our FDIC coverage limit that we place with the CDARS network. \n(2) Including interest accrued and upaid through December 31, 2016.\nWe computed yields using coupon interest, adding discount accretion or subtracting premium amortization, as appropriate, on a ratable basis over the life of each security. We computed the weighted average yield for each maturity range using the acquisition price of each security in that range.\nLiquidity Risk Management. The purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure that there are sufficient cash flows to satisfy loan demand, deposit withdrawals, and our other needs. Traditional sources of liquidity for a bank include asset maturities and growth in core deposits. A bank may achieve its desired liquidity objectives from the management of its assets and liabilities and by internally generated funding through its operations. Funds invested in marketable instruments that can be readily sold and the continuous maturing of other earning assets are sources of liquidity from an asset perspective. The liability base provides sources of liquidity through attraction of increased deposits and borrowing funds from various other institutions.\nMarket and Liquidity Risk Management\nOn July 30, 2015, Pinnacle Bank issued $60.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2025 (Pinnacle Bank Notes) in a private placement transaction to institutional investors. On March 10, 2016, Pinnacle Bank issued an additional $70.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Pinnacle Bank Notes. The Pinnacle Bank Notes issued on March 10, 2016 were priced at 99.023% of the principal amount per note, for an effective interest rate of 5.125%. The maturity date of the Pinnacle Bank Notes is July 30, 2025, although Pinnacle Bank may redeem some or all of the Pinnacle Bank Notes beginning on the interest payment date of July 30, 2020 and on any interest payment date thereafter at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Pinnacle Bank Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption, subject to the prior approval of the FDIC. Pinnacle Bank may redeem the Pinnacle Bank Notes at any time upon the occurrence of certain tax events, capital events or investment company events.\nResults of operations. Our net interest income increased to $325.0 million for 2016 compared to $236.6 million for 2015 and $193.0 million for 2014. The net interest margin (the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets) for 2016 was 3.70% compared to 3.72% and 3.75% for 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOn March 29, 2016, Pinnacle Financial entered into a revolving credit facility with a bank for borrowings of up to $75 million under a loan agreement Pinnacle Financial entered into with the bank (the \"Loan Agreement\"). Borrowings under the revolving credit facility have been used to fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the Avenue merger and to make capital contributions to Pinnacle Bank. Future borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes including to fund capital contributions to Pinnacle Bank. Pinnacle Financial's borrowings under the Loan Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to 2.25% plus the greater of (i) zero percent (0%) and (ii) the one-month LIBOR rate quoted by the lender. The Loan Agreement also requires Pinnacle Financial to pay a quarterly fee equal to 0.35% per annum on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under this agreement.\nMarketing and business development expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 34.4% greater than in 2015 which was 17.8% greater than in 2014. The primary source of the increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 is related to our advertising and banking sponsorships with a professional sports franchise in Memphis, which was entered into during 2016.\nOther Real Estate Owned. Other real estate owned (OREO), which consists of properties obtained through foreclosure or through deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of loans, is reported at fair value based on appraised value less selling costs, estimated as of the date acquired, with any loss recognized as a charge-off through the allowance for loan losses. Additional OREO losses for subsequent downward valuation adjustments are determined on a specific property basis and are included as a component of other noninterest expense along with holding costs. The fair value of other real estate owned is derived primarily from independent appraisers. Our internal policies generally require OREO properties to be appraised every nine months. Any net gains or losses on disposal realized at the time of disposal are reflected, net, in noninterest income or noninterest expense, as applicable. Significant judgments and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of other real estate owned, and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility, as experienced during the last few years. As a result, the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates used to determine the fair value of other real estate owned.\nNoninterest Income. Our noninterest income is composed of several components, some of which vary significantly between annual periods. Service charges on deposit accounts and other noninterest income generally reflect our growth, while investment services, fees from the origination of mortgage loans, swap fees and gains on the sale of securities will often reflect market conditions and fluctuate from period to period.\nAs noted previously, Pinnacle Bank is a member of the FHLB Cincinnati and, pursuant to a borrowing agreement with the FHLB Cincinnati, has pledged certain assets pursuant to a blanket lien. As such, Pinnacle Bank may use the FHLB Cincinnati as a source of liquidity depending on the firm's ALCO strategies. Additionally, we may pledge additional qualifying assets or reduce the amount of pledged assets with the FHLB Cincinnati to increase or decrease our borrowing capacity at the FHLB Cincinnati. At December 31, 2016, we believe we had an estimated $1.432 billion in additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB Cincinnati. However, incremental borrowings are made via a formal request by Pinnacle Bank and the subsequent approval by the FHLB Cincinnati.\nCommercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and are underwritten based on the ability of the property (in the case of income producing property), or the borrower's business (if owner occupied) to generate sufficient cash flow to amortize the debt. Secondary emphasis is placed upon collateral value and the financial strength of guarantors, if any. Commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. As detailed in the discussion of real estate loans below, the properties securing our commercial real estate portfolio generally are diverse in terms of type and industry and we measure and monitor concentrations regularly. We believe this diversity helps reduce our exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single industry or type of real estate product. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on cash flow, collateral, geography and risk grade criteria. We also utilize third-party experts to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting market areas we serve.\nIncluded in other noninterest income are interchange and other consumer fees, gains from bank-owned life insurance, swap fees earned for the facilitation of derivative transactions for our clients and other items. Interchange revenues increased as a result of increased debit and credit card transactions as compared to the comparable periods in 2015 and 2014 resulting from both acquired and organic growth. As our assets now exceed $10 billion, the interchange revenues we earn will be negatively impacted beginning in the third quarter of 2017 due to the limits on interchange fees permitted under the Durbin Amendment of the Dodd-Frank Act. Other noninterest income included changes in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance which was $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in earnings on these bank-owned life insurance policies resulted primarily from the additional $66.7 million in bank-owned life insurance with terms similar to our existing policies which were added upon acquisition of Avenue. The assets that support these policies are administered by the life insurance carriers and the income we receive (i.e., increases or decreases in the cash surrender value of the policies) on these policies is dependent upon the returns the insurance carriers are able to earn on the underlying investments that support the policies. Earnings on these policies generally are not taxable. Loan swap fees are also included in other noninterest income and increased by $1.3 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and by $2.3 million between 2015 and 2014 as a result of increased market demand for these products in the current rate environment.\n(3) Due to the uncertainty of future interest rates on borrowings under Pinnacle Financial's junior subordinated debentures issued in connection with trust preferred securities sold by affiliated trusts future interest payments on such obligations are not included in the above table. At December 31, 2016, Pinnacle Financial had junior subordinated debentures of approximately $82.5 million outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the interest rate on the junior subordinated debentures issued in connection with trust preferred securities issued in 2003, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively, ranged from 3.33% to 3.79%, 2.00% to 2.40%, 2.26% to 2.65%, 3.36% to 3.81% , respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2016, Pinnacle Financial incurred interest expense of $365,000, $435,000, $488,000 and $1.1 million, respectively, on its junior subordinated debentures issued in 2003, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. See Note 11 \"Investments in Affiliated Companies and Subordinated Debt\" to Pinnacle Financial's consolidated financial statements for further information.\nThe securities bear a floating interest rate based on a spread over 3-month LIBOR which is set each quarter. Distributions are payable quarterly. The Trust Preferred Securities are subject to mandatory redemption upon repayment of the Subordinated Debentures at their stated maturity date or their earlier redemption in an amount equal to their liquidation amount plus accumulated and unpaid distributions to the date of redemption. We guarantee the payment of distributions and payments for redemption or liquidation of the Trust Preferred Securities to the extent of funds held by the Trusts. Pinnacle Financial's obligations under the Subordinated Debentures together with the guarantee and other back-up obligations, in the aggregate, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by Pinnacle Financial of the obligations of the Trusts under the Trust Preferred Securities.\nEconomic value of equity. Our EVE model measures the extent that estimated economic values of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items will change as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, which establishes a base case EVE. To help limit interest rate risk, we have stated policy guidelines for an instantaneous basis point change in interest rates, in the following scenarios:\n \u00b7 gradual change of 200 points; instantaneous change of 200 basis points \nAn impairment allowance is recognized if the fair value of the loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan (recorded investment in the loan is the principal balance plus any accrued interest, net of deferred loan fees or costs and unamortized premium or discount). The impairment is recognized through the provision for loan losses and is a component of the allowance. Loans that are impaired are recorded at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, or if the loan is collateral dependent, at the fair value of the collateral, less estimated disposal costs. If the loan is collateral dependent, the principal balance of the loan is charged-off in an amount equal to the impairment measurement. The fair value of collateral dependent loans is derived primarily from collateral appraisals performed by independent third-party appraisers. Management believes it follows appropriate accounting and regulatory guidance in determining impairment and accrual status of impaired loans.\nWe acquired a 30% membership interest in Bankers Healthcare Group, LLC (BHG) on February 1, 2015 for $75.0 million in cash. On March 1, 2016, we increased our investment in BHG by 19%, for a total investment in BHG of 49%. The additional 19% interest was acquired for an amount of cash equal to $74.1 million and 860,470 shares of Pinnacle Financial common stock.\nAs noted in our critical accounting policies, management assesses the adequacy of the allowance at the end of each calendar quarter. This assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance. The level of the allowance is based upon management's evaluation of the loan portfolios, past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, the views of Pinnacle Bank's regulators, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay (including the timing of future payments), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, historical loss experience, industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change.\nOur allowance for loan losses is composed of the result of two independent analyses pursuant to the provisions of ASC 450-20, Loss Contingencies and ASC 310-10-35, Receivables. The ASC 450-20 analysis is intended to quantify the inherent risks in our performing loan portfolio. The ASC 310-10-35 analysis includes a loan-by-loan analysis of impaired loans, both those reported as nonaccrual and troubled-debt restructurings.\n______________________\nTotal other noninterest expenses increased by $10.4 million to $33.5 million during 2016 when compared to 2015. Included in other noninterest expenses are deposit and lending related expenses, investment and trust sales expenses, FHLB restructuring expense and administrative expenses. Lending expenses increased by $4.3 million primarily as a result of our expanding credit card platform. Administrative and other expenses increased by $3.0 million to $11.9 million during 2016 when compared to 2015. Included in those expenses was an increase of $893,000 in the loss on foreclosed other repossessed assets. Franchise tax expense increased approximately $2.0 million as compared to 2015 as a result of state income tax credits being applied to excise tax in 2016 as compared to franchise tax in 2015. Total other noninterest expenses increased by $7.4 million to $23.2 million during 2015 when compared to 2014. Included in other noninterest expenses are deposit and lending related expenses, investment and trust sales expenses, FHLB restructuring expense and administrative expenses. Lending expenses increased by $3.5 million primarily as a result of our expanding credit card platform and the resulting third-party processing expenses. Administrative and other expenses increased by $2.8 million to $8.9 million during 2015 when compared to 2014. We incurred increases of approximately $1.2 million in regulatory expenses, director fees, legal costs, data processing expenses and insurance expenses primarily as a result of our CapitalMark and Magna acquisitions. We also incurred increases in franchise tax expense of approximately $544,000 due to increased franchise and excise tax obligations resulting from the complete utilization of our state net operating loss. We also experienced an increase of $402,000 in losses on other repossessed assets.", "item_7_tables": "Table 51: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>

and $70.5 million in 2014. Earnings per share also increased.\n- Total assets grew to $11.2 billion at December 31, 2016 from $8.7 billion at December 31, 2015, primarily due to loan and deposit growth.\n- Completed mergers with Avenue, CapitalMark, and Magna in recent years to expand footprint.\n\nFinancial Condition\n- Loans increased by $1.9 billion during 2016 compared to 2015. Deposits increased by $1.8 billion.\n- Allowance for loan losses decreased as a percentage of total loans due to loan growth and improved credit quality. \n- Goodwill increased due to Avenue acquisition but no impairment was deemed necessary based on qualitative assessment.\n\nResults of Operations\n- Net interest income increased in 2016 compared to prior years due to loan growth. Net interest margin slightly decreased. \n- Noninterest income increased mainly due to higher income from BHG equity investment. Other increases due to expanded footprint.\n- Noninterest expenses rose significantly in 2016 largely due to higher salaries, benefits costs, merger charges, and other costs.\n\nMarket and Liquidity Risk Management\n- Interest rate risk and liquidity risk are closely monitored and modeled under various rate scenarios. Steps taken to improve interest rate sensitivity.\n- Liquidity is sufficient to meet known obligations and commitments. Numerous funding sources available if needed.\n\nCapital Resources\n- Capital ratios exceeded regulatory minimums and increased tangible book value per share.\n- Recently completed a common stock offering that bolstered capital levels.  \n\nIn summary, earnings and profitability increased thanks to loan growth, higher noninterest income, and mergers. Some margin pressure seen but overall performance remains sound."}
