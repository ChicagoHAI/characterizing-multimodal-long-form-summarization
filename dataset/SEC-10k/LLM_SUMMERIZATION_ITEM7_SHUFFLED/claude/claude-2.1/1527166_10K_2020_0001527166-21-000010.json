MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOn January 1, 2020, we completed our conversion from a Delaware limited partnership named The Carlyle Group L.P. into a Delaware corporation named The Carlyle Group Inc. Pursuant to the Conversion, at the specified effective time on January 1, 2020, each common unit of The Carlyle Group L.P. outstanding immediately prior to the effective time converted into one share of common stock of The Carlyle Group Inc. and each special voting unit and general partner unit was canceled for no consideration. In addition, holders of the partnership units in Carlyle Holdings I L.P., Carlyle Holdings II L.P., and Carlyle Holdings III L.P. exchanged such units for an equivalent number of shares of common stock and certain other restructuring steps occurred (the conversion, together with such restructuring steps and related transactions, the Conversion\u201d).\nUnless the context suggests otherwise, references in this report to Carlyle,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d and our\u201d refer (i) prior to the consummation of the Conversion to The Carlyle Group L.P. and its consolidated subsidiaries and (ii) from and after the consummation of the Conversion to The Carlyle Group Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. References to our common stock in periods prior to the Conversion refer to the common units of The Carlyle Group L.P.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe conduct our operations through three operating segments: Global Private Equity, Global Credit, and Investment Solutions.\n\u2022Global Private Equity - Our Global Private Equity segment advises our 34 buyout and middle market and growth capital funds, our 10 U.S. and internationally focused real estate funds, our 14 natural resources funds, and our three Legacy Energy funds. The segment also includes three NGP Predecessor Funds and five NGP Carry Funds advised by NGP. As of December 31, 2020, our Global Private Equity segment had $131.8 billion in AUM and $91.6 billion in Fee-earning AUM.\n\u2022Global Credit - Our Global Credit segment advises a group of 71 funds that pursue investment strategies including loans and structured credit, direct lending, opportunistic credit, distressed credit, and aircraft financing and servicing. As of December 31, 2020, our Global Credit segment had $55.9 billion in AUM and $42.1 billion in Fee-earning AUM.\n\u2022Investment Solutions - Our Investment Solutions segment advises global private equity and real estate fund of funds programs and related co-investment and secondary activities across 283 fund vehicles. As of December 31, 2020, our Investment Solutions segment had $58.1 billion in AUM and $36.4 billion in Fee-earning AUM.\nWe earn management fees pursuant to contractual arrangements with the investment funds that we manage and fees for transaction advisory and oversight services provided to portfolio companies of these funds. We also typically receive a performance fee from an investment fund, which may be either an incentive fee or a special residual allocation of income, which we refer to as a carried interest, in the event that specified investment returns are achieved by the fund. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d), we are required to consolidate some of the investment funds that we advise. However, for segment reporting purposes, we present revenues and expenses on a basis that deconsolidates these investment funds. Accordingly, our segment revenues primarily consist of fund management and related advisory fees and other income, realized performance revenues (consisting of incentive fees and carried interest allocations), realized principal investment income, including realized gains on our investments in our funds and other trading securities, as well as interest income. Our segment expenses primarily consist of cash compensation and benefits expenses, including salaries, bonuses, and realized performance payment arrangements, and general and administrative expenses. While our segment expenses include depreciation and interest expense, our segment expenses exclude acquisition-related charges and amortization of intangibles and impairment. Refer to Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the differences between our financial results reported pursuant to U.S. GAAP and our financial results for segment reporting purposes.\nTrends Affecting our Business\nAggregate economic activity continued to improve through the fourth quarter of 2020, and overall revenue growth among public companies was roughly flat, on average, for the year. However, the pandemic's sharply discrepant impact has increased the dispersion in performance across businesses and industries. During 2020, more than 10% of public companies reported a peak-to-trough fall in revenues of more than 50%, roughly twice the number of businesses reporting losses of this magnitude over any 12-month period during 2008-2009. On the other hand, over 5% of businesses also reported revenue gains in excess of 50%, as remote work and social distancing led businesses to make greater use of video communications technology and households substituted video streaming and durable goods purchases for travel, tourism and live events spending.\nOverall, U.S. business spending, led by software and services, averaged nearly 8% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter of 2020, and our proprietary portfolio data continue to suggest that growth in certain industries such as healthcare and technology also remained robust. In Europe, there was continued growth in the business services and industrials sectors, but a large resurgence in coronavirus cases drove some retrenchment in affected industries and geographies. As has been the case since the onset of the pandemic, the travel, tourism, and hospitality sectors were particularly impacted. U.S. hotel occupancy fell to 37% of capacity in December, the lowest rate since the spring, while new restrictions on movement and business activity in Europe resulted in a modest quarter-over-quarter economic contraction. The U.S. Commerce Department estimates that the U.S. economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.0% in Q4 2020. As a result, gross domestic product (GDP) finished the year 2.5% below year-end 2019 levels and when averaged over the entirety of 2020, GDP contracted by 3.5% relative to 2019. In contrast, China continues to exhibit strong recovery, with economic output ending the fourth quarter 6.5% ahead of year-ago levels.\nGlobal equity markets remained strong in 2020, driven by the sharp decline in interest rates, significant increases in fiscal support, and the sense among market participants that the COVID-19 pandemic reflects a temporary decline in the supply of certain experiences and services rather than an endogenous drop in consumer demand. Over the past year, the S&P 500 rose by roughly 15%, with much larger gains in tech-heavy indexes like the Nasdaq whose constituents have tended to benefit from social distancing and remote work. The global equity markets saw a particularly strong surge from November 6 onwards after the overwhelmingly positive results of COVID-19 vaccine trials were announced. From September 30 through December 31, 2020, the S&P 500, MSCI ACWI, EuroStoxx 600, and Shanghai Composite rose 11.7%, 14.4%, 10.5%, and 7.9%, respectively. Much of this performance, particularly in the U.S., was driven by a rebound in sectors where equity prices had been hardest hit by the pandemic, such as hospitality, financials, brick-and-mortar retail, and oil & gas. In the U.S., analysts currently estimate fourth quarter earnings for companies in the S&P 500 declined 5% year-over-year, with the largest contractions still concentrated in the energy and industrials (including transportation) sectors.\nWhile unexpected resilience in goods consumption, residential real estate markets, and business spending have led to better than expected 2020 global growth outcomes, and the recently enacted and proposed fiscal stimulus measures should help bolster household income, significant risks remain for 2021. In December 2020, total U.S. employment declined for the first time since April after seven consecutive months of gains. The slower than anticipated global vaccination rollout, combined with uncertainties regarding new variants of the virus, will prolong the risk of continued disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic deeper into the year. In Europe, the ongoing re-imposition of broad-based lockdown measures could stymie growth in the near-term, while underlying labor market fragility and debt accumulation pose a potential risk to the longer-term growth outlook for the region. Direct state aid programs have artificially suppressed unemployment rates to date and 5% or more of the workforce is still supported by employment retention programs in some European economies. While many of these policies have been extended through 2021, an eventual labor market shakeout remains a possibility.\nOf particular note are risks to the outlook for the transportation industry where recovery in metrics such as discretionary air travel and public transit ridership lags other macro indicators, and the infrastructure sector, where the pandemic has materially altered revenue expectations and has led to severe projected budget shortfalls at the state and local level. The potential for a sustained period of severely depressed commercial air travel may have significant implications not only for the airlines, but also for the myriad aviation related companies such as aircraft suppliers, their vendors and airport services firms that depend on the aviation industry for a substantial portion of their revenues.\nThe near-term outlook for oil and gas is expected to improve in 2021 as lockdowns are eased and fuel demand rebounds. The long-term outlook for oil and gas will be more dependent on the pace of the broader shift to alternative energy sources. For example, currently over 90% of surface, air and marine transportation is powered by oil-based fuels. While growth in electric vehicle sales should cause this share to decline over time, electric vehicles account for less than 3% of new auto sales, and less than 0.5% of the cars on the road today are fully electric. Additionally, ongoing concerns about climate change and carbon emissions may dampen investor interest in the oil and gas sector which could have a negative impact on our activities in the sector including raising capital, obtaining suitable or sufficient financing, exiting investments and achieving expected returns on new investments.\nGlobal geopolitical tensions, already strained pre-pandemic, have been exacerbated by the widespread economic disruption. U.S.-China relations, which had appeared to ease at the end of 2019, soured during 2020 amid harsh rhetoric, sanctions, and export restrictions. While there is some optimism that tensions with China could ease under the new U.S. Administration, the outlook remains highly uncertain. The imposition of a national security law on Hong Kong has prompted backlash from various global players, thereby increasing overall uncertainty about risks associated with international trade with Hong Kong, the potential for increased taxation on Hong Kong-related transactions, and new regulatory restrictions and data protection concerns for businesses operating in Hong Kong, including our Hong Kong operations. Disputes over digital services taxes and import tariffs on luxury goods imports reignited U.S.-European Union trade tensions, although early signals from the new U.S. Administration suggest a desire to approach existing disagreements diplomatically. Political instability and the potential for a broader pullback in global trade introduce risks to the economic growth of most economies, particularly those with significant export-dependence. Domestically within the U.S., heightened unemployment and deep-seated political divisiveness continue to cause significant uncertainty.\nBond markets, while stable, shifted modestly in the fourth quarter. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose more than 25 basis points over the quarter to its highest level since March on expectations of increased government spending under the new Administration and closely divided Congress. High yield spreads tightened a further 150 basis points. Futures markets continue to expect short-term rates to remain near zero through 2025 due to the Federal Reserve's new policy framework, which appears to allow inflation to overshoot its 2% target for some time.\u201d Within corporate credit, businesses have taken advantage of low interest rates through massive debt issuance and restructurings, building large cash piles as liquidity buffers.\nOur carry fund portfolio continued to build on the strong momentum started in the second half of the year, appreciating 8% in the fourth quarter and 10% for the year. Within our Global Private Equity segment, our corporate private equity funds appreciated by 11% in the fourth quarter and 19% over the last twelve months, reflecting strong performance across the portfolio and our real estate funds appreciated by 3% during the fourth quarter and 8% over the last twelve months. Our natural resources funds appreciated by 3% in the fourth quarter despite continued pressure, with depreciation of 16% over the last twelve months. In our Global Credit segment, our carry funds (which represent approximately 14% of the total Global Credit remaining fair value) appreciated by 7% in the fourth quarter, as tightening spreads led to an increase in value for many of our positions, and depreciated 2% over the last twelve months. Investment Solutions appreciation was 7% in the fourth quarter and 10% for the year, though the valuations of our primary and secondary funds of funds generally reflect investment fair values on a one-quarter lag.\nWith continued positive impact from valuations across the portfolio, net accrued performance revenues on our balance sheet increased to a record $2.3 billion at December 31, 2020, up 36% since last year. Significant IPO activity in our portfolio during 2020 has increased the portion of our traditional carry funds attributable to publicly traded companies to 15% of fair value in the fourth quarter, compared to 6% at the end of 2019. While these IPOs have performed well to date overall, this shift may result in an increasing correlation to public market performance and a significant concentration of investment gains in individual investments for certain funds. To the extent that there is volatility in public equity markets and/or the prices of our publicly-traded portfolio companies, there may be elevated volatility in our performance revenue accrual in the coming quarters.\nGenerally, the investment period of our funds enables us to be patient in deploying capital only in investments that meet our return criteria and the strategic objectives of our funds. During the fourth quarter, our carry funds invested $8.7 billion in new or follow-on transactions and we invested $18.3 billion for the full year 2020. We anticipate that increased market activity and opportunities for large buyouts will facilitate strong deployment activity as we move further into 2021. We also expect volume to remain robust across both growth and buyout opportunities, particularly in the healthcare, technology, and consumer sectors. However, challenges in specific industries could lead to a longer-term slowdown in certain sectors, such as traditional energy.\nWe generated $6.9 billion in realized proceeds from our carry funds in the fourth quarter and realized $21.0 billion in 2020. We expect near-term exit activity in early 2021 to depend on the trajectory of multiple and varied macro environment factors, in addition to valuation multiples and access to capital markets. However, we believe that our recent IPO activity and maturing portfolio position us well to deliver higher levels of both realized proceeds and realized performance revenue over the long term. For example, during the fourth quarter we realized significant performance revenue for a second straight quarter from our sixth U.S. Buyout fund, which reflects the value creation and advancing maturity profile of that flagship fund.\nFundraising has remained generally resilient since the onset of the pandemic. Though we were not fundraising any of our flagship funds in Global Private Equity during 2020, we raised $27.5 billion in new capital in 2020, well exceeding our goal for the year, with particular fundraising strength in Investment Solutions and Global Credit.\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, many observers conflated a return to the office with a return to business as usual. Instead, business volumes and productivity rose to pre-pandemic levels well in advance of full office reopening. Since the start\nof the pandemic, our employees have proven what they can accomplish while they are working remotely, and they remain well connected and engaged with each other and our stakeholders through our suite of teleconferencing and virtual meeting solutions. While we have generally reopened our offices around the globe, most employees continue to work remotely and we continue to successfully operate our business and address the needs of our shareholders, fund investors and portfolio companies.\nWe are closely evaluating the financial and other proposals put forth by the new Administration and Congress and their potential impacts on our business. While there may be changes to current tax and regulatory regimes, additional fiscal stimulus packages could be followed by longer-term spending increases on infrastructure, climate, health care and education. The potential for policy changes may create regulatory uncertainty for our portfolio companies and our investment strategies and adversely affect the profitability of our portfolio companies.\nRecent Transactions\nDividends\nIn February 2021, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share to common stockholders of record at the close of business on February 16, 2021, payable on February 23, 2021.\nConversion to a Corporation\nOn January 1, 2020, we completed our conversion from a Delaware limited partnership named The Carlyle Group L.P. (the Partnership\u201d) into a Delaware corporation named The Carlyle Group Inc. (the Corporation\u201d). Pursuant to the Conversion, at the specified effective time on January 1, 2020, (i) each common unit of the Partnership outstanding immediately prior to the effective time converted into one issued and outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, (ii) each special voting unit of the Partnership outstanding immediately prior to the effective time was canceled for no consideration and the former holder(s) thereof ceased to have any rights with respect thereto and (iii) each general partner unit of the Partnership outstanding immediately prior to the effective time was canceled for no consideration and the former holder(s) thereof ceased to have any rights with respect thereto, in each case without any action required on the part of the Partnership, the Corporation, any holder of any Partnership interest or any other person. In addition, holders of partnership units in Carlyle Holdings I L.P., Carlyle Holdings II L.P. and Carlyle Holdings III L.P. exchanged such units for an equivalent number of shares of common stock of the Corporation and certain other restructuring steps occurred (the conversion, together with such restructuring steps and related transactions, the Conversion\u201d).\nThe Conversion qualified for the non-recognition of gain or loss to our former common unitholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The application of the non-recognition rules to non-U.S. common unitholders in the context of the Conversion is dependent on local tax requirements. Following the Conversion, dividends are reported to stockholders on Form 1099-DIV and are treated as qualified dividend income (generally taxable to U.S. individual stockholders at capital gain rates) paid by a domestic corporation to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes, with any excess dividends treated as return of capital to the extent of the stockholder's basis.\nPrior to the Conversion, we recorded significant non-controlling interests in Carlyle Holdings related to the ownership interests of the limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships. The Company, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, was the sole general partner of Carlyle Holdings. Accordingly, the Company consolidated the financial position and results of operations of Carlyle Holdings into its consolidated financial statements. In the Conversion, the limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships exchanged their Carlyle Holdings partnership units for an equivalent number of shares of common stock of The Carlyle Group Inc. As a result, in periods following Conversion, the consolidated balance sheet of The Carlyle Group Inc. will not reflect any non-controlling interests in Carlyle Holdings. In addition, we expect that our provision for income taxes in periods following the Conversion will be greater than in periods prior to the Conversion because following the Conversion, all of our income before the provision for income taxes will be subject to U.S. federal (and state and local) corporate income taxes. See Part 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors-Following the Conversion, we expect to pay more corporate income taxes than we would have as a limited partnership.\u201d For these reasons, our results in periods following the Conversion may not be comparable to our results in periods prior to the Conversion.\nFor additional information about the Conversion, see Part 1. Item 1. Business-Organizational Structure,\u201d Part II. Item 8. Note 10-Related Party Transactions,\u201d and Part II. Item 8. Note 11-Income Taxes.\u201d\nKey Financial Measures\nOur key financial measures are discussed in the following pages. Additional information regarding these key financial measures and our other significant accounting policies can be found in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenues\nRevenues primarily consist of fund management fees, incentive fees, investment income (including performance allocations, realized and unrealized gains of our investments in our funds and other principal investments), as well as interest and other income.\nFund Management Fees. Fund management fees include management fees and transaction and portfolio advisory fees. We earn management fees for advisory services we provide to funds in which we hold a general partner interest or with which we have an investment advisory or investment management agreement. Additionally, management fees include catch-up management fees, which are episodic in nature and represent management fees charged to fund investors in subsequent closings of a fund which apply to the time period between the fee initiation date and the subsequent closing date. Approximately 90% of our fee revenue is in the form of management fees from traditional closed-end, long-dated funds, which are highly predictable and stable, and do not have significant exposure to the underlying fund valuations.\nManagement fees attributable to Carlyle Partners VII, L.P. ( CP VII\u201d), our seventh U.S. buyout fund with approximately $17.5 billion of Fee-earning AUM as of December 31, 2020, was 17% of total management fees recognized during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and 13% during the year ended December 31, 2018. No other fund generated over 10% of total management fees in the periods presented.\nFund management fees exclude the reimbursement of any partnership expenses paid by the Company on behalf of the Carlyle funds pursuant to the limited partnership agreements, including amounts related to the pursuit of actual, proposed, or unconsummated investments, professional fees, expenses associated with the acquisition, holding and disposition of investments, and other fund administrative expenses.\nTransaction and Portfolio Advisory Fees. Transaction and portfolio advisory fees are fees we receive for the transaction and portfolio advisory services we provide to our portfolio companies. When covered by separate contractual agreements, we recognize transaction and portfolio advisory fees when the service has been provided and collection is reasonably assured. We are required to offset our fund management fees earned by a percentage of the transaction and advisory fees earned, which we refer to as the rebate offsets.\u201d Historically, such rebate offset percentages generally approximated 80% of the fund's portion of the transaction and advisory fees earned. However, the percentage of transaction and portfolio advisory fees we share with our investors on our recent vintage funds has generally increased from 80% to 100% of the fund's portion of the transaction and portfolio advisory fees earned, such that a larger share of the transaction fee revenue we retain is driven by co-investment activity. In addition, GCM generates capital markets fees in connection with activities related to the underwriting, issuance and placement of debt and equity securities, and loan syndication for our portfolio companies and third-party clients, which are generally not subject to rebate offsets with respect to our most recent vintages (but are subject to the rebate offsets set forth above for older funds). Underwriting fees include gains, losses and fees arising from securities offerings in which we participate in the underwriter syndicate. The recognition of transaction fees, portfolio advisory fees, and capital markets fees can be volatile as they are primarily generated by investment activity within our funds, and therefore are impacted by our investment pace.\nIncentive Fees. Incentive fees consist of performance-based incentive arrangements pursuant to management contracts, primarily from certain of our Global Credit funds, when the return on assets under management exceeds certain benchmark returns or other performance targets. In such arrangements, incentive fees are recognized when the performance benchmark has been achieved.\nInvestment Income. Investment income consists of our performance allocations as well as the realized and unrealized gains and losses resulting from our equity method investments and other principal investments.\nPerformance allocations consist principally of the performance-based capital allocation from fund limited partners to us, commonly referred to as carried interest, from certain of our investment funds, which we refer to as the carry funds.\u201d Carried interest revenue is recognized by Carlyle upon appreciation of the valuation of our funds' investments above certain return hurdles as set forth in each respective partnership agreement and is based on the amount that would be due to us pursuant to the fund partnership agreement at each period end as if the funds were liquidated at such date. Accordingly, the amount of carried interest recognized as performance allocations reflects our share of the fair value gains and losses of the associated\nfunds' underlying investments measured at their then-current fair values relative to the fair values as of the end of the prior period. As a result, the performance allocations earned in an applicable reporting period are not indicative of any future period, as fair values are based on conditions prevalent as of the reporting date. Refer to - Trends Affecting our Business\u201d for further discussion.\nIn addition to the performance allocations from our Global Private Equity funds and most of our closed-end carry funds in the Global Credit segment, we are also entitled to receive performance allocations from our Investment Solutions, Carlyle Aviation and NGP Carry Funds. The timing of performance allocations realizations for these funds is typically later than in our other carry funds based on the terms of such arrangements.\nOur performance allocations are generated by a diverse set of funds with different vintages, geographic concentration, investment strategies and industry specialties. For an explanation of the fund acronyms used throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section, see Item 1. Business - Our Family of Funds.\u201d\nPerformance allocations in excess of 10% of the total for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were generated from the following funds:\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CP VI </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,124.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>CP VI </td> <td>$ </td> <td>154.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>CP VI </td> <td>$ </td> <td>162.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CAP IV </td> <td>331.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>CRP V </td> <td>154.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>CRP VII </td> <td>131.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Alpinvest Co - & Secondary Investments 2006-2008 </td> <td>83.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>CEP IV </td> <td>77.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>CEP IV </td> <td>(119.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>CIEP I </td> <td>$ </td> <td>74.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>CP V </td> <td>68.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>CAP IV </td> <td>(245.7) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>CRP V </td> <td>(67.7) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNo other fund generated over 10% of performance allocations in the periods presented above. Performance allocations from CP VI during 2020 were driven by appreciation across the portfolio, with notable increases in the values of the publicly traded investments in the portfolio.\nUnder our arrangements with the historical owners and management team of AlpInvest, we generally do not retain any carried interest in respect of the historical investments and commitments to our fund vehicles that existed as of July 1, 2011 (including any options to increase any such commitments exercised after such date). We are entitled to 15% of the carried interest in respect of commitments from the historical owners of AlpInvest for the period between 2011 and 2020 and 40% of the carried interest in respect of all other commitments (including all future commitments from third parties). In certain instances, carried interest associated with the AlpInvest fund vehicles is subject to entity level income taxes in the Netherlands.\nRealized carried interest may be clawed back or given back to the fund if the fund's investment values decline below certain return hurdles, which vary from fund to fund. When the fair value of a fund's investments remains constant or falls below certain return hurdles, previously recognized performance allocations are reversed. In all cases, each investment fund is considered separately in evaluating carried interest and potential giveback obligations. For any given period, performance allocations revenue on our statement of operations may include reversals of previously recognized performance allocations due to a decrease in the value of a particular fund that results in a decrease of cumulative performance allocations earned to date. Since fund return hurdles are cumulative, previously recognized performance allocations also may be reversed in a period of appreciation that is lower than the particular fund's hurdle rate. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the reversals of performance allocations were $401.5 million, $215.8 million and $364.4 million, respectively. Additionally, unrealized performance allocations reverse when performance allocations are realized, and unrealized performance allocations can be negative if the amount of realized performance allocations exceed total performance allocations generated in the period.\nAs of December 31, 2020, accrued performance allocations and accrued giveback obligations were approximately $5.0 billion and $18.7 million, respectively. Each balance assumes a hypothetical liquidation of the funds' investments at\nDecember 31, 2020 at their then current fair values. These assets and liabilities will continue to fluctuate in accordance with the fair values of the fund investments until they are realized. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $10.6 million of the accrued giveback obligation is the responsibility of various current and former senior Carlyle professionals and other limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships, and the net accrued giveback obligation attributable to Carlyle Holdings is $8.1 million. The Company uses net accrued performance revenues\u201d to refer to the aggregation of the accrued performance allocations and incentive fees net of (i) accrued giveback obligations, (ii) accrued performance allocations and incentive fee-related compensation, (iii) performance allocations and incentive fee-related tax obligations, and (iv) accrued performance allocations and incentive fees attributable to non-controlling interests and excludes any net accrued performance allocations and incentive fees that have been realized but will be collected in subsequent periods. The net accrued performance revenues as of December 31, 2020 are $2.3 billion.\nIn addition, realized performance allocations may be reversed in future periods to the extent that such amounts become subject to a giveback obligation. If at December 31, 2020, all investments held by our carry funds were deemed worthless, a possibility that management views as remote, the amount of realized and previously distributed performance allocations subject to potential giveback would be approximately $0.5 billion, on an after-tax basis where applicable. See the related discussion of Contingent Obligations (Giveback)\u201d within - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nThe following table summarizes the total amount of aggregate giveback obligations that we have realized since Carlyle's inception. Given various current and former senior Carlyle professionals and other limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships are responsible for paying the majority of the realized giveback obligation, the table below also summarizes the amount that was attributable to Carlyle:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Inception through December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total Giveback </td> <td> </td> <td>Giveback Attributable to Carlyle </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Various Legacy Energy Funds </td> <td>$ </td> <td>158.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other Carlyle Funds </td> <td>58.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aggregate giveback since inception </td> <td>$ </td> <td>216.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe funding for employee obligations and givebacks related to carry realized pre-IPO is primarily through a collection of employee receivables related to giveback obligations and from non-controlling interests for their portion of the obligation. The realization of giveback obligations for the Company's portion of such obligations reduces Distributable Earnings in the period realized. Further, each individual recipient of realized carried interest typically signs a guarantee agreement or partnership agreement that personally obligates such person to return his/her pro rata share of any amounts of realized carried interest previously distributed that are later clawed back. Accordingly, carried interest as performance allocation compensation is subject to return to the Company in the event a giveback obligation is funded. Generally, the actual giveback liability, if any, does not become due until the end of a fund's life.\nEach investment fund is considered separately in evaluating carried interest and potential giveback obligations. As a result, performance allocations within funds will continue to fluctuate primarily due to certain investments within each fund constituting a material portion of the carry in that fund. Additionally, the fair value of investments in our funds may have substantial fluctuations from period to period.\nIn addition, in our discussion of our non-GAAP results, we use the term realized net performance revenues\u201d to refer to realized performance allocations and incentive fees from our funds, net of the portion allocated to our investment professionals, if any, and certain tax expenses associated with carried interest attributable to certain partners and employees, which are reflected as realized performance allocations and incentive fees related compensation expense. See - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for the amount of realized performance revenues recognized each period. See - Segment Analysis\u201d for the realized performance revenues by segment and related discussion for each period.\nInvestment income also represents the unrealized and realized gains and losses on our principal investments, including our investments in Carlyle funds that are not consolidated, as well as any interest and other income. Investment income (loss) also includes the related amortization of the basis difference between the carrying value of our investment and our share of the underlying net assets of the investee, as well as the compensation expense associated with compensatory arrangements provided by us to employees of our equity method investee, as it relates to our investments in NGP. Principal investment income also included our proportionate share of U.S. GAAP earnings from our strategic investment in Fortitude Re prior to the contribution\nof our investment to a Carlyle-affiliated investment fund (see Note 5-Investments to the consolidated financial statements) . Realized principal investment income (loss) is recorded when we redeem all or a portion of our investment or when we receive or are due cash income, such as dividends or distributions. A realized principal investment loss is also recorded when an investment is deemed to be worthless. Unrealized principal investment income (loss) results from changes in the fair value of the underlying investment, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains (losses) at the time an investment is realized.\nFair Value Measurement. U.S. GAAP establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework which ranks the observability of market price inputs used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. The observability of inputs is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, the characteristics specific to the financial instrument and the state of the marketplace, including the existence and transparency of transactions between market participants. Financial instruments with readily available quoted prices, or for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in active markets, will generally have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment applied in determining fair value.\nThe table below summarizes the valuation of investments and other financial instruments included within our AUM, by segment and fair value hierarchy levels, as of December 31, 2020:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Global\nPrivate\nEquity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Global Credit </td> <td> </td> <td>Investment\nSolutions </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Results </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level I </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,366 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,895 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,323 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level II </td> <td>8,223 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,362 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,646 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level III </td> <td>76,566 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>153,324 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair Value of Investments </td> <td>89,155 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,649 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,489 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>169,293 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available Capital </td> <td>42,625 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,232 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,619 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76,476 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total AUM </td> <td>$ </td> <td>131,780 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,881 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>58,108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>245,769 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest and Other Income of Consolidated Funds. Interest and other income of Consolidated Funds primarily represents the interest earned on CLO assets. The Consolidated Funds are not the same entities in all periods presented. The Consolidated Funds in future periods may change due to changes in fund terms, formation of new funds, and terminations of funds.\nNet Investment Gains of Consolidated Funds. Net investment gains of Consolidated Funds measures the change in the difference in fair value between the assets and the liabilities of the Consolidated Funds. A gain (loss) indicates that the fair value of the assets of the Consolidated Funds appreciated more (less), or depreciated less (more), than the fair value of the liabilities of the Consolidated Funds. A gain or loss is not necessarily indicative of the investment performance of the Consolidated Funds and does not impact the management or incentive fees received by Carlyle for its management of the Consolidated Funds. The portion of the net investment gains (losses) of Consolidated Funds attributable to the limited partner investors is allocated to non-controlling interests. Therefore a gain or loss is not expected to have a material impact on the revenues or profitability of the Company. Moreover, although the assets of the Consolidated Funds are consolidated onto our balance sheet pursuant to U.S. GAAP, ultimately we do not have recourse to such assets and such liabilities are generally non-recourse to us. Therefore, a gain or loss from the Consolidated Funds generally does not impact the assets available to our equity holders.\nExpenses\nCompensation and Benefits. Compensation includes salaries, bonuses, equity-based compensation, and performance payment arrangements. Bonuses are accrued over the service period to which they relate.\nWe recognize as compensation expense the portion of performance allocations and incentive fees that are due to our employees, senior Carlyle professionals, advisors, and operating executives in a manner consistent with how we recognize the performance allocations and incentive fee revenue. These amounts are accounted for as compensation expense in conjunction with the related performance allocations and incentive fee revenue and, until paid, are recognized as a component of the accrued compensation and benefits liability. Compensation in respect of performance allocations and incentive fees is paid when the related performance allocations and incentive fees are realized, and not when such performance allocations and incentive fees\nare accrued. The funds do not have a uniform allocation of performance allocations and incentive fees to our employees, senior Carlyle professionals and operating executives. Therefore, for any given period, the ratio of performance allocations and incentive fee compensation to performance allocations and incentive fee revenue may vary based on the funds generating the performance allocations and incentive fee revenue for that period and their particular allocation percentages.\nIn addition, we have implemented various equity-based compensation arrangements that require senior Carlyle professionals and other employees to vest ownership of a portion of their equity interests over a service period of generally six months to four years, which under U.S. GAAP will result in compensation charges over current and future periods. Over the past two years, we have granted fewer equity awards to employees than we have previously. For example, in 2018, 2019 and 2020, we granted approximately 13.3 million, 6.7 million and 3.5 million of restricted stock units and other awards, respectively. In February 2021, we granted 6.6 million long-term strategic restricted stock units to certain senior professionals, the majority of which are subject to vesting based on the achievement of annual performance targets over four years. As a result, the number of restricted stock units granted in 2021 will be higher than in 2020, which, combined with a higher share price than in prior periods, will result in higher equity-based compensation expense in the coming years. Compensation charges associated with all equity-based compensation grants are excluded from Fee Related Earnings and Distributable Earnings.\nWe may hire additional individuals and overall compensation levels may correspondingly increase, which could result in an increase in compensation and benefits expense. As a result of acquisitions, we have charges associated with contingent consideration taking the form of earn-outs and profit participation, some of which are reflected as compensation expense.\nGeneral, Administrative and Other Expenses. General, administrative, and other expenses include occupancy and equipment expenses and other expenses, which consist principally of professional fees, including those related to our global regulatory compliance program, external costs of fundraising, travel and related expenses, communications and information services, depreciation and amortization (including intangible asset amortization and impairment) and foreign currency transactions. We expect that general, administrative and other expenses will vary due to infrequently occurring or unusual items, such as impairment of intangible assets and expenses or insurance recoveries associated with litigation and contingencies. Also, in periods of significant fundraising, to the extent that we use third parties to assist in our fundraising efforts, our general, administrative and other expenses may increase accordingly. Additionally, we anticipate that general, administrative and other expenses will fluctuate from period to period due to the impact of foreign exchange.\nWe also could incur additional expenses in the future related to our acquisitions including amortization of acquired intangibles and earn-outs to equity holders. As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, we evaluate our intangible assets (including goodwill) for impairment and could record additional impairment losses in future periods.\nInterest and Other Expenses of Consolidated Funds. The interest and other expenses of Consolidated Funds consist primarily of interest expenses related primarily to our CLO loans, professional fees and other third-party expenses.\nIncome Taxes. Following the Conversion on January 1, 2020, all of the income before provision for income taxes attributable to The Carlyle Group Inc. is subject to U.S. federal, state, and local corporate income taxes. Prior to the Conversion, the Carlyle Holdings partnerships and their subsidiaries primarily operated as pass-through entities for U.S. income tax purposes and recorded a provision for state and local income taxes for certain entities based on applicable laws and a provision for foreign income taxes for certain foreign entities. In addition, Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc. was subject to U.S. income taxes on only a portion of our income or loss. As such, the Company was not responsible for the tax liability due on certain income earned during the year. Such income was taxed at the unitholder and non-controlling interest holder level, and any income tax was the responsibility of the unitholders and was paid at that level. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the impact of the Conversion.\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, using currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period in which the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nIn the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by federal and certain state, local and foreign tax regulators. As of December 31, 2020, our U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2016 through 2019 are open under the normal three-year statute of limitations and therefore subject to examination. State and local tax returns are generally subject to audit from 2014 to 2019. Foreign tax returns are generally subject to audit from 2011 to 2019. Certain of our affiliates are currently under audit by federal, state and foreign tax authorities.\nNon-controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities. Non-controlling interests in consolidated entities represent the component of equity in consolidated entities not held by us. These interests are adjusted for general partner allocations.\nPrior to the Conversion, we recorded significant non-controlling interests in Carlyle Holdings relating to the ownership interests of the limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships. The Company, through wholly owned subsidiaries, was the sole general partner of Carlyle Holdings. Accordingly, the Company consolidated the financial position and results of operations of Carlyle Holdings into its financial statements, and the other ownership interests in Carlyle Holdings are reflected as a non-controlling interest in the Company's financial statements. The limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships exchanged their Carlyle Holdings partnership units for an equivalent number of shares of common stock of The Carlyle Group Inc. as part of the Conversion. As a result, following the Conversion the consolidated balance sheet of The Carlyle Group Inc. does not reflect any non-controlling interests in Carlyle Holdings.\nEarnings Per Common Share. We compute earnings per common share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to the common shares of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per common share reflects the assumed conversion of all dilutive securities. We apply the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive weighted-average common shares represented by unvested restricted stock units. Prior to the Conversion, we applied the if-converted\u201d method to the Carlyle Holdings partnership units to determine the dilutive weighted-average common units outstanding.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nDistributable Earnings. Distributable Earnings, or DE\u201d, is a key performance benchmark used in our industry and is evaluated regularly by management in making resource deployment and compensation decisions, and in assessing the performance of our three segments. We also use DE in our budgeting, forecasting, and the overall management of our segments. We believe that reporting DE is helpful to understanding our business and that investors should review the same supplemental financial measure that management uses to analyze our segment performance. DE is intended to show the amount of net realized earnings without the effects of consolidation of the Consolidated Funds. DE is derived from our segment reported results and is an additional measure to assess performance.\nDistributable Earnings differs from income (loss) before provision for income taxes computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP in that it includes certain tax expenses associated with performance revenues (comprised of performance allocations and incentive fees), and does not include unrealized performance allocations and related compensation expense, unrealized principal investment income, equity-based compensation expense, net income (loss) attributable to non-Carlyle interest in consolidated entities, or charges (credits) related to Carlyle corporate actions and non-recurring items. Charges (credits) related to Carlyle corporate actions and non-recurring items include: charges associated with acquisitions or strategic investments, changes in the tax receivable agreement liability, corporate conversion costs, amortization and any impairment charges associated with acquired intangible assets, transaction costs associated with acquisitions and dispositions, charges associated with earnouts and contingent consideration including gains and losses associated with the estimated fair value of contingent consideration issued in conjunction with acquisitions or strategic investments, impairment charges associated with lease right-of-use assets, gains and losses from the retirement of debt, charges associated with contract terminations and employee severance. We believe the inclusion or exclusion of these items provides investors with a meaningful indication of our core operating performance. This measure supplements and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the results of operations discussed further under -Consolidated Results of Operations\u201d prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nFee Related Earnings. Fee Related Earnings, or FRE\u201d, is a component of DE and is used to assess the ability of the business to cover direct base compensation and operating expenses from total fee revenues. FRE differs from income (loss) before provision for income taxes computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP in that it adjusts for the items included in the calculation of DE and also adjusts DE to exclude net realized performance revenues, realized principal investment income from investments in Carlyle funds, net interest (interest income less interest expense), and certain general, administrative and other expenses when the timing of any future payment is uncertain.\nOperating Metrics\nWe monitor certain operating metrics that are common to the asset management industry.\nFee-earning Assets under Management. Fee-earning assets under management or Fee-earning AUM refers to the assets we manage or advise from which we derive recurring fund management fees. Our Fee-earning AUM is generally based on one of the following, once fees have been activated:\n(a)the amount of limited partner capital commitments, generally for carry funds where the original investment period has not expired, for AlpInvest carry funds during the commitment fee period and for Metropolitan carry funds during the weighted-average investment period of the underlying funds (see Fee-earning AUM based on capital commitments\u201d in the table below for the amount of this component at each period);\n(b)the remaining amount of limited partner invested capital at cost, generally for carry funds and certain co-investment vehicles where the original investment period has expired, Metropolitan carry funds after the expiration of the weighted-average investment period of the underlying funds, and one of our business development companies (see Fee-earning AUM based on invested capital\u201d in the table below for the amount of this component at each period);\n(c)the amount of aggregate fee-earning collateral balance at par of our CLOs and other securitization vehicles, as defined in the fund indentures (typically exclusive of equities and defaulted positions) as of the quarterly cut-off date;\n(d)the external investor portion of the net asset value of certain carry funds (see Fee-earning AUM based on net asset value\u201d in the table below for the amount of this component at each period);\n(e)the gross assets (including assets acquired with leverage), excluding cash and cash equivalents, of one of our business development companies and certain carry funds (see Fee-earning AUM based on lower of cost or fair value and other\u201d in the table below for the amount of this component at each period); and\n(f)the lower of cost or fair value of invested capital, generally for AlpInvest carry funds where the commitment fee period has expired and certain carry funds where the investment period has expired, (see Fee-earning AUM based on lower of cost or fair value and other\u201d in the table below for the amount of this component at each period).\nThe table below details Fee-earning AUM by its respective components at each period.\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Results </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of Fee-earning AUM </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM based on capital commitments (1) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>77,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>72,059 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70,032 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM based on invested capital (2) </td> <td>38,055 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,639 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,369 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM based on collateral balances, at par (3) </td> <td>26,480 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,887 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,921 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM based on net asset value (4) </td> <td>7,966 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,531 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,288 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM based on lower of cost or fair value and other (5) </td> <td>19,872 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,941 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,942 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, End of Period (6) (7) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>170,102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>161,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>159,552 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Reflects limited partner capital commitments where the original investment period, weighted-average investment period, or commitment fee period has not expired.\n(2)Reflects limited partner invested capital at cost and includes amounts committed to or reserved for investments for certain Global Private Equity and Investment Solutions funds.\n(3)Represents the amount of aggregate Fee-earning collateral balances and principal balances, at par, for our CLOs/structured products.\n(4)Reflects the net asset value of certain other carry funds.\n(5)Includes funds with fees based on gross asset value.\n(6)Energy III, Energy IV, and Renew II (collectively, the Legacy Energy Funds\u201d) are managed with Riverstone Holdings LLC and its affiliates. Affiliates of both Carlyle and Riverstone act as investment advisers to each of the Legacy Energy Funds. Carlyle has a minority representation on the management committees of Energy IV and Renew II. Carlyle and Riverstone each hold half of the seats on the management committees of Energy III, but the investment period for this fund has expired and the remaining investments in such fund are being disposed of in the ordinary course of business.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Legacy Energy Funds had, in the aggregate, approximately $0.8 billion in AUM and $1.2 billion in Fee-earning AUM. We are no longer raising capital for the Legacy Energy Funds and expect these balances to continue to decrease over time as the funds wind down.\n(7)Ending balance excludes $13.4 billion of pending Fee-earning AUM for which fees have not yet been activated.\nThe table below provides the period to period rollforward of Fee-earning AUM.\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Results </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM Rollforward </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, Beginning of Period </td> <td>$ </td> <td>161,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>159,552 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>124,595 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inflows (1) </td> <td>22,481 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,460 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,164 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outflows (including realizations) (2) </td> <td>(17,130) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15,293) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13,486) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Activity & Other (3) </td> <td>(466) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,115 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign Exchange (4) </td> <td>4,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(777) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,783) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, End of Period </td> <td>$ </td> <td>170,102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>161,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>159,552 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Inflows represents limited partner capital raised by our carry funds or separately managed accounts for which management fees based on commitments were activated during the period, the fee-earning commitments invested in vehicles for which management fees are based on invested capital, the fee-earning collateral balance of new CLO issuances, as well as gross subscriptions in our vehicles for which management fees are based on net asset value. Inflows exclude fundraising amounts during the period for which fees have not yet been activated, which are referenced as Pending Fee-earning AUM. Inflows also includes $4.1 billion of fee-earning Carlyle Aviation Partners (formerly Apollo Aviation Group) assets which were acquired in a transaction that closed in December 2018.\n(2)Outflows represents the impact of realizations from vehicles with management fees based on remaining invested capital at cost or fair value, changes in basis for funds where the investment period, weighted-average investment period or commitment fee period has expired during the period, reductions for funds that are no longer calling for fees, gross redemptions in our open-end funds, and runoff of CLO collateral balances. Distributions for funds earning management fees based on commitments during the period do not affect Fee-earning AUM.\n(3)Market Activity & Other represents realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments in our carry funds based on the lower of cost or fair value and net asset value, as well as activity of funds with fees based on gross asset value.\n(4)Foreign Exchange represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated funds. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the period end.\nRefer to - Segment Analysis\u201d for a detailed discussion by segment of the activity affecting Fee-earning AUM for each of the periods presented by segment.\nAssets under Management. Assets under management or AUM\u201d refers to the assets we manage or advise. Our AUM equals the sum of the following:\n(a) the aggregate fair value of our carry funds and related co-investment vehicles, NGP Predecessor Funds and separately managed accounts, plus the capital that Carlyle is entitled to call from investors in those funds and vehicles (including Carlyle commitments to those funds and vehicles and those of senior Carlyle professionals and employees) pursuant to the terms of their capital commitments to those funds and vehicles;\n(b) the amount of aggregate collateral balance and principal cash at par or aggregate principal amount of the notes of our CLOs and other structured products (inclusive of all positions);\n(c) the net asset value of certain carry funds; and\n(d) the gross assets (including assets acquired with leverage) of our business development companies, plus the capital that Carlyle is entitled to call from investors in those vehicles pursuant to the terms of their capital commitments to those vehicles.\nWe include in our calculation of AUM and Fee-earning AUM certain energy and renewable resources funds that we jointly advise with Riverstone Holdings L.L.C. ( Riverstone\u201d) and the NGP Energy Funds that are advised by NGP.\nFor most of our carry funds, total AUM includes the fair value of the capital invested, whereas Fee-earning AUM includes the amount of capital commitments or the remaining amount of invested capital, depending on whether the original investment period for the fund has expired. As such, Fee-earning AUM may be greater than total AUM when the aggregate fair value of the remaining investments is less than the cost of those investments.\nOur calculations of AUM and Fee-earning AUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers. As a result, these measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. In addition, our calculation of AUM (but not Fee-earning AUM) includes uncalled commitments to, and the fair value of invested capital in, our investment funds from Carlyle and our personnel, regardless of whether such commitments or invested capital are subject to management fees or performance allocations. Our calculations of AUM or Fee-earning AUM are not based on any definition of AUM or Fee-earning AUM that is set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds that we manage or advise.\nWe generally use Fee-earning AUM as a metric to measure changes in the assets from which we earn recurring management fees. Total AUM tends to be a better measure of our investment and fundraising performance as it reflects investments at fair value plus available capital.\nAvailable Capital. Available Capital refers to the amount of capital commitments available to be called for investments, which may be reduced for equity invested that is funded via a fund credit facility and expected to be called from investors at a later date, plus any additional assets/liabilities at the fund level other than active investments. Amounts previously called may be added back to available capital following certain distributions. Expired Available Capital\u201d occurs when a fund has passed the investment and follow-on periods and can no longer invest capital into new or existing deals. Any remaining Available Capital, typically a result of either recycled distributions or specific reserves established for the follow-on period that are not drawn, can only be called for fees and expenses and is therefore removed from the Total AUM calculation.\nThe table below provides the period to period rollforward of Total AUM.\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Results </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total AUM Rollforward </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, Beginning of Period </td> <td>$ </td> <td>224,442 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>216,470 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>195,061 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inflows (1) </td> <td>26,902 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,970 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,701 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outflows (including realizations) (2) </td> <td>(21,477) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20,187) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24,760) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Activity & Other (3) </td> <td>10,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,146 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,337 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign Exchange (4) </td> <td>5,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(957) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,869) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, End of Period </td> <td>$ </td> <td>245,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>224,442 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>216,470 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Inflows reflects the impact of gross fundraising during the period.

Inflows also includes $5.8 billion of Carlyle Aviation Partners (formerly Apollo Aviation Group) assets which were acquired in a transaction that closed in December 2018.\n(2)Outflows includes distributions net of recallable or recyclable amounts in our carry funds, related co-investment vehicles, separately managed accounts and the NGP Predecessor Funds, gross redemptions in our open-end funds, runoff of CLO collateral balances and the expiration of available capital.\n(3)Market Activity & Other generally represents realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments in our carry funds and related co-investment vehicles, the NGP Predecessor Funds and separately managed accounts, as well as the net impact of fees, expenses and non-investment income, change in gross asset value for our business development companies and other changes in AUM.\n(4)Foreign Exchange represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated funds. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the period end.\nPortfolio Appreciation (Depreciation). The overall portfolio appreciation of 10% in 2020 is comprised of 19% appreciation for carry funds within our Global Private Equity segment focusing on corporate private equity, 8% for funds focusing on real estate and (16)% for fund focusing on natural resources, (2)% appreciation for carry funds in the Global Credit segment and 10% for carry funds in the Investment Solutions segment. While there is no perfectly comparable market index benchmark for the overall portfolio or any of its segments or strategies, we would note that S&P 500 and MSCI ACWI appreciation for the year were 16% and 14%, respectively, while the FTSE NAREIT Composite appreciation was (10)%, the S&P Oil and Gas Exploration & Production Index was (38)%, and S&P Leveraged Loan Index appreciation was 3%.\nConsolidation of Certain Carlyle Funds\nThe Company consolidates all entities that it controls either through a majority voting interest or as the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities, which are collectively referred to as the Consolidated Funds in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2020, our Consolidated Funds represent approximately 2% of our AUM; 2% of our fund management fees; and less than 1% of our investment income for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nWe are not required under the consolidation guidance to consolidate in our financial statements most of the investment funds we advise. However, we consolidate certain CLOs that we advise. As of December 31, 2020, our consolidated CLOs held approximately $6.3 billion of total assets and comprised substantially all of the assets and loans payable of the Consolidated Funds. The assets and liabilities of the Consolidated Funds are generally held within separate legal entities and, as a result, the liabilities of the Consolidated Funds are non-recourse to us.\nGenerally, the consolidation of the Consolidated Funds has a gross-up effect on our assets, liabilities and cash flows but has no net effect on the net income attributable to the Company and equity. The majority of the net economic ownership interests of the Consolidated Funds are reflected as non-controlling interests in consolidated entities in the consolidated financial statements. Because only a small portion of our funds are consolidated, the performance of the Consolidated Funds is not necessarily consistent with or representative of the combined performance trends of all of our funds.\nFor further information on our consolidation policy and the consolidation of certain funds, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table and discussion sets forth information regarding our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on substantially the same basis for all historical periods presented; however, the consolidated funds are not the same entities in all periods shown due to changes in U.S. GAAP, changes in fund terms and the creation and termination of funds. As further described above, the consolidation of these funds primarily had the impact of increasing interest and other income of Consolidated Funds, interest and other expenses of Consolidated Funds, and net investment gains of Consolidated Funds in the year that the fund is initially consolidated. The consolidation of these funds had no effect on net income attributable to the Company for the periods presented.\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

These amounts were inclusive of unrealized gains (losses) resulting from changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives related to certain reinsurance contracts included in Fortitude Re's U.S. GAAP financial statements. Modified coinsurance is subject to the general accounting principles for hedging, specifically the guidance originally issued as Derivatives Implementation Group Issue No. B36: Embedded Derivatives: Modified Coinsurance Agreements and Debt Instruments That Incorporate Credit Risk Exposures That Are Unrelated or Only Partially Related to the Creditworthiness of the Obligor under Those Instruments ( DIG B36\u201d). As of December 31, 2019, our investment in Fortitude Holdings was $1,200.9 million, which reflected $628.2 million of cumulative unrealized gains related to the change in the fair value of embedded derivatives.\nAt the time we contributed our existing 19.9% interest in Fortitude Holdings to Carlyle FRL, a Carlyle-affiliated investment fund, we began accounting for our investment under the equity method based on our net asset value in the fund. Our investment in Carlyle FRL, which is an investment company, reflects our investment in Fortitude Holdings at fair value. Although the fair value reflected a 10% appreciation over our cost, this resulted in a loss in principal investment income (loss) of $620.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, our investment in Carlyle FRL was $554.4 million, relative to our cost of $465.4 million.\nOur investment in NGP entitles us to 55% of the management fee-related revenue of the NGP entities that serve as advisors to the NGP Energy Funds and is subject to impairment under the U.S. GAAP accounting for equity method investments. We evaluate our equity method investment in NGP for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable, but no less than quarterly. For example, challenges with fundraising or lower future management fees could cause an impairment of our investment in NGP in the future. As of December 31, 2020, we continue to believe that our investment in NGP is not impaired.\nPerformance Allocations. Performance allocations increased $836.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 and increased $176.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018.

As a result, amounts presented may not include the impact of economic activity in the current quarter.\nRefer to - Key Financial Measures\u201d for a listing of the funds with performance allocations in excess of 10% of the total for the periods presented.\nGlobal equity markets remained strong in 2020, driven by the sharp decline in interest rates, significant increases in fiscal support, and the sense among market participants that the COVID-19 pandemic reflects a temporary decline in the supply of certain experiences and services rather than an endogenous drop in consumer demand. Our carry fund portfolio generally exhibited similar resiliency amidst the significant economic and market disruptions in 2020, with particular momentum in the latter half of the year. Within our Global Private Equity segment, our corporate private equity funds appreciated by 11% in the fourth quarter and 19% over the last twelve months and our real estate funds appreciated by 3% during the fourth quarter and appreciated 8% over the last twelve months. Our natural resources funds appreciated by 3% during the fourth quarter, but depreciated by 16% over the last twelve months, as our energy funds continue to recover from extreme volatility in the early stages of the pandemic. Global Credit carry funds, which represent approximately 14% of the total Global Credit remaining fair value, were up 7% in the fourth quarter, with depreciation of 2% for the year. Investment Solutions appreciation was 7% in the fourth quarter and 10% for the year, driven by strong investment performance in our AlpInvest funds, though the valuations of our primary and secondary funds of funds generally reflect investment values on a one-quarter lag. Though significant risks remain for global markets and economic recovery into 2021, we believe our existing portfolio of assets is high-quality and well-diversified by fund, industry sector, asset class, and region.\nIn addition, we recorded incentive fees from Consolidated Funds of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. These fees eliminated upon consolidation. There were no incentive fees from Consolidated Funds recorded during the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019.\nInterest and Other Income. Interest and other income decreased $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 and decreased $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily as a result of decreases from the reimbursement of certain costs incurred on behalf of Carlyle funds and decreases in interest income from investments in CLO subordinated notes and interest income related to corporate treasury investments that matured in 2019. The decrease in 2019 reflected a decrease in interest income related to corporate treasury investments, partially offset by the reimbursement of certain costs incurred on behalf of Carlyle funds.\nInterest and Other Income of Consolidated Funds. Our CLOs generate interest income primarily from investments in bonds and loans inclusive of amortization of discounts and generate other income from consent and amendment fees. Substantially all interest and other income of the CLOs and other consolidated funds together with interest expense of our CLOs and net investment gains of Consolidated Funds is attributable to the related funds' limited partners or CLO investors. Accordingly, such amounts have no material impact on net income attributable to the Company.\nInterest and other income of consolidated funds increased $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, and decreased $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. Substantially all of the variance in interest and other income of Consolidated Funds for both periods relates to interest income from CLOs.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses increased $213.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, and increased $48.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. The following table provides the components of the changes in total expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Expenses, prior year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,119.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,071.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increases (Decreases): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in total compensation and benefits </td> <td>323.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Decrease) increase in general, administrative and other expenses </td> <td>(145.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in interest </td> <td>11.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in interest and other expenses of Consolidated Funds </td> <td>31.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(32.8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Decrease) increase in other non-operating expense </td> <td>(8.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total increase </td> <td>213.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Expenses, current year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,333.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,119.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal Compensation and Benefits. Total compensation and benefits increased $323.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, and increased $47.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, due to the following:\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in cash-based compensation and benefits </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>86.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in equity-based compensation </td> <td>(35.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(99.9) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in performance allocations and incentive fee related compensation </td> <td>342.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total increase in total compensation and benefits </td> <td>$ </td> <td>323.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash-based compensation and benefits. Cash-based compensation and benefits increased $16.2 million, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, and increased $86.7 million, or 14%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to the following:\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in headcount and bonuses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Decrease) increase in compensation expense associated with contingent earn-out payments (1)\n</td> <td>(11.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total increase in base compensation and benefits </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>86.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The Carlyle Aviation Partners acquisition included an earn-out of up to $150.0 million. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional detail.\nEquity-based compensation. Equity-based compensation decreased $35.0 million, or 25%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019. The decrease in equity-based compensation from 2019 to 2020 was due primarily to the lower rate of ongoing grants of restricted stock units, as well as a forfeiture credit recorded in 2020 related to the retirement of one of our co-chief executive officers.\nEquity-based compensation decreased $99.9 million, or 42%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. The decrease in equity-based compensation from 2018 to 2019 was due primarily to the timing of the last vesting of awards in May 2018 related to our initial public offering in 2012 and lower rate of ongoing grants of restricted stock units.\nPerformance allocations and incentive fee related compensation expense. Performance allocations and incentive fee related compensation expense increased $342.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 and increased $60.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. Performance allocations and incentive fee related compensation expense as a percentage of performance allocations and incentive fee was 47%, 52%, and 58% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Performance allocations and incentive fee related compensation as a percentage of performance allocations and incentive fees fluctuates depending on the mix of funds contributing to performance allocations and incentive fees in a given period. For our largest segment, Global Private Equity, our performance allocations and incentive fee related compensation expense as a percentage of performance allocations is generally around 45%. Performance allocations from our Investment Solutions segment pay a higher ratio of performance allocations as compensation, primarily as a result of the terms of our acquisition of AlpInvest. Conversely, performance allocations from the Legacy Energy and NGP funds in our Global Private Equity segment are primarily allocated to Carlyle because the investment teams for the Legacy Energy and NGP funds are employed by Riverstone and NGP, respectively, and not Carlyle.\nGeneral, Administrative and Other Expenses. General, administrative and other expenses decreased $145.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, and increased $33.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to:\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in net insurance proceeds recognized for certain legal matters </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease assignment and termination costs </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(66.9) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CCC litigation cost recovery(1)\n</td> <td>(29.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Lower) higher intangible asset amortization </td> <td>(0.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Lower) higher depreciation and amortization </td> <td>(12.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Lower) higher professional fees, including corporate conversion costs </td> <td>(29.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Lower) higher travel and conference costs </td> <td>(49.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange adjustments(2)\n</td> <td>(29.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Higher (lower) external fundraising costs </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34.3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other changes </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (decrease) increase in general, administrative and other expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(145.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.\n(2) For the years ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 and December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, foreign exchange adjustments are primarily driven by the revaluation in our European CLOs investments.\nInterest. Interest increased $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to interest accrued on the 3.500% Senior Notes issued in September 2019. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nInterest and Other Expenses of Consolidated Funds. Interest and other expenses of Consolidated Funds increased $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to higher interest expense on the consolidated CLOs. Interest and other expenses of Consolidated Funds decreased $32.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to lower interest expense on the consolidated CLOs.\nThe CLOs incur interest expense on their loans payable and incur other expenses consisting of trustee fees, rating agency fees and professional fees. Substantially all interest and other income of our CLOs together with interest expense of our CLOs and net investment gains of Consolidated Funds is attributable to the related funds' limited partners or CLO investors. Accordingly, such amounts have no material impact on net income attributable to the Company.\nOther Non-operating Expenses (Income). For the year ended December 31, 2020, this caption includes the impact of the Conversion on our tax receivable agreement liability, which was reduced by $9.3 million. See Note 11 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements for more information on the tax impacts of the Conversion. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, this caption also represents the change in the fair value of contingent consideration associated with the Company's acquisitions.\nNet Investment Gains (Losses) of Consolidated Funds\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 net investment (losses) gains of Consolidated Funds was $(21.3) million, $(23.9) million, and $4.5 million, respectively, comprised of the activity of the consolidated CLOs and certain other funds. For the consolidated CLOs, the amount reflects the net gain or loss on the fair value adjustment of both the assets and liabilities. The components of net investment gains of consolidated funds for the respective periods are:\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized losses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(91.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4.9) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in unrealized gains (losses) </td> <td>62.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(103.9) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total losses </td> <td>(29.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(108.8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains (losses) from liabilities of CLOs </td> <td>7.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>113.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net investment (losses) gains of Consolidated Funds </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(23.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated entities was $34.6 million, $36.6 million, and $33.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These amounts are primarily attributable to the net earnings of the Consolidated Funds for each period, which are substantially all allocated to the related funds' limited partners or CLO investors. The net income (loss) of our Consolidated Funds, after eliminations, was $8.1 million, $10.0 million, and $(5.3) million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated entities also includes net income attributable to non-controlling interests in carried interest, giveback obligations, and cash held for carried interest distributions.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to The Carlyle Group Inc. Common Stockholders\nThe net income attributable to The Carlyle Group Inc. common stockholders was $348.2 million, $345.3 million, and $92.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Prior to the Conversion, the Company was allocated a portion of the monthly net income (loss) attributable to Carlyle Holdings based on the Company's ownership in Carlyle Holdings (which was approximately 34% and 32% as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively). Net income or loss attributable to the Company also included 100% of the net income or loss attributable to the Company's wholly owned taxable subsidiary, Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc., which was $(4.5) million and $15.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As a result, prior to the Conversion, the total net income or loss attributable to the Company has varied as a percentage of the net income or loss attributable to Carlyle Holdings. In addition, net income attributable to The Carlyle Group L.P. common unitholders for the year ended December 31, 2019 was reduced by the Series A preferred units ( Preferred Units\u201d) redemption premium. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded approximately $86 million as a provision for income taxes as a result of a reduction in our net deferred tax asset related to the Conversion. Excluding this impact from Conversion, our effective income tax rate would have been approximately 19%.\nNet income attributable to The Carlyle Group Inc. common stockholders per basic common share was $0.99, $3.05, and $0.89 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net income (loss) attributable to The Carlyle Group Inc. common unitholders per diluted common share was $0.97, $2.82, and $0.82 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following tables set forth information in the format used by management when making resource deployment decisions and in assessing performance of our segments. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Our Non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effects of unrealized performance allocations net of related compensation expense, unrealized principal investment income, consolidated funds, acquisition-related items including amortization and any impairment charges of acquired intangible assets and contingent consideration taking the form of earn-outs, charges associated with equity-based compensation, changes in the tax receivable agreement liability, corporate actions and infrequently occurring or unusual events.\nThe following table shows our total segment Distributable

Our segment information is reflected in the manner used by our senior management to make operating and compensation decisions, assess performance and allocate resources.\nHistorically, we have conducted our operations through four reportable segments: Corporate Private Equity, Real Assets, Global Credit, and Investment Solutions. In the fourth quarter of 2020, in connection with our transition to a sole chief executive officer on October 1, 2020, our senior management began re-evaluating our operating structure. As a result, we revised our operating segments by combining Corporate Private Equity and Real Assets into a single segment called Global Private Equity to reflect how senior management manages and assesses the performance of the business and allocates resources. Effective with the three months ended December 31, 2020, we have modified the presentation of our segment financial information to reflect this change, with retrospective application to all prior periods presented. Consequently, information for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 will be different from the historical segment financial results we previously reported in our reports filed with the SEC. There was no impact to the Global Credit and Investment Solutions segments as a result of this change.\nFor segment reporting purposes, revenues and expenses are presented on a basis that deconsolidates our Consolidated Funds. As a result, segment revenues from management fees, realized performance revenues and realized principal investment income (loss) are different than those presented on a consolidated U.S. GAAP basis because these revenues recognized in certain segments are received from Consolidated Funds and are eliminated in consolidation when presented on a consolidated U.S. GAAP basis. Furthermore, segment expenses are different than related amounts presented on a consolidated U.S. GAAP basis due to the exclusion of fund expenses that are paid by the Consolidated Funds.\nGlobal Private Equity\nFor purposes of presenting our results of operations for this segment, our earnings from our investments in NGP are presented in the respective operating captions.

Realized net performance revenues increased $64.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, and decreased $147.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. Realized net performance revenues increased in 2020 as we began realizing carry from CP VI during the year, and we generated higher performance revenue realizations from our financial services and Europe real estate funds. Realized net performance revenues in 2019 were also impacted by the realized clawback on one of the Legacy Energy funds.\nThe decrease in realized net performance revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to to lower performance revenue realizations from our U.S., Europe and Asia buyout funds in carry, as well as $19.0 million of realized clawback on Riverstone Legacy Energy Fund IV in 2019, partially offset by higher realizations on our U.S. real estate funds.\nRealized net performance revenues were primarily generated by the following funds for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively:\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CP IV </td> <td> </td> <td>CETP III </td> <td> </td> <td>CP V </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CP V </td> <td> </td> <td>CAP III </td> <td> </td> <td>CEP III </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CP VI </td> <td> </td> <td>CGFSP II </td> <td> </td> <td>CAP III </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CETP III </td> <td> </td> <td>CETP II </td> <td> </td> <td>CETP III </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CGFSP I </td> <td> </td> <td>CP V </td> <td> </td> <td>CRP VII </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CRP VII </td> <td> </td> <td>CPI </td> <td> </td> <td>CRP III </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CERF </td> <td> </td> <td>Energy IV (clawback) </td> <td> </td> <td>CRP VI </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CEREP III </td> <td> </td> <td>CRP III </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CPI </td> <td> </td> <td>CRP VI </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CGFSP II </td> <td> </td> <td>CRP VII </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CRP III </td> <td> </td> <td>CRP V </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CCI </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRealized Principal Investment Income. Realized principal investment income decreased $21.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 and increased $33.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared\nto 2018. The decrease in realized principal investment income for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to the recovery of $71.5 million from the final resolution of French tax litigation concerning a European real estate fund in 2019, partially offset by higher realized gains in 2020 from CP VI, CEP IV and CAP IV.\nThe increase in realized principal investment income for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily relates to the aforementioned $71.5 million French tax matter recovery, which reversed a portion of an investment loss recognized in 2015 (see Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements for more information on this matter), partially offset by realized losses in 2019 from CP VI and CEP IV compared to realized gains in 2018 from CP VI, CEP III and CAP IV.\nFee Related Earnings\nFee related earnings decreased $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, and increased $143.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018.

Total fee revenues decreased $80.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 and increased $136.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, due to the following:\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Lower) higher fund management fees </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(64.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>154.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lower portfolio advisory and transaction fees, net and other </td> <td>(16.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (decrease) increase in fee revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(80.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>136.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in fund management fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to lower management fees from CGIOF, including $20.4 million in catch-up management fees for subsequent closes in 2019, and lower management fees from NGP X, NGP XI and NGP XII. These decreases were partially offset by higher management fees from CIEP II, including catch-up management fees of $6.6 million in 2020, activation of management fees in 2020 on our fourth Japan buyout fund ( CJP IV\u201d), and higher management fees from CETP IV.\nThe increase in fund management fees for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to the activation of management fees during 2018 on our seventh U.S. buyout fund ( CP VII\u201d), our fifth Asia buyout fund ( CAP V\u201d) and our fifth Europe buyout fund ( CEP V\u201d), and on our fourth Europe technology fund ( CETP IV\u201d) during the third quarter of 2019. We also had increased management fees from CGIOF, CIEP II, CPI and NGP XII, partially offset by lower management fees from CRP VII, CIEP I, CEREP III and CRP V. Management fees also increased as a result of $26.4 million in catch-up management fees for subsequent closes in 2019 for CGIOF and NGP XII. These increases were partially offset by lower fee rates and a lower basis for CP VI, CAP IV, CEP IV, and CETP III as they exited the investment period.\nThe weighted average management fee rate decreased slightly from 1.26% at December 31, 2019 to 1.25% at December 31, 2020. Fee-earning AUM was $91.6 billion and $94.8 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, reflecting a decrease of $3.2 billion.\nThe weighted average management fee rate increased from 1.23% at December 31, 2018 to 1.26% at December 31, 2019. The increase in the weighted average management fee rate was driven by additional fundraising and fee activation in funds with higher effective fee rates than the segment weighted average. Fee-earning AUM was $94.8 billion and $95.3 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, reflecting a decrease of $0.5 billion\nThe decrease in transaction fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 resulted primarily from transaction fees related to investments in CP VII, CIEP and CJP III in 2019, partially offset by transaction fees related to investments in CGFSP II, CGFSP III and CIEP II in 2020. The decrease in transaction fees for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 resulted primarily from transaction fees related to significant investments in CP VII and one significant investment in CAP IV in 2018, partially offset by transaction fees in CIEP and CJP III in 2019.\nCash-based compensation and benefits expense. Cash-based compensation and benefits expense decreased $8.7 million, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to lower cash bonuses as a result of decreased headcount. Cash-based compensation and benefits expense increased $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to higher cash bonuses in 2019.\nGeneral, administrative and other indirect expenses. General, administrative and other indirect expenses decreased $57.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to the allocated portion of the cost recovery associated with the CCC matter of $20.3 million (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more information), lower professional fees and lower travel and entertainment expenses as a result of travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. General, administrative and other indirect expenses decreased $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to lower external costs associated with fundraising activities.\nFee-earning AUM as of and for each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2020\nFee-earning AUM is presented below for each period together with the components of change during each respective period.\nThe table below breaks out Fee-earning AUM by its respective components at each period.\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global Private Equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of Fee-earning AUM (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM based on capital commitments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,902 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51,274 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM based on invested capital </td> <td>30,129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,012 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,827 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM based on net asset value </td> <td>3,208 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,308 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,479 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM based on lower of cost or fair value and other </td> <td>2,297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,755 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Fee-earning AUM </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91,571 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94,811 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95,335 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted Average Management Fee Rates (2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All Funds </td> <td>1.25 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.26 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.22 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds in Investment Period </td> <td>1.37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.41 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.41 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)For additional information concerning the components of Fee-earning AUM, see -Fee-earning Assets under Management.\u201d\n(2)Represents the aggregate effective management fee rate of each fund in the segment, weighted by each fund's Fee-earning AUM, as of the end of each period presented.\nThe table below provides the period to period rollforward of Fee-earning AUM.\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global Private Equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM Rollforward </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, Beginning of Period </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94,811 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,183 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inflows (1) </td> <td>5,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,315 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,893 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outflows (including realizations) (2) </td> <td>(9,514) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,591) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,223) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Activity & Other (3) </td> <td>(306) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(117) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign Exchange (4) </td> <td>1,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(239) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(401) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, End of Period </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91,571 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94,811 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95,335 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Inflows represents limited partner capital raised by our carry funds or separately managed accounts for which management fees based on commitments were activated during the period, the fee-earning commitments invested in vehicles for which management fees are based on invested capital, and gross subscriptions in open-ended vehicles with management fees based on net asset value. Inflows exclude fundraising amounts during the period for which fees have not yet been activated, which are referenced as Pending Fee-earning AUM.\n(2)Outflows represents the impact of realizations from vehicles with management fees based on remaining invested capital at cost or fair value, changes in basis for funds where the investment period, weighted-average investment period or commitment fee period has expired during the period, reductions for funds that are no longer calling for fees, and gross redemptions in open-ended vehicles with management fees based on net asset value.

Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the period end.\nFee-earning AUM was $91.6 billion at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $3.2 billion, or 3%, compared to $94.8 billion at December 31, 2019. This was driven by outflows of $9.5 billion which were principally a result of dispositions in our U.S. Buyout, NGP Energy, and Legacy Energy funds, as well as distributions in other funds outside of their investment period. Partially offsetting this were inflows of $5.4 billion primarily related to the activation of management fees in CJP IV, subscriptions in CPI, and new fee-paying commitments raised in various other funds. Also offsetting the decrease was positive foreign exchange activity of $1.2 billion from the translation of our Europe buyout, growth, and real estate AUM from EUR to USD. Investment and distribution activity by funds still in the investment period does not impact Fee-earning AUM as these funds are based on commitments.\nFee-earning AUM was $94.8 billion at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $0.5 billion, or 1%, compared to $$95.3 billion at December 31, 2018. This was driven by outflows of $8.6 billion which were principally a result of dispositions in our U.S. Buyout, U.S. Real Estate, NGP Energy, and Europe Buyout funds, as well as distributions in other funds outside of their investment period. This was offset by inflows of $8.3 billion primarily related to the activation of management fees in CIEP II and CETP IV, as well as new fee-paying commitments raised in various other funds.\nFee-earning AUM was $95.3 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $28.2 billion, or 42%, compared to $67.2 billion at December 31, 2017. This was driven by inflows of $35.9 billion principally from the activation of management fees in CP VII, CEP V, and CAP V. This was partially offset by outflows of $7.2 billion which were principally the result of fee basis stepdowns in CP VI, CEP IV and CAP IV, as well as distributions in other funds outside of their investment period.\nTotal AUM as of and for each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2020\nThe table below provides the period to period rollforward of Total AUM.\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global Private Equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total AUM Rollforward </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, Beginning of Period </td> <td>$ </td> <td>129,784 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126,399 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>115,446 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inflows (1) </td> <td>3,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,663 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,576 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outflows (including realizations) (2) </td> <td>(9,589) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,904) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,132) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Activity & Other (3) </td> <td>6,412 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,948 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,338 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign Exchange (4) </td> <td>1,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(322) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(829) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, End of Period </td> <td>$ </td> <td>131,780 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>129,784 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126,399 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Inflows reflects the impact of gross fundraising during the period.

This increase was driven by $3.6 billion of inflows primarily due to fundraising in CPI, CIEP II, and CJP IV. Also contributing to this increase was market appreciation of $6.4 billion. The carry funds driving appreciation for the period included $6.1 billion attributable to CP VI, $1.3 billion attributable to CAP IV, and $0.8 billion attributable to CP VII, offset by $(1.0) billion attributable to NGP XI and $(0.5) billion attributable to CIEP. The increase of $1.6 billion in foreign exchange activity was primarily from the translation of our Europe buyout, growth, and real estate AUM from EUR to USD. Partially offsetting the increase were $9.6 billion of outflows driven primarily by distributions in our U.S. Buyout, Asia Buyout and U.S. Real Estate funds.\nTotal AUM was $129.8 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $3.4 billion, or 3%, compared to $126.4 billion at December 31, 2018. This increase was driven by $10.7 billion of inflows primarily due to fundraising in CJP IV, CGP II, CETP IV, and CIEP II. Also contributing to this increase was market appreciation and other activity of $2.9 billion due to appreciation in our carry funds partially offset by the impact of management fees and expenses. The carry funds driving appreciation for the period included $0.9 billion attributable to CP VI, $0.5 billion attributable to CP VII, and $0.4 billion attributable to CAP V. Partially offsetting the increase were $9.9 billion of outflows driven primarily by distributions in our U.S. Real Estate, NGP Energy, and U.S. Buyout funds.\nTotal AUM was $126.4 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $11.0 billion, or 9%, compared to $115.4 billion at December 31, 2017. This increase was driven by $22.6 billion of inflows primarily due to fundraising in CEP IV, CP VII, and CAP V. Also contributing to this increase was market appreciation and other activity of $3.3 billion. The carry funds driving appreciation for the period included $1.0 billion attributable to CP VI, $0.5 billion attributable to CEP IV, and $0.4 billion attributable to CP V. Partially offsetting this increase were $14.1 billion of outflows driven primarily by distributions in our U.S. Buyout, Asia Buyout and U.S. Real Estate funds.\nFund Performance Metrics\nFund performance information for our investment funds that generally have at least $1.0 billion in capital commitments, cumulative equity invested or total value as of December 31, 2020, which we refer to as our significant funds,\u201d\nis included throughout this discussion and analysis to facilitate an understanding of our results of operations for the periods presented.

Represents remaining fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried interest, and may include remaining escrow values for realized investments.\n(4) Multiple of invested capital ( MOIC\u201d) represents total fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried interest, divided by cumulative invested capital.\n(5) An investment is considered realized when the investment fund has completely exited, and ceases to own an interest in, the investment. An investment is considered partially realized when the total amount of proceeds received in respect of such investment, including dividends, interest or other distributions and/or return of capital, represents at least 85% of invested capital and such investment is not yet fully realized. Because part of our value creation strategy involves pursuing best exit alternatives, we believe information regarding Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and Gross IRR, when considered together with the other investment performance metrics presented, provides investors with meaningful information regarding our investment performance by removing the impact of investments where significant realization activity has not yet occurred. Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and Gross IRR have limitations as measures of investment performance, and should not be considered in isolation. Such limitations include the fact that these measures do not include the performance of earlier stage and other investments that do not satisfy the criteria provided above. The exclusion of such investments will have a positive impact on Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and Gross IRR in instances when the MOIC and Gross IRR in respect of such investments are less than the aggregate MOIC and Gross IRR. Our measurements of Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and Gross IRR may not be comparable to those of other companies that use similarly titled measures.\n(6) Gross Internal Rate of Return ( Gross IRR\u201d) represents an annualized time-weighted return on Limited Partner invested capital, based on contributions, distributions and unrealized fair value as of the reporting date, before the impact of management fees, partnership expenses and carried interest. For fund vintages 2017 and after, Gross IRR includes the impact of interest expense related to the funding of investments on fund lines of credit. Gross IRR is calculated based on the timing of Limited Partner cash flows, which may differ to varying degrees from the timing of actual investment cash flows for the fund. Subtotal Gross IRR aggregations for multiple funds are calculated based on actual cash flow dates for each fund and represent a theoretical time-weighted return for a Limited Partner who invested sequentially in each fund.\n(7) Net Internal Rate of Return ( Net IRR\u201d) represents an annualized time-weighted return on Limited Partner invested capital, based on contributions, distributions and unrealized fair value as of the reporting date, after the impact of all management fees, partnership expenses and carried interest, including current accruals. Net IRR is calculated based on the timing of Limited Partner cash flows, which may differ to varying degrees from the timing of actual investment cash flows for the fund. Fund level IRRs are based on aggregate Limited Partner cash flows, and this blended return may differ from that of individual Limited Partners. As a result, certain funds may generate accrued performance revenues with a blended Net IRR that is below the preferred return hurdle for that fund. Subtotal Net IRR aggregations for multiple funds are calculated based on actual cash flow dates for each fund and represent a theoretical time-weighted return for a Limited Partner who invested sequentially in each fund.\n(8) Represents the net accrued performance fee balance/(giveback obligation) as of the current quarter end.\n(9) Represents all realized proceeds combined with remaining fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried interest.\n(10) Aggregate includes the following funds, as well as all active co-investments, separately managed accounts (SMA's), and stand-alone investments arranged by us: CVP II, MENA, CCI, CSSAF I, CSABF, CPF, CAP Growth I, and CBPF II.\n(11) Aggregate includes the following funds, as well as related co-investments, separately managed accounts (SMA's), and certain other stand-alone investments arranged by us: CP I, CP II, CP III, CP IV, CEP I, CAP I, CAP II, CBPF I, CJP I, CMG, CVP I, CUSGF III, CGFSP I, CEVP I, CETP I, CETP II, CAVP I, CAVP II, CAGP III and Mexico.\n(12) For funds marked NM,\u201d IRR may be positive or negative, but is not considered meaningful because of the limited time since initial investment and early stage of capital deployment. For funds marked Neg,\u201d IRR is considered meaningful but is negative as of reporting period end.\n(13) For purposes of aggregation, funds that report in foreign currency have been converted to U.S. dollars at the reporting period spot rate.\n(14) Aggregate includes the following funds, as well as all active co-investments, separately managed accounts (SMA's), and stand-alone investments

Realized net performance revenues increased $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily driven by Carlyle Aviation Partners in 2020. Realized net performance revenues decreased $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. The majority of realized net performance revenues was generated by our distressed debt carry funds and our business development companies in 2018.\nRealized Principal Investment Income. Realized principal investment income increased $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 and increased $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. The increase in realized principal investment income for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to realized losses in one of our energy mezzanine funds in 2019 and higher realized gains on investments in our business development companies. The increase in realized principal investment income for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to higher dividends from our Interval Fund in 2019.\nFee Related Earnings\nFee related earnings increased $51.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, and decreased $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018.

Total fee revenues increased $36.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 and increased $72.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, due to the following:\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Higher fund management fees </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Higher portfolio advisory and transaction fees, net and other </td> <td>19.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total increase in fee revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>72.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in fund management fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily driven by increased management fees from our structured credit funds, opportunistic credit carry fund, direct lending platform, Carlyle FRL and Carlyle Aviation Partners, partially offset by lower management fees from our energy mezzanine carry funds.\nThe increase in fund management fees for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily driven by management fees from Carlyle Aviation Partners, which was acquired in December 2018, management fees from CLOs that originated in 2018 and 2019, as well as increased management fees from our direct lending platform.\nThe weighted average management fee rate on our carry funds increased from 1.20% at December 31, 2019 to 1.22% at December 31, 2020 primarily due to fundraising in Carlyle Aviation Partners.\nThe weighted average management fee rate on our carry funds decreased from 1.23% at December 31, 2018 to 1.20% at December 31, 2019 primarily due to the step-down of the fee rate and basis in CEMOF II.\nThe increase in portfolio advisory and transaction fees, net, and other fees for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 as compared to the respective periods resulted primarily from transaction fees associated with Carlyle FRL in 2020 (see Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for more information) and increased underwriting fees related to Carlyle Global Capital Markets.\nThe increase in portfolio advisory and transaction fees, net, and other fees for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 as compared to the respective periods resulted primarily from increased underwriting fees related to Carlyle Global Capital Markets.\nCash-based compensation and benefits expense. Cash-based compensation and benefits expense increased $20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to increased headcount and higher cash bonuses. Cash-based compensation and benefits expense increased $44.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to the Carlyle Aviation Partners acquisition, as well as increased headcount and higher cash bonuses.\nGeneral, administrative and other indirect expenses. General, administrative and other indirect expenses decreased $33.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due the allocated portion of the cost recovery associated with the CCC matter of $6.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020 (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more information), as well as lower professional fees, due in part to expense recoveries from Carlyle FRL, and lower travel and entertainment expenses as a result of travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGeneral, administrative and other indirect expenses increased $48.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to $31.5 million of insurance proceeds related to commodities received in 2018 as well as increases related to our acquisition of Carlyle Aviation Partners in December 2018.\nFee-earning AUM as of and for each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2020\nFee-earning AUM is presented below for each period together with the components of change during each respective period.\nThe table below breaks out Fee-earning AUM by its respective components at each period.\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global Credit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of Fee-earning AUM (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM based on capital commitments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,921 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,727 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,403 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM based on invested capital </td> <td>5,607 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,509 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,885 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM based on collateral balances, at par </td> <td>26,480 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,887 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,921 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM based on net asset value </td> <td>1,578 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,561 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>867 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM based on other (2) </td> <td>4,547 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,076 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Fee-earning AUM </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,133 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,862 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,152 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted Average Management Fee Rates (3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All Funds, excluding CLOs </td> <td>1.22 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.20 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.23 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)For additional information concerning the components of Fee-earning AUM, see -Fee-earning Assets under Management.\u201d\n(2)Includes funds with fees based on gross asset value.\n(3)Represents the aggregate effective management fee rate for carry funds, weighted by each fund's Fee-earning AUM, as of the end of each period presented.

Inflows exclude fundraising amounts during the period for which fees have not yet been activated, which are referenced as Pending Fee-earning AUM. This also includes $4.1 billion of fee-earning Carlyle Aviation Partners (formerly Apollo Aviation Group) assets which were acquired in a transaction that closed in December 2018.\n(2)Outflows represents the impact of realizations from vehicles with management fees based on remaining invested capital at cost or fair value, changes in basis for funds where the investment period, weighted-average investment period or commitment fee period has expired during the period, reductions for funds that are no longer calling for fees, gross redemptions in our open-end funds, and runoff of CLO collateral balances. Realizations for funds earning management fees based on commitments during the period do not affect Fee-earning AUM.\n(3)Market Activity & Other represents realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments in funds or vehicles based on the lower of cost or fair value or net asset value, as well as activity of funds with fees based on gross asset value.\n(4)Foreign Exchange represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated funds. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the period end.\nFee-earning AUM was $42.1 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $4.2 billion, or 11%, compared to $37.9 billion at December 31, 2019. Driving the increase were inflows of $6.4 billion primarily attributable to new fee-paying capital raised in our U.S. and Europe CLOs, fee-paying third-party capital raised in our insurance business, and investment activity in CCOF, as well as $1.2 billion in foreign exchange activity related to the translation of our EUR-denominated CLOs to USD. Partially offsetting the increase were $3.9 billion of outflows primarily related to a fee basis step-down in CEMOF II and runoff of our CLO collateral balances. Distributions from carry funds still in the investment period do not impact Fee-earning AUM as these funds are based on commitments and not invested capital.\nFee-earning AUM was $37.9 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $2.7 billion, or 8%, compared to $35.2 billion at December 31, 2018. Driving the increase were inflows of $4.4 billion primarily attributable to new fee-paying capital raised in our U.S. and Europe CLO's and follow-on closes in CCOF, as well as $1.1 billion of market and other activity primarily related to increases in gross asset value in our BDCs and securitization vehicles. Partially offsetting the increase were $2.7 billion of outflows primarily related to a fee basis step-down in CEMOF II and runoff of our CLO collateral balances.\nFee-earning AUM was $35.2 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $7.9 billion, or 29%, compared to $27.3 billion at December 31, 2017. Driving the increase were inflows of $9.2 billion primarily attributable to the acquisition of Carlyle Aviation Partners and new fee-paying capital raised in our U.S. and Europe CLO's. Partially offsetting the increase were $1.2 billion of outflows primarily related to runoff of our CLO collateral balances as well as distributions from carry funds outside the investment period.\nTotal AUM as of and for each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2020\nThe table below provides the period to period rollforward of Total AUM.\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global Credit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total AUM Rollforward </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, Beginning of Period </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,412 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,417 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,324 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inflows (1) </td> <td>9,497 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,338 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,062 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outflows (including realizations) (2) </td> <td>(4,167) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,396) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,148) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Activity & Other (3) </td> <td>402 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>511 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign Exchange (4) </td> <td>737 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(137) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(332) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, End of Period </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,881 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,412 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,417 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Inflows reflects the impact of gross fundraising during the period. For funds or vehicles denominated in foreign currencies, this reflects translation at the average quarterly rate, while the separately reported Fundraising metric is translated at the spot rate for each individual closing. Inflows also includes $5.8 billion of Carlyle Aviation Partners (formerly Apollo Aviation Group) assets which were acquired in a transaction that closed in December 2018.\n(2)Outflows includes distributions net of recallable or recyclable amounts in our carry funds, related co-investment vehicles, and separately managed accounts, gross redemptions in our open-end funds, runoff of CLO collateral balances, and the expiration of available capital.\n(3)Market Activity & Other generally represents realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments in our carry funds, related co-investment vehicles, and separately managed accounts, as well as the impact of fees, expenses and non-investment income, change in gross asset value for our business development companies and other changes in AUM.\n(4)Foreign Exchange represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated funds. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the period end.\nTotal AUM was $55.9 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $6.5 billion, or 13%, compared to $49.4 billion at December 31, 2019. This was driven by $9.5 billion of inflows primarily due to new U.S. and Europe CLO issuances, fundraising in CCOF II, and closings in various platform accounts. Also driving the increase was $0.7 billion in foreign exchange activity related to the translation of our EUR-denominated CLOs to USD. Partially offsetting the increase were outflows of $4.2 billion primarily related to distributions in our Energy Credit and Aviation funds, as well as CLO run-off.\nTotal AUM was $49.4 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $5.0 billion, or 11%, compared to $44.4 billion at December 31, 2018. This was driven by $6.3 billion of inflows primarily due to new U.S. and Europe CLO issuances, as well as additional closes in CCOF. Also driving the increase was market and other activity of $1.2 billion, the majority of which was attributable to increases in the gross asset value of our BDC's and securitization vehicles. Partially offsetting the increase were outflows of $2.4 billion primarily related to distributions in our Energy Credit and Aviation funds, as well as CLO run-off.\nTotal AUM was $44.4 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $11.1 billion, or 33%, compared to $33.3 billion at December 31, 2017. This was driven by $12.1 billion of inflows primarily due to the acquisition of Carlyle Aviation Partners, as well as new U.S. and Europe CLO issuances and additional closes in our second BDC. Partially offsetting the increase were outflows of $1.1 billion primarily related to CLO run-off and distributions in our Global Credit carry funds.\nFund Performance Metrics\nFund performance information for certain of our Global Credit Funds is included throughout this discussion and analysis to facilitate an understanding of our results of operations for the periods presented.

For CSP II and CSP III, reflects amounts net of investment level recallable proceeds which is adjusted to reflect recyclability of invested capital for the purpose of calculating the fund MOIC.\n(2) Represents all realized proceeds since inception of the fund.\n(3) Represents remaining fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried interest, and may include remaining escrow values for realized investments.\n(4) Multiple of invested capital ( MOIC\u201d) represents total fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried interest, divided by cumulative invested capital.\n(5) Gross Internal Rate of Return ( Gross IRR\u201d) represents an annualized time-weighted return on Limited Partner invested capital, based on contributions, distributions and unrealized fair value as of the reporting date, before the impact of management fees, partnership expenses and carried interest. For fund vintages 2017 and after, Gross IRR includes the impact of interest expense related to the funding of investments on fund lines of credit. Gross IRR is calculated based on the timing of Limited Partner cash flows, which may differ to varying degrees from the timing of actual investment cash flows for the fund. Subtotal Gross IRR aggregations for multiple funds are calculated based on actual cash flow dates for each fund and represent a theoretical time-weighted return for a Limited Partner who invested sequentially in each fund.\n(6) Net Internal Rate of Return ( Net IRR\u201d) represents an annualized time-weighted return on Limited Partner invested capital, based on contributions, distributions and unrealized fair value as of the reporting date, after the impact of all management fees, partnership expenses and carried interest, including current accruals. Net IRR is calculated based on the timing of Limited Partner cash flows, which may differ to varying degrees from the timing of actual investment cash flows for the fund. Fund level IRRs are based on aggregate Limited Partner cash flows, and this blended return may differ from that of individual Limited Partners. As a result, certain funds may generate accrued performance revenues with a blended Net IRR that is below the preferred return hurdle for that fund. Subtotal Net IRR aggregations for multiple funds are calculated based on actual cash flow dates for each fund and represent a theoretical time-weighted return for a Limited Partner who invested sequentially in each fund.\n(7) Represents the net accrued performance fee balance/(giveback obligation) as of the current quarter end.\n(8) For funds marked NM,\u201d IRR may be positive or negative, but is not considered meaningful because of the limited time since initial investment and early stage of capital deployment. For funds marked Neg,\u201d IRR is considered meaningful but is negative as of reporting period end.\n(9) Aggregate includes the following funds, as well as all active co-investments, separately managed accounts (SMA's), and stand-alone investments arranged by us: SASOF II, SASOF III, and SASOF IV.\n(10) Aggregate includes the following funds, as well as related co-investments, separately managed accounts (SMA's), and certain other stand-alone investments arranged by us: CSP I, CMP I, CMP II, and CASCOF.\nInvestment Solutions\nThe following table presents our results of operations for our Investment Solutions segment:\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fund level fee revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fund management fees </td> <td>$ </td> <td>193.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>157.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>166.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Portfolio advisory and transaction fees, net and other </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total fund level fee revenues </td> <td>193.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>157.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>167.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized performance revenues </td> <td>155.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>106.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized principal investment income </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues </td> <td>351.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>231.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>275.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation and benefits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash-based compensation and benefits </td> <td>113.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>92.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized performance revenues related compensation </td> <td>144.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total compensation and benefits </td> <td>258.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>160.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>188.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General, administrative, and other indirect expenses </td> <td>37.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization expense </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>9.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses </td> <td>309.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>212.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>236.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(=) Distributable Earnings </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(-) Realized Net Performance Revenues </td> <td>10.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(-) Realized Principal Investment Income </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(+) Net Interest </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(=) Fee Related Earnings </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019 and Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nDistributable Earnings\nDistributable earnings increased $22.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, and decreased $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018.

Realized net performance revenues increased $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, and decreased $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. Substantially all of the realized net performance revenues were generated from AlpInvest carry fund vehicles for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Performance revenues from our Investment Solutions segment pay a higher ratio of performance revenues as compensation, primarily as a result of the terms of our acquisition of AlpInvest. Under our arrangements with the historical owners and management team of AlpInvest, we generally do not retain any carried interest with respect to the historical investments and commitments to our AlpInvest fund vehicles that existed as of July 1, 2011 (including any options to increase any such commitments exercised after such date). We are entitled to 15% of the carried interest with respect to commitments from the historical owners of AlpInvest for the period between 2011 and 2020, except in certain instances, and 40% of the carried interest in respect of all other commitments (including all future commitments from third parties). As funds that have launched since our acquisition of AlpInvest in 2011 begin to realize performance revenues, an increasing share of net realized performance revenues will be for our benefit.\nFee Related Earnings\nFee related earnings increased $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, and decreased $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018.

Total fee revenues increased $36.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to increased management fees from our private equity fund vehicles driven by the activation of management fees on our latest secondaries fund and higher catch-up management fees on our real estate fund-of-fund vehicles.\nTotal fee revenues decreased $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to decreased management fees from our private equity fund vehicles and lower catch-up management fees on our real estate fund-of-fund vehicles. In addition, realizations outpaced new fundraising, leading to lower Fee-earning AUM.\nCash-based compensation and benefits expense. Cash-based compensation and benefits expense increased $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to an increase in 2020 cash bonuses.\nCash-based compensation and benefits expense increased $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to an increase in headcount and 2019 cash bonuses.\nGeneral, administrative and other indirect expenses. General, administrative and other indirect expenses increased $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to increased professional fees, partially offset by the allocated portion of the cost recovery associated with the CCC matter of $3.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020 (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.) and lower travel and entertainment expenses as a result of travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFee-earning AUM as of and for each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2020\nFee-earning AUM is presented below for each period together with the components of change during each respective period.\nThe table below breaks out Fee-earning AUM by its respective components during the period.\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Solutions </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of Fee-earning AUM (1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM based on capital commitments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,871 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,430 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,355 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM based on invested capital (2) </td> <td>2,319 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,118 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,657 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM based on net asset value </td> <td>3,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>662 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>942 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM based on lower of cost or fair market value </td> <td>13,028 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,174 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,111 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Fee-earning AUM </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,398 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,065 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)For additional information concerning the components of Fee-earning AUM, see -Fee-earning Assets under Management.\u201d\n(2)Includes amounts committed to or reserved for certain AlpInvest and Metropolitan carry funds.\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Solutions </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM Rollforward </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, Beginning of Period </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,065 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,150 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inflows (1) </td> <td>10,713 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,708 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,092 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outflows (including realizations) (2) </td> <td>(3,710) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,039) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,035) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Activity & Other (3) </td> <td>(778) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(74) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign Exchange (4) </td> <td>1,789 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(407) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,068) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, End of Period </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,398 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,065 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Inflows represents limited partner capital raised by our carry funds or separately managed accounts for which management fees based on commitments were activated during the period and the fee-earning commitments invested in\nvehicles for which management fees are based on invested capital. Inflows exclude fundraising amounts during the period for which fees have not yet been activated, which are referenced as Pending Fee-earning AUM.\n(2)Outflows represents the impact of realizations from vehicles with management fees based on remaining invested capital at cost or fair value, changes in basis for funds where the investment period, weighted-average investment period or commitment fee period has expired during the period, and reductions for funds that are no longer calling for fees. Distributions for funds earning management fees based on commitments during the period do not affect Fee-earning AUM.\n(3)Market Activity & Other represents realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments in our carry funds based on the lower of cost or fair value and net asset value.\n(4)Foreign Exchange represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated funds. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the period end.\nFee-earning AUM was $36.4 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $8.0 billion, or 28%, compared to $28.4 billion at December 31, 2019. This increase was driven by inflows of $10.7 billion primarily attributable to fundraising in our AlpInvest funds as well as capital deployed in our AlpInvest funds which charge fees based on invested capital. Foreign exchange activity related to the translation of our AlpInvest Fee-earning AUM from EUR to USD resulted in an increase in Fee-earning AUM of $1.8 billion. Partially offsetting this increase were outflows of $3.7 billion primarily attributable to distributions in our AlpInvest funds. Distributions from funds still in the commitment or weighted-average investment period do not impact Fee-earning AUM as these funds are based on commitments and not invested capital. Increases in fair value may have an impact on Fee-earning AUM for Investment Solutions as the management fees for many fully committed funds are based on fair value or on the lower of cost or fair value of the underlying investments.\nFee-earning AUM was $28.4 billion at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $0.7 billion, or 2%, compared to $29.1 billion at December 31, 2018. This decrease was driven by outflows of $4.0 billion primarily attributable to distributions in our AlpInvest funds as well as $0.4 billion of foreign exchange activity related to the translation of our AlpInvest Fee-earning AUM from EUR to USD. Partially offsetting this decrease were inflows of $3.7 billion primarily attributable to fundraising in our AlpInvest funds as well as capital deployed in our AlpInvest funds which charge fees based on invested capital.\nFee-earning AUM was $29.1 billion at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $1.1 billion, or 4%, compared to $30.2 billion at December 31, 2017. This decrease was driven by outflows of $5.0 billion primarily attributable to distributions in our AlpInvest funds as well as $1.1 billion of foreign exchange activity related to the translation of our AlpInvest Fee-earning AUM from EUR to USD. Partially offsetting this decrease were inflows of $5.1 billion primarily attributable to fundraising in our AlpInvest and MRE funds.\nTotal AUM as of and for each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2020\nThe table below provides the period to period rollforward of Total AUM.\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Solutions </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total AUM Rollforward </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, Beginning of Period </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,246 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,654 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46,291 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inflows (1) </td> <td>13,855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,969 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,063 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outflows (including realizations) (2) </td> <td>(7,721) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,887) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,480) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Activity & Other (3) </td> <td>3,566 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,008 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,488 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign Exchange (4) </td> <td>3,162 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(498) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,708) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, End of Period </td> <td>$ </td> <td>58,108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,246 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,654 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Inflows reflects the impact of gross fundraising during the period.

The fair market values for our Investment Solutions primary and secondary carry funds are based on the latest available valuations of the underlying limited partnership interests as provided by their general partners which typically has a lag of up to 90 days, plus the net cash flows since the latest valuation, up to December 31, 2020.\n(4)Foreign Exchange represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated funds. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the period end.\nTotal AUM was $58.1 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of $12.9 billion, or 29%, compared to $45.2 billion as of December 31, 2019. Driving this increase were $13.9 billion of inflows principally from new commitments raised in our AlpInvest secondaries and coinvestment programs, $3.6 billion of market and other activity, and $3.2 billion of foreign exchange gains related to the translation of our AlpInvest AUM from EUR to USD. Offsetting the increase were $7.7 billion of outflows primarily due to distributions in our AlpInvest funds.\nTotal AUM was $45.2 billion as of December 31, 2019, a decrease of $0.5 billion, or 1%, compared to $45.7 billion as of December 31, 2018. Driving this decrease were $7.9 billion of outflows primarily due to distributions in our AlpInvest funds and $0.5 billion of foreign exchange losses related to the translation of our AlpInvest AUM from EUR to USD. Offsetting the decrease were $3.0 billion of inflows from new commitments raised in our AlpInvest and MRE funds, and $5.0 billion of market and other activity. Market appreciation was driven by 15% appreciation in our AlpInvest funds and 3% appreciation in our MRE funds.\nTotal AUM was $45.7 billion as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $0.6 billion, or 1%, compared to $46.3 billion as of December 31, 2017. Driving this decrease were $9.5 billion of outflows primarily due to distributions in our AlpInvest funds and $1.7 billion of foreign exchange losses related to the translation of our AlpInvest AUM from EUR to USD. Offsetting the decrease were $4.1 billion of inflows from new commitments raised in our AlpInvest and MRE funds, and $6.5 billion of market and other activity. Market appreciation was driven by 19% appreciation in our AlpInvest funds and 8% appreciation in our MRE funds.\nFund Performance Metrics\nFund performance information for our investment funds that have at least $1.0 billion in capital commitments, cumulative equity invested or total value as of December 31, 2020, which we refer to as our significant funds,\u201d is generally included throughout this discussion and analysis to facilitate an understanding of our results of operations for the periods presented.

Excluded from the performance information shown are a) investments that were not originated by AlpInvest, b) Direct Investments, which was spun off from AlpInvest in 2005, and c) LP co-investment vehicles advised by AlpInvest. As of December 31, 2020, these excluded investments represent $1.5 billion of AUM at AlpInvest.\n(2) Represents the original cost of investments since inception of the fund.\n(3) To exclude the impact of FX, all foreign currency cash flows have been converted to the currency representing a majority of the capital committed to the relevant fund at the reporting period spot rate.\n(4) Represents all realized proceeds combined with remaining fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried interest.\n(5) Multiple of invested capital ( MOIC\u201d) represents total fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried interest, divided by cumulative invested capital.\n(6) Gross Internal Rate of Return ( Gross IRR\u201d) represents the annualized IRR for the period indicated on Limited Partner invested capital based on investment contributions, distributions and unrealized value of the underlying funds, before management fees, expenses and carried interest at the AlpInvest/Metropolitan Real Estate level.\n(7) Net Internal Rate of Return ( Net IRR\u201d) represents the annualized IRR for the period indicated on Limited Partner invested capital based on contributions, distributions and unrealized value after management fees, expenses and carried interest. Fund level IRRs are based on aggregate Limited Partner cash flows, and this blended return may differ from that of individual Limited Partners. As a result, certain funds may generate accrued performance revenues with a blended Net IRR that is below the preferred return hurdle for that fund.\n(8) As used herein, \u2018Main Funds' are each comprised of (i) an anchor mandate(s) (i.e., generally the largest account(s) within a strategy's investment program) and (ii) AlpInvest's other advisory client mandates with investment periods that fall within the relevant investment periods under the mandate of the anchor mandate(s) (but do not overlap with more than one such investment period). AlpInvest's commingled funds, AlpInvest Secondaries Fund VI ( ASF VI\u201d), ASF VII and AlpInvest Co-Investment Fund VII ( ACF VII\u201d) are part of the Main Funds. Mezzanine Main Funds include mezzanine investments across all strategies (i.e., Primary Funds, Secondaries, and Co-Investments).\n(9) Aggregate includes Main Fund VII - Fund Investments, Main Fund VIII - Fund Investments, Main Fund IX - Fund Investments, Main Fund X - Fund Investments, Main Fund XI - Fund Investments, Main Fund IV - Mezzanine Investments, Main Fund V - Mezzanine Investments, all \u2018clean technology' private equity investments, all strategic co-investment mandates that invest in co-investment opportunities arising out of an investor's own separate private equity relationships and invitations, all strategic capital mandates, any state-focused investment mandates, and all other investors whose investments are not reflected in a Main Fund.\n(10) For funds marked NM,\u201d IRR may be positive or negative, but is not considered meaningful because of the limited time since initial investment and early stage of capital deployment. For funds marked Neg,\u201d IRR is considered meaningful but is negative as of reporting period end.\n(11) For purposes of aggregation, funds that report in foreign currency have been converted to U.S. dollars at the reporting period spot rate.\n(12) Represents the net accrued performance fee balance/(giveback obligation) as of the current quarter end.\n(13) \"Main Fund\" entries represent a combination of a commingled fund and SMA vehicles which together comprise a \"program\" vintage. Indented lines shown for AlpInvest Secondaries Funds VII, VI and AlpInvest Co-Investment Fund VII reflect a breakout of the commingled fund, which is part of the larger program vintage.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nHistorical Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have historically required limited capital resources to support the working capital and operating needs of our business. Our management fees have largely covered our operating costs and all realized performance allocations, after covering the related compensation, are available for distribution to equityholders. Approximately 95% - 97% of all capital commitments to our funds have been provided by our fund investors, with the remaining amount typically funded by our senior Carlyle professionals, advisors and other professionals.\nOur Sources of Liquidity\nWe have multiple sources of liquidity to meet our capital needs, including cash on hand, annual cash flows, accumulated earnings and funds from our senior revolving credit facility, which has $775.0 million of available capacity as of December 31, 2020. We believe these sources will be sufficient to fund our capital needs for at least the next twelve months.\nCash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents were approximately $987.6 million at December 31, 2020. However, a portion of this cash is allocated for specific business purposes, including, but not limited to, (i) performance allocations and incentive fee-related cash that has been received but not yet distributed as performance allocations and incentive fee related compensation and amounts owed to non-controlling interests; (ii) proceeds received from realized investments that are allocable to non-controlling interests; and (iii) regulatory capital.\nCorporate Treasury Investments. These investments represent investments in U.S. Treasury and government agency obligations, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, other investment grade securities and other investments with original\nmaturities of greater than three months when purchased. There were no corporate treasury investments as of December 31, 2020.\nAfter deducting cash amounts allocated to the specific requirements mentioned above, the remaining cash and cash equivalents is approximately $880 million as of December 31, 2020. This remaining amount will be used towards our primary liquidity needs, as outlined in the next section. This amount does not take into consideration ordinary course of business payables and reserves for specific business purposes.\nSenior Revolving Credit Facility. On February 11, 2019, the Company entered into an amendment and restatement of its senior revolving credit facility. The capacity under the revolving credit facility is $775.0 million and is scheduled to mature on February 11, 2024. Principal amounts outstanding under the amended and restated revolving credit facility accrue interest, at the option of the borrowers, either (a) at an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin not to exceed 0.50% per annum, or (b) at LIBOR plus an applicable margin not to exceed 1.50% per annum (1.40% at December 31, 2020).\nThe senior revolving credit facility is unsecured. We are required to maintain management fee earning assets (as defined in the amended and restated senior revolving credit facility) of at least $75.0 billion and a total leverage ratio of less than 3.0 to 1.0, in each case, tested on a quarterly basis. Non-compliance with any of the financial or non-financial covenants without cure or waiver would constitute an event of default under the senior revolving credit facility. An event of default resulting from a breach of certain financial or non-financial covenants may result, at the option of the lenders, in an acceleration of the principal and interest outstanding, and a termination of the senior revolving credit facility. The senior credit facility also contains other customary events of default, including defaults based on events of bankruptcy and insolvency, nonpayment of principal, interest or fees when due, breach of specified covenants, change in control and material inaccuracy of representations and warranties.\nGlobal Credit Revolving Credit Facility. In December 2018, certain subsidiaries of the Company established a $250.0 million revolving line of credit, primarily intended to support certain lending activities within the Global Credit segment. The credit facility includes a $125.0 million line of credit with a one-year team, which was amended in December 2020 to extend its maturity to December 2021, and a $125.0 million line of credit with a three-year term. Principal amounts outstanding under the facility accrue interest, at the option of the borrowers, either (a) at an alternate base rate plus applicable margin not to exceed 1.00%, or (b) at the Eurocurrency rate plus an applicable margin not to exceed 2.00%. As of December 31, 2020, there was no outstanding balance under this facility.\nCLO Borrowings. For certain of our CLOs, the Company finances a portion of its investment in the CLOs through the proceeds received from term loans with financial institutions. The Company's outstanding CLO term loans were $356.1 million and $324.9 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The CLO term loans are secured by the Company's investments in the respective CLO, have a general unsecured interest in the Carlyle entity that manages the CLO, and generally do not have recourse to any other Carlyle entity. As of December 31, 2020, $336.5 million of these loans are secured by investments attributable to The Carlyle Group Inc. See Note 7 of our financial statements for more information on our CLO term loans.\nSenior Notes. Certain indirect finance subsidiaries of the Company have issued senior notes, on which interest is payable semi-annually, as discussed below. The senior notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the respective subsidiary and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Company and each of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships. The indentures governing each of the senior notes contain customary covenants that, among other things, limit the issuers' and the guarantors' ability, subject to certain exceptions, to incur indebtedness secured by liens on voting stock or profit participating equity interests of their subsidiaries or merge, consolidate or sell, transfer or lease assets. The notes also contain customary events of default. All or a portion of the notes may be redeemed at our option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, prior to their stated maturity, at the make-whole redemption price set forth in the notes. If a change of control repurchase event occurs, the notes are subject to repurchase at the repurchase price as set forth in the notes.\n3.500% Senior Notes. In September 2019, Carlyle Finance Subsidiary L.L.C. issued $425.0 million of 3.500% senior notes due September 19, 2029 at 99.841% of par.\n5.650% Senior Notes. In September 2018, Carlyle Finance L.L.C. issued $350.0 million of 5.650% senior notes due September 15, 2048 at 99.914% of par.\n3.875% Senior Notes. In January 2013, Carlyle Holdings Finance L.L.C. issued $500.0 million of 3.875% senior notes due February 1, 2023 at 99.966% of par. In September 2018, we completed a tender offer to purchase $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of these notes. As of December 31, 2020, $250.0 million of these notes remain outstanding.\n5.625% Senior Notes. In March 2013, Carlyle Holdings II Finance L.L.C. issued $400.0 million of 5.625% senior notes due March 30, 2043 at 99.583% of par. In March 2014, an additional $200.0 million of these notes were issued at 104.315% of par and are treated as a single class with the already outstanding $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of these notes.\nPromissory Notes. In June 2017, as part of the settlement with investors in two commodities investment vehicles managed by an affiliate of the Company (discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements), the Company issued a series of promissory notes, aggregating to $53.9 million, to the investors of these commodities investment vehicles. Interest on these promissory notes accrued at the three month LIBOR plus 2%. These promissory notes matured on July 15, 2019 and were fully repaid as of that date.\nObligations of CLOs. Loans payable of the Consolidated Funds represent amounts due to holders of debt securities issued by the CLOs. We are not liable for any loans payable of the CLOs. Several of the CLOs issued preferred shares representing the most subordinated interest, however these tranches are mandatorily redeemable upon the maturity dates of the senior secured loans payable, and as a result have been classified as liabilities under U.S. GAAP, and are included in loans payable of Consolidated Funds in our consolidated balance sheets. Loans payable of the CLOs are collateralized by the assets held by the CLOs and the assets of one CLO may not be used to satisfy the liabilities of another. This collateral consists of cash and cash equivalents, corporate loans, corporate bonds and other securities.\nPreferred Units. In September 2017, we issued 16 million of our Preferred Units for net proceeds of approximately $387.5 million. In October 2019, we completed the redemption of our Preferred Units for $25.339757 per unit, which is equal to $25.25 per preferred unit plus declared and unpaid distributions to, but excluding, the redemption date.\nRealized Performance Allocation Revenues. Another source of liquidity we may use to meet our capital needs is the realized performance allocation revenues generated by our investment funds. Performance allocations are generally realized when an underlying investment is profitably disposed of and the fund's cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred return. For certain funds, performance allocations are realized once all invested capital and expenses have been returned to the fund's investors and the fund's cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred return. Incentive fees earned on our CLO vehicles generally are paid upon the dissolution of such vehicles.\nOur accrued performance allocations by segment as of December 31, 2020, gross and net of accrued giveback obligations, are set forth below:\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset Class </td> <td>Accrued\nPerformance\nAllocations </td> <td> </td> <td>Accrued\nGiveback\nObligation </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Accrued\nPerformance\nRevenues </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global Private Equity </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,926.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(18.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,907.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global Credit </td> <td>132.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>132.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Solutions (1)\n</td> <td>910.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>910.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,968.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(18.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,949.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Accrued performance allocation-related compensation </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,534.4) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Deferred taxes on certain foreign accrued performance allocations </td> <td> </td> <td>(56.0) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Net accrued performance allocations attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated entities </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.7) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net accrued performance revenues before timing differences </td> <td> </td> <td>2,347.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less/Plus: Timing differences between the period when accrued performance revenues are realized and the period they are collected/distributed </td> <td> </td> <td>(16.5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net accrued performance revenues attributable to The Carlyle Group Inc. </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,331.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The Company's primary and secondary investments in external funds are generally valued based on its proportionate share of the net assets provided by the third party general partners of the underlying fund partnerships based on the most recent available information which typically has a lag of up to 90 days.

Another source of liquidity we may use to meet our capital needs is the realized principal investment income generated by our equity method investments and other principal investments. Principal investment income is realized when we redeem all or a portion of our investment or when we receive or are due cash income, such as dividends or distributions. Certain of the investments attributable to The Carlyle Group Inc. (excluding certain general partner interests, strategic investments, and investments in certain CLOs) may be sold at our discretion as a source of liquidity.\nInvestments as of December 31, 2020 consist of the following:\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Investments in Carlyle Funds </td> <td> </td> <td>Investments in NGP (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments, excluding performance allocations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,038.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>373.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,412.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Amounts attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated entities </td> <td>(214.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(214.3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Investments in Consolidated Funds, eliminated in consolidation </td> <td>170.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>170.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Strategic equity method investments in NGP Management </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(373.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(373.5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investments attributable to The Carlyle Group Inc., exclusive of NGP Management </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,995.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,995.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOur investments as of December 31, 2020 can be further attributed as follows:\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments in Carlyle Funds, excluding CLOs: </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global Private Equity funds(1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>676.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global Credit funds(2)\n</td> <td>671.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Solutions funds(3)\n</td> <td>57.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investments in Carlyle Funds, excluding CLOs </td> <td>1,405.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments in CLOs </td> <td>502.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other investments </td> <td>87.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investments attributable to The Carlyle Group Inc. </td> <td>1,995.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CLO loans and other borrowings attributable to The Carlyle Group Inc.

As a result, amounts presented may not include the impact of economic activity in the current quarter.\n(4) Of the $356.1 million in total CLO term loans outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and as disclosed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, $336.5 million are collateralized by investments attributable to The Carlyle Group Inc.\nOur Liquidity Needs\nWe generally use our working capital and cash flows to invest in growth initiatives, service our debt, fund the working capital needs of our business and investment funds and pay dividends to our common stockholders.\nIn the future, we expect that our primary liquidity needs will be to:\n\u2022provide capital to facilitate the growth of our existing business lines;\n\u2022provide capital to facilitate our expansion into new, complementary business lines, including acquisitions;\n\u2022pay operating expenses, including compensation and compliance costs and other obligations as they arise;\n\u2022fund costs of litigation and contingencies, including related legal costs;\n\u2022fund the capital investments of Carlyle in our funds;\n\u2022fund capital expenditures;\n\u2022repay borrowings and related interest costs and expenses;\n\u2022pay earnouts and contingent cash consideration associated with our acquisitions and strategic investments;\n\u2022pay income taxes, including corporate income taxes;\n\u2022pay dividends to our common stockholders in accordance with our dividend policy;\n\u2022make installment payments under the deferred obligation to former holders of Carlyle Holdings partnership units, which were exchanged in the Conversion, and;\n\u2022repurchase our common stock.\nPreferred Unit Distributions and Redemption. With respect to distribution year 2019, the Board of Directors declared a distribution to preferred unitholders totaling approximately $19.1 million. In October 2019, we completed the redemption of our preferred units for $25.339757 per unit, which is equal to $25.25 per Preferred Unit plus declared and unpaid distributions to, but excluding, the redemption date.\nCommon Stockholder Dividends. Our intention is to pay dividends to holders of our common stock in an amount of $0.25 per share of common stock ($1.00 per share annually), subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and compliance with applicable law. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, any dividends we pay following the Conversion generally will be treated as qualified dividend income (generally taxable to U.S. individual stockholders at capital gain rates) paid by a domestic corporation to the extent paid out of current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes, with any excess dividends treated as return of capital to the extent of the stockholder's basis. The declaration and payment of dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors, and our dividend policy may be changed at any time.\nIn 2020, our Board of Directors has declared cumulative dividends to common stockholders totaling approximately $352.6 million, or $1.00 per common share, consisting of the following:\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common Stock Dividends - Dividend Year 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarter </td> <td>Dividend per Common Share </td> <td>Dividend to Common Stockholders (1)\n</td> <td>Record Date </td> <td>Payment Date </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Q1 2020 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.25 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>May 12, 2020 </td> <td>May 19, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Q2 2020 </td> <td>0.25 </td> <td> </td> <td>88.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>August 11, 2020 </td> <td>August 18, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Q3 2020 </td> <td>0.25 </td> <td> </td> <td>88.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>November 10, 2020 </td> <td>November 17, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Q4 2020 </td> <td>0.25 </td> <td> </td> <td>88.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>February 16, 2021 </td> <td>February 23, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.00 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>352.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2019, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of approximately $194.8 million to common stockholders, consisting of the following:\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common Stock Dividends - Dividend Year 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarter </td> <td>Dividend per Common Share </td> <td>Dividend to Common Stockholders </td> <td>Record Date </td> <td>Payment Date </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Q1 2019 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.19 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>May 13, 2019 </td> <td>May 20, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Q2 2019 </td> <td>0.43 </td> <td> </td> <td>49.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>August 12, 2019 </td> <td>August 19, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Q3 2019 </td> <td>0.31 </td> <td> </td> <td>36.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>November 12, 2019 </td> <td>November 19, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Q4 2019 </td> <td>0.25 </td> <td> </td> <td>87.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>February 18, 2020 </td> <td>February 25, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.18 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>194.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The dividend to common stockholders for Q4 2019 reflects the exchange of all Carlyle Holdings partnership\nunits to shares of common stock in The Carlyle Group Inc. in connection with the Conversion on January 1, 2020.\nIn 2018, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of approximately $144.1 million to common stockholders, consisting of the following:\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common Stock Dividends - Dividend Year 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarter </td> <td>Dividend per Common Share </td> <td>Dividend to Common Stockholders </td> <td>Record Date </td> <td>Payment Date </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Q1 2018 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.27 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>May 11, 2018 </td> <td>May 17, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Q2 2018 </td> <td>0.22 </td> <td> </td> <td>23.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>August 13, 2018 </td> <td>August 17, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Q3 2018 </td> <td>0.42 </td> <td> </td> <td>45.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>November 13, 2018 </td> <td>November 20, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Q4 2018 </td> <td>0.43 </td> <td> </td> <td>47.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>February 19, 2019 </td> <td>February 26, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.34 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>144.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFund Commitments. Generally, we intend to have Carlyle commit to fund approximately 0.75% of the capital commitments to our future carry funds, although we may elect to invest additional amounts in funds focused on new investment areas. We may, from time to time, exercise our right to purchase additional interests in our investment funds that become\navailable in the ordinary course of their operations. We expect our senior Carlyle professionals and employees to continue to make significant capital contributions to our funds based on their existing commitments, and to make capital commitments to future funds consistent with the level of their historical commitments. We also intend to make investments in our open-end funds and our CLO vehicles. Our investments in our European CLO vehicles will comply with the risk retention rules as discussed in Risk Retention Rules\u201d later in this section.\nSince our inception through December 31, 2020, we and our senior Carlyle professionals, operating executives and other professionals have invested or committed to invest in or alongside our funds. Approximately 3% to 5% of all capital commitments to our funds are funded collectively by us and our senior Carlyle professionals, operating executives and other professionals.\nThe current unfunded commitment of Carlyle and our senior Carlyle professionals, operating executives and other professionals to our investment funds as of December 31, 2020, consisted of the following:\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset Class </td> <td> </td> <td>Unfunded\nCommitment </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global Private Equity </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,835.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global Credit </td> <td> </td> <td>333.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Solutions </td> <td> </td> <td>313.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,481.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nA substantial majority of the remaining commitments are expected to be funded by senior Carlyle professionals, operating executives and other professionals through our internal co-investment program. Of the $3.5 billion of unfunded commitments, approximately $3.0 billion is subscribed individually by senior Carlyle professionals, operating executives and other professionals, with the balance funded directly by the Company.\nRepurchase Program. In December 2018, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of common stock and/or Carlyle Holdings units. In January 2020 our Board of Directors re-authorized the repurchase program with regard or common stock. This program authorizes the repurchase of shares of common stock from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid an aggregate of $26.4 million to repurchase and retire approximately 1.1 million shares with all of the repurchases done via open market brokered transactions. As of December 31, 2020, $139.1 million of repurchase capacity remained under the program. In February 2021, our Board of Directors replenished the repurchase program to its limit of $200 million of common stock.\nThe significant captions and amounts from our consolidated statements of cash flows which include the effects of our Consolidated Funds and CLOs in accordance with U.S. GAAP are summarized below.\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statements of Cash Flows Data </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities, including investments in Carlyle funds and Fortitude Re </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(169.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>358.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(343.5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td>(61.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(99.1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities </td> <td>370.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(149.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of foreign exchange rate change </td> <td>21.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19.9) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td>$ </td> <td>161.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>189.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(390.5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities. Net cash used in operating activities was primarily driven by our earnings in the respective periods after adjusting for significant non-cash activity, including non-cash performance allocations and incentive fees, the related non-cash performance allocations and incentive fee related compensation, non-cash principal investment income, non-cash equity-based compensation, and depreciation, amortization and impairments, all of which are included in earnings.\nCash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, excluding the activities of our Consolidated Funds, were $716.8 million, $591.3 million and $461.2 million, respectively. Operating cash inflows primarily include the receipt of management fees and realized performance allocations and incentive fees, while operating cash\noutflows primarily include payments for operating expenses, including compensation and general, administrative, and other expenses. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, net cash provided by operating activities primarily includes the receipt of management fees and realized performance allocations and incentive fees, totaling approximately $2.1 billion, $1.9 billion, and $2.0 billion, respectively. These inflows were partially offset by payments for compensation and general, administrative, and other expenses of approximately $1.6 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nCash used to purchase investments as well as the proceeds from the sale of such investments are reflected in our cash flows from operating activities as this investment activity is a normal part of our operations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, investment proceeds were $307.5 million while investment purchases were $350.9 million, including $79.6 million related to a purchase price adjustment on our strategic investment in Fortitude Re. During the year ended December 31, 2019, investment proceeds were $389.2 million while investment purchases were $312.4 million. Investment proceeds in 2019 also included $71.5 million received from the resolution of French tax litigation. During the year ended December 31, 2018, investment proceeds were $893.4 million while investment purchases were $867.4 million, which included cash outflows of $393.8 million related to our investment in Fortitude Re.\nThe net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 also reflects the investment activity of our Consolidated Funds. For the year ended December 31, 2020, proceeds from the sales and settlements of investments by the Consolidated Funds were $2.0 billion, while purchases of investments by the Consolidated Funds were $3.1 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2019, proceeds from the sales and settlements of investments by the Consolidated Funds were $2.1 billion, while purchases of investments by the Consolidated Funds were $2.2 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2018, proceeds from the sales and settlements of investments by the Consolidated Funds were $2.7 billion, while purchases of investments by the Consolidated Funds were $3.7 billion.\nNet Cash Used In Investing Activities. Our investing activities generally reflect cash used for acquisitions and fixed assets and software for internal use. Purchases of fixed assets were $61.2 million, $27.8 million and $31.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in investing activities principally reflects the acquisition of Carlyle Aviation Partners.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities. In 2020, we received net proceeds of $294.1 million from borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, and repaid $329.9 million, and paid $68.8 million in January 2020 for the first installment of the deferred consideration payable to former Carlyle Holdings unitholders in connection with the Conversion. We also paid $26.4 million to repurchase and retire 1.1 million shares of common stock. In 2019, we received net proceeds of $420.6 million from the issuance of $425.0 million of 3.500% senior notes, and $41.0 million from the issuance of various CLO borrowings, paid $405.4 million to repurchase our outstanding Preferred Units, paid $34.5 million to repurchase 1.6 million units under our repurchase program and paid off a $25.0 million term loan. In 2018, we received net proceeds of $345.7 million from the issuance of $350.0 million of 5.650% senior notes, paid $255.1 million to repurchase $250.0 million of 3.875% senior notes, and paid $108.8 million to prepay the remaining balance outstanding under a promissory note to BNRI.\nDividends to our common stockholders were $351.3 million, $154.9 million, and $129.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Distributions to the non-controlling interest holders in Carlyle Holdings were $313.3 million and $288.8 million the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The net (payments) borrowings on loans payable by our Consolidated Funds during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $704.1 million, $224.8 million, and $818.0 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, contributions from non-controlling interest holders were $210.0 million, $57.8 million, and $31.3 million, respectively, which relate primarily to contributions from the non-controlling interest holders in Consolidated Funds. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, distributions to non-controlling interest holders were $77.8 million, $62.4 million, and $105.2 million, respectively, which relate primarily to distributions to the non-controlling interest holders in Consolidated Funds.\nOur Balance Sheet\nTotal assets were $15.6 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $1.8 billion from December 31, 2019. The increase in total assets was primarily attributable to increases in Investments of consolidated funds of $1.0 billion due to the formation of two CLOs during the year ended December 31, 2020, partially offset by the deconsolidation of the Renewable Energy fund. The increase in total assets was also driven by a $576.5 million increase in investments, including accrued performance allocations, as well as a $157.3 million increase in our lease right-of-use assets, net resulting from the start of our lease of our new New York office space in December 2020.\nTotal liabilities were $12.7 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $1,875.4 million from December 31, 2019. The increase in liabilities was primarily attributable to an increase in accrued compensation and benefits of $726.1 million primarily due to an increase in accrued performance allocations-related compensation and loans payable of Consolidated Funds of $856.3 million from December 31, 2019 to 2020, driven by the formation of two CLOs during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe assets and liabilities of the Consolidated Funds are generally held within separate legal entities and, as a result, the assets of the Consolidated Funds are not available to meet our liquidity requirements and similarly the liabilities of the Consolidated Funds are non-recourse to us. For example, as previously discussed, the CLO term loans generally are secured by the Company's investment in the CLO, have a general unsecured interest in the Carlyle entity that manages the CLO, and do not have recourse to any other Carlyle entity.\nOur balance sheet without the effect of the Consolidated Funds can be seen in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. At December 31, 2020, our total assets were $9.5 billion, including cash and cash equivalents totaling $987.6 million and net accrued performance revenues of $2.3 billion.\nUnconsolidated Entities\nCertain of our global private equity funds have entered into lines of credit secured by their investors' unpaid capital commitments or by a pledge of the equity of the underlying investment. These lines of credit are used primarily to reduce the overall number of capital calls to investors or for working capital needs. In certain instances, however, they may be used for other investment related activities, including serving as bridge financing for investments. The degree of leverage employed varies among portfolio companies.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into various off-balance sheet arrangements including sponsoring and owning limited or general partner interests in consolidated and non-consolidated funds, entering into derivative transactions, and entering into guarantee arrangements. We also have ongoing capital commitment arrangements with certain of our consolidated and non-consolidated funds. We do not have any other off-balance sheet arrangements that would require us to fund losses or guarantee target returns to investors in any of our other investment funds.\nFor further information regarding our off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 2 and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 on a consolidated basis and on a basis excluding the obligations of the Consolidated Funds:\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022-2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>2024-2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations (including senior notes)(a)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>271.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,624.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,980.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payable(b)\n</td> <td>86.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>163.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>145.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,087.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,483.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other consideration(c)\n</td> <td>121.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>223.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>413.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease obligations(d)\n</td> <td>47.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>116.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>397.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>663.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital commitments to Carlyle funds(e)\n</td> <td>3,501.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,616.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax receivable agreement payments(f)\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans payable of Consolidated Funds(g)\n</td> <td>95.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>190.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>190.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,126.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,602.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unfunded commitments of the CLOs(h)\n</td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated contractual obligations </td> <td>3,857.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>987.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>712.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,305.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,862.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans payable of Consolidated Funds(g)\n</td> <td>(95.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(190.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(190.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,126.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,602.3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital commitments to Carlyle funds(e)\n</td> <td>(2,959.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,959.8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unfunded commitments of the CLOs(h)\n</td> <td>(5.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Carlyle Operating Entities contractual obligations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>797.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>796.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>521.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,179.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,295.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)The table above assumes that no prepayments are made on the senior notes. The CLO terms loans are included in the table above based on the earlier of the stated maturity date or the date the CLO is expected to be dissolved. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for the various maturity dates of the CLO term loans and senior notes.\n(b)The interest rates on the debt obligations as of December 31, 2020 consist of: 3.500% on $425.0 million of senior notes, 5.650% on $350 million of senior notes, 3.875% on $250.0 million of senior notes, 5.625% on $600.0 million of senior notes, and a range of approximately 1.58% to 2.63% for our CLO term loans. Interest payments assume that no prepayments are made and loans are held until maturity with the exception of the CLO term loans, which are based on the earlier of the stated maturity date or the date the CLO is expected to be dissolved.\n(c)These obligations represent our estimate of amounts to be paid on the contingent cash and other obligations associated with our acquisition of Carlyle Aviation Partners (see Note 3) and other obligations, as well as the deferred payment obligations described below. In connection with the Conversion, former holders of Carlyle Holdings partnership units will receive cash payments aggregating to approximately $344 million, which is equivalent to $1.50 per Carlyle Holdings partnership unit exchanged in the Conversion, payable in five annual installments of $0.30, the first of which occurred during the first quarter of 2020. The payment obligations are unsecured obligations of the Company or a subsidiary thereof, subordinated in right of payment to indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries, and do not bear interest.\n(d)We lease office space in various countries around the world and maintain our headquarters in Washington, D.C., where we have a non-cancelable lease agreement expiring on March 31, 2030. We entered into a non-cancelable lease agreement expiring in 2036 for new office space in New York City that commenced in 2020. Our office leases in other locations expire in various years through 2032. The amounts in this table represent the minimum lease payments required over the term of the lease.\n(e)These obligations generally represent commitments by us to fund a portion of the purchase price paid for each investment made by our funds. Commitments to the funds are generally due on demand and are therefore presented in the less than one year category. A substantial majority of these investments is expected to be funded by senior Carlyle professionals and other professionals through our internal co-investment program. Of the $3.5 billion of unfunded commitments to the funds, approximately $3.0 billion is subscribed individually by senior Carlyle professionals, advisors and other professionals, with the balance funded directly by the Company.\n(f)In connection with our initial public offering, we entered into a tax receivable agreement with the limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships whereby we agreed to pay such limited partners 85% of the amount of cash tax savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax realized as a result of increases in tax basis resulting from exchanges of Carlyle Holdings partnership units for common units of The Carlyle Group L.P. From and after the consummation of the Conversion, holders of Carlyle Holdings partnership units do not have any rights to payments under the tax receivable agreement except for payment obligations pre-existing at the time of the Conversion with respect to exchanges that occurred prior to the Conversion. These obligations are more than offset by the future cash tax savings that we are expected to realize.\n(g)These obligations represent amounts due to holders of debt securities issued by the consolidated CLO vehicles. These obligations include interest to be paid on debt securities issued by the consolidated CLO vehicles. Interest payments assume that no prepayments are made and loans are held until maturity. For debt securities with rights only to the residual value of the CLO and no stated interest, no interest payments were included in this calculation. Interest payments on variable-rate debt securities are based on interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2020, at spreads to market rates pursuant to the debt agreements, and range from 0.40% to 8.03%.\n(h)These obligations represent commitments of the CLOs to fund certain investments. These amounts are generally due on demand and are therefore presented in the less than one year category.\nExcluded from the table above are liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $24.0 million at December 31, 2020 as we are unable to estimate when such amounts may be paid.\nContingent Cash Payments For Business Acquisitions and Strategic Investments\nWe have certain contingent cash obligations associated with our acquisition of Carlyle Aviation Partners and our strategic investment in Fortitude Re. For our acquisition of Carlyle Aviation Partners, the contingent cash payments relate to an earn-out of up to $150.0 million that is payable upon the achievement of certain revenue and earnings performance targets during 2020 through 2025, which will be accounted for as compensation expense. We accrue the compensation liability over the service period.\nFor our strategic investment in Fortitude Re, the contingent cash payment relates to performance-based contingent cash consideration payable to Carlyle FRL for further payment to AIG following December 31, 2023. Based on the terms of the underlying contracts, the maximum amount that could be paid from contingent cash obligations associated with the acquisition of Carlyle Aviation Partners and the strategic investment in Fortitude Re as of December 31, 2020 is $245.0 million versus amounts recognized on the balance sheet of $145.6 million.\nRisk Retention Rules\nWe will continue to comply with the risk retention rules governing CLOs issued in Europe for which we are a sponsor, which require a combination of capital from our balance sheet, commitments from senior Carlyle professionals, and/or third party financing.\nFor additional information related to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, see -Financial regulatory changes in the United States could adversely affect our business and the possibility of increased regulatory focus could result in additional burdens and expenses on our business\u201d within Item 1A.\nGuarantees\nSee Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information related to our material guarantees.\nIndemnifications\nIn many of our service contracts, we agree to indemnify the third-party service provider under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract, and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the estimate above or recorded in our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020.\nContingent Obligations (Giveback)\nCarried interest is ultimately realized when: (1) an underlying investment is profitably disposed of, (2) certain costs borne by the limited partner investors have been reimbursed, (3) the fund's cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred return and (4) we have decided to collect carry rather than return additional capital to limited partner investors. Realized carried interest may be required to be returned by us in future periods if the fund's investment values decline below certain levels. When the fair value of a fund's investments remains constant or falls below certain return hurdles, previously recognized performance allocations are reversed.\nSee Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our contingent obligations (giveback).\nOther Contingencies\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are a party to litigation, investigations, inquiries, employment-related matters, disputes and other potential claims. We discuss certain of these matters in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCarlyle Common Stock and Carlyle Holdings Partnership Units\nRollforwards of shares of our common stock outstanding and Carlyle Holdings partnership units for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Shares as of December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Shares\nIssued (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Shares\nForfeited </td> <td> </td> <td>Shares\nExchanged </td> <td> </td> <td>Shares Repurchased / Retired </td> <td> </td> <td>Shares as of December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Carlyle Group Inc. common shares </td> <td>117,840,651 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,452,114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>229,318,248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,090,437) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>353,520,576 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Carlyle Holdings partnership units </td> <td>229,318,248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(229,318,248) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>347,158,899 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,452,114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,090,437) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>353,520,576 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Shares as of December 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Shares\nIssued (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Shares\nForfeited </td> <td> </td> <td>Shares\nExchanged </td> <td> </td> <td>Shares Repurchased / Retired </td> <td> </td> <td>Shares as of December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Carlyle Group Inc. common shares </td> <td>107,746,443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,063,471 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,659,588 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,628,851) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>117,840,651 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Carlyle Holdings partnership units </td> <td>230,977,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,659,588) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>229,318,248 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>338,724,279 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,063,471 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,628,851) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>347,158,899 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Units issued include restricted common units and units issued and delivered in connection with our equity method investment in NGP.\nThe Carlyle Group Inc. common stock issued during the period presented in the tables above relate to the vesting of the Company's restricted stock units and shares issued and delivered in connection with our equity method investment in NGP during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe Carlyle Holdings partnership units exchanged during the year ended December 31, 2020 relate to the exchange of Carlyle Holdings partnership units for an equivalent number of shares of common stock of the Company on January 1, 2020 pursuant to the Conversion. The Carlyle Holdings partnership units exchanged during the year ended December 31, 2019 relate to the exchange of Carlyle Holdings partnership units held by NGP and certain limited partners for shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis. Beginning with the second quarter of 2017, senior Carlyle professionals were able to exchange their Carlyle Holdings partnership units for shares of common stock on a quarterly basis, subject to the terms of the Exchange Agreement.\nThe Carlyle Group Inc. common stock repurchased during the period presented in the tables above relate to shares repurchased during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and subsequently retired as part of our stock repurchase programs.\nThe total shares as of December 31, 2020 as shown above exclude approximately 1.3 million shares of common stock in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units subsequent to December 31, 2020 that will participate in the common stockholder dividend that will be paid.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation. The Company consolidates all entities that it controls either through a majority voting interest or as the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d). The Company describes the policies and procedures it uses in evaluating whether an entity is consolidated in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As part of its consolidation procedures, the Company evaluates: (1) whether it holds a variable interest in an entity, (2) whether the entity is a VIE, and (3) whether the Company's involvement would make it the primary beneficiary.\n\u2022In evaluating whether the Company holds a variable interest, fees (including management fees, incentive fees and performance allocations) that are customary and commensurate with the level of services provided, and where the Company does not hold other economic interests in the entity that would absorb more than an insignificant amount of the expected losses or returns of the entity, are not considered variable interests. The Company considers all economic interests, including indirect interests, to determine if a fee is considered a variable interest.\n\u2022For those entities where the Company holds a variable interest, the Company determines whether each of these entities qualifies as a VIE and, if so, whether or not the Company is the primary beneficiary. The assessment of whether the entity is a VIE is generally performed qualitatively, which requires judgment. These judgments include: (a) determining whether the equity investment at risk is sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, (b) evaluating whether the equity holders, as a group, can make decisions that have a significant effect on the economic performance of the entity, (c) determining whether two or more parties' equity interests should be aggregated, and (d) determining whether the equity investors have proportionate voting rights to their obligations to absorb losses or rights to receive returns from an entity.\n\u2022For entities that are determined to be VIEs, the Company consolidates those entities where it has concluded it is the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is defined as the variable interest holder with (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In evaluating whether the Company is the primary beneficiary, the Company evaluates its economic interests in the entity held either directly or indirectly by the Company.\nChanges to these judgments could result in a change in the consolidation conclusion for a legal entity.\nEntities that do not qualify as VIEs are generally assessed for consolidation as voting interest entities. Under the voting interest entity model, the Company consolidates those entities it controls through a majority voting interest.\nPerformance Allocations. Performance allocations consist principally of the allocation of profits from certain of the funds to which the Company is entitled (commonly known as carried interest). The Company is generally entitled to a 20% allocation (which can vary by fund) of the net realized income or gain as a carried interest after returning the invested capital, the allocation of preferred returns and return of certain fund costs (generally subject to catch-up provisions as set forth in the fund limited partnership agreement). Carried interest is ultimately realized when: (i) an underlying investment is profitably disposed of, (ii) certain costs borne by the limited partner investors have been reimbursed, (iii) the fund's cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred return and (iv) the Company has decided to collect carry rather than return additional capital to limited partner investors.\nWhile carried interest is recognized upon appreciation of the funds' investment values above certain return hurdles set forth in each respective partnership agreement, the Company recognizes revenues attributable to performance allocations based upon the amount that would be due pursuant to the fund partnership agreement at each period end as if the funds were terminated at that date. Accordingly, the amount recognized as performance allocations reflects the Company's share of the gains and losses of the associated funds' underlying investments measured at their then-current fair values relative to the fair values as of the end of the prior period. Because of the inherent uncertainty, these estimated values may differ significantly\nfrom the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and it is reasonably possible that the difference could be material. If, at December 31, 2020, all of the investments held by the Company's funds were deemed worthless, a possibility that management views as remote, the amount of realized and distributed carried interest subject to potential giveback would be $0.5 billion, on an after-tax basis where applicable.\nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information related to performance allocations for various fund types, preferred return hurdle rates, the timing of performance allocation recognition in investment income, and the potential for performance allocation income reversal.\nPerformance Allocation Related Compensation. A portion of the performance allocations earned is due to employees and advisers of the Company. These amounts are accounted for as compensation expense in conjunction with the recognition of the related performance allocation revenue and, until paid, are recognized as a component of the accrued compensation and benefits liability. Accordingly, upon a reversal of performance allocation revenue, the related compensation expense, if any, is also reversed.\nIncome Taxes. On January 1, 2020, the Company converted from The Carlyle Group L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, to The Carlyle Group Inc., a Delaware corporation. As a result, all of the income before provision for income taxes attributable to The Carlyle Group Inc. is subject to U.S. federal (and state and local) corporate income taxes. Based on applicable federal, foreign, state and local tax laws, the Company records a provision for income taxes for certain entities. Tax positions taken by the Company are subject to periodic audit by U.S. federal, state, local and foreign taxing authorities.\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the period in which the difference is expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period of the change in the provision for income taxes. Further, deferred tax assets are recognized for the expected realization of available net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. A valuation allowance is recorded on the Company's gross deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such asset will not be realized. When evaluating the realizability of the Company's deferred tax assets, all evidence, both positive and negative, is evaluated. Items considered in this analysis include the ability to carry back losses, the reversal of temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and expectations of future earnings. The Company has approximately $97 million of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2020. Changes in judgment as it relates to the realizability of these assets, as well as potential changes in corporate tax rates would have the effect of significantly reducing the value of the deferred tax assets.\nThe Conversion resulted in a step-up in the tax basis of certain assets that will be recovered as those assets are sold or the basis is amortized. We recorded an estimated net deferred tax asset of $262.1 million relating to this step-up in tax basis. The Conversion and subsequent exchange of Carlyle Holdings units for an equivalent number of shares of common stock of the Company also resulted in an estimated net reduction of the deferred tax asset of $388.1 million. This amount was generated by: (1) deferred tax liabilities on investments and accrued performance revenue allocations, net of related compensation, which were not previously subject to U.S. corporate income tax, (2) an increase in the historical net deferred tax assets reflecting deferred tax amounts previously allocated to private unitholders, and (3) a decrease in the historical net deferred tax assets reflecting the impact of reducing our effective state tax rate under the corporate structure. Together with the estimated step-up in tax basis, the Conversion resulted in an estimated net reduction to the Company's net deferred tax asset of $126.0 million due to the Conversion. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding the Conversion.\nUnder U.S. GAAP for income taxes, the amount of tax benefit to be recognized is the amount of benefit that is more likely than not\u201d to be sustained upon examination. The Company analyzes its tax filing positions in all of the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns, as well as for all open tax years in these jurisdictions. If, based on this analysis, the Company determines that uncertainties in tax positions exist, a liability is established, which is included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions in the provision for income taxes. If recognized, the entire amount of unrecognized tax positions would be recorded as a reduction in the provision for income taxes.\nFair Value Measurement. U.S. GAAP establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which ranks the observability of market price inputs used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. The observability of inputs is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, the characteristics specific to the financial instrument and the state of the\nmarketplace, including the existence and transparency of transactions between market participants. Financial instruments with readily available quoted prices, or for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in active markets, will generally have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment applied in determining fair value.\nFinancial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed based on the observability of inputs used in the determination of fair values, as follows:\nLevel I - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices available in active markets for identical instruments as of the reporting date. The type of financial instruments included in Level I include unrestricted securities, including equities and derivatives, listed in active markets. The Company does not adjust the quoted price for these instruments, even in situations where the Company holds a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price.\nLevel II - inputs to the valuation methodology are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. The type of financial instruments in this category includes less liquid and restricted securities listed in active markets, securities traded in other than active markets, government and agency securities, and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on observable inputs.\nLevel III - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to overall fair value measurement. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. Financial instruments that are included in this category include investments in privately-held entities, non-investment grade residual interests in securitizations, collateralized loan obligations, and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on unobservable inputs.\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the determination of which category within the fair value hierarchy is appropriate for any given financial instrument is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument.\nIn the absence of observable market prices, the Company values its investments using valuation methodologies applied on a consistent basis. For some investments little market activity may exist. Management's determination of fair value is then based on the best information available in the circumstances and may incorporate management's own assumptions and involves a significant degree of judgment, taking into consideration a combination of internal and external factors, including the appropriate risk adjustments for non-performance and liquidity risks. Investments for which market prices are not observable include private investments in the equity of operating companies and real estate properties, and certain debt positions. The valuation technique for each of these investments is described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe valuation methodologies can involve subjective judgments, and the fair value of assets established pursuant to such methodologies may be incorrect, which could result in the misstatement of fund performance and accrued performance allocations. Because there is significant uncertainty in the valuation of, or in the stability of the value of, illiquid investments, the fair values of such investments as reflected in an investment fund's net asset value do not necessarily reflect the prices that would be obtained by us on behalf of the investment fund when such investments are realized. Realizations at values significantly lower than the values at which investments have been reflected in prior fund net asset values would result in reduced earnings or losses for the applicable fund, the loss of potential performance allocations and incentive fees. Changes in values attributed to investments from quarter to quarter may result in volatility in the net asset values and results of operations that we report from period to period. Also, a situation where asset values turn out to be materially different than values reflected in prior fund net asset values could cause investors to lose confidence in us, which could in turn result in difficulty in raising additional funds. See Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Company - Valuation methodologies for certain assets in our funds can involve subjective judgments, and the fair value of assets established pursuant to such methodologies may be incorrect, which could result in the misstatement of fund performance and accrued performance allocations.\u201d\nPrincipal Equity-Method Investments. The Company accounts for all investments in which it has or is otherwise presumed to have significant influence, including investments in the unconsolidated funds and strategic investments, using the equity method of accounting. The carrying value of equity-method investments is determined based on amounts invested by the Company, adjusted for the equity in earnings or losses of the investee allocated based on the respective partnership or other agreement, less distributions received. The Company evaluates its equity-method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may not be recoverable.\nOur equity-method investment in NGP entitles us to 55% of the management fee-related revenue of the NGP entities that serve as advisors to the NGP Energy Funds and is subject to impairment under the U.S. GAAP accounting for equity method investments. For example, challenges with fundraising or lower future management fees could cause an impairment of our investment in NGP in the future. As of December 31, 2020, we continue to believe that our investment in NGP is not impaired.\nEquity-based Compensation. Compensation expense relating to the issuance of equity-based awards to Carlyle employees is measured at fair value on the grant date. The compensation expense for awards that vest over a future service period is recognized over the relevant service period on a straight-line basis. The compensation expense for awards that do not require future service is recognized immediately. Cash settled equity-based awards are classified as liabilities and are re-measured at the end of each reporting period. The compensation expense for awards that contain performance conditions is recognized when it is probable that the performance conditions will be achieved; in certain instances, such compensation expense may be recognized prior to the grant date of the award. The compensation expense for awards that contain market conditions is based on a grant-date fair value that factors in the probability that the market conditions will be achieved and is recognized over the requisite service period on a straight-line basis.\nThe Company recognizes equity-based award forfeitures in the period they occur as a reversal of previously recognized compensation expense.\nEquity-based awards issued to non-employees are recognized as general, administrative and other expenses, except to the extent they are recognized as a part of equity method earnings because they are issued to employees of the Company's equity method investees.\nIn determining the aggregate fair value of any award grants, we make judgments as to the grant-date fair value, particularly the discount related to awards that do not participate in distributions during the vesting period.\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill. The Company's intangible assets primarily consist of acquired contractual rights to earn future fee income, including management and advisory fees. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from four to ten years, and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the identifiable net assets of businesses acquired and is recorded in the functional currency of the acquired entity. Goodwill is recognized as an asset and is reviewed for impairment annually as of October 1 and between annual tests when events and circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nWe discuss recent accounting pronouncements in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_truncated": "Equity-based awards issued to non-employees are recognized as general, administrative and other expenses, except to the extent they are recognized as a part of equity method earnings because they are issued to employees of the Company's equity method investees.\nThe decrease in fund management fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to lower management fees from CGIOF, including $20.4 million in catch-up management fees for subsequent closes in 2019, and lower management fees from NGP X, NGP XI and NGP XII. These decreases were partially offset by higher management fees from CIEP II, including catch-up management fees of $6.6 million in 2020, activation of management fees in 2020 on our fourth Japan buyout fund ( CJP IV\u201d), and higher management fees from CETP IV.\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

This also includes $4.1 billion of fee-earning Carlyle Aviation Partners (formerly Apollo Aviation Group) assets which were acquired in a transaction that closed in December 2018.\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global Private Equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of Fee-earning AUM (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM based on capital commitments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,902 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51,274 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM based on invested capital </td> <td>30,129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,012 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,827 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM based on net asset value </td> <td>3,208 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,308 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,479 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM based on lower of cost or fair value and other </td> <td>2,297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,755 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Fee-earning AUM </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91,571 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94,811 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95,335 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted Average Management Fee Rates (2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All Funds </td> <td>1.25 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.26 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.22 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds in Investment Period </td> <td>1.37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.41 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.41 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(5) Multiple of invested capital ( MOIC\u201d) represents total fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried interest, divided by cumulative invested capital.\n\u2022fund capital expenditures;\n(3)Market Activity & Other generally represents realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments in our carry funds, related co-investment vehicles, and separately managed accounts, as well as the impact of fees, expenses and non-investment income, change in gross asset value for our business development companies and other changes in AUM.\nWe earn management fees pursuant to contractual arrangements with the investment funds that we manage and fees for transaction advisory and oversight services provided to portfolio companies of these funds. We also typically receive a performance fee from an investment fund, which may be either an incentive fee or a special residual allocation of income, which we refer to as a carried interest, in the event that specified investment returns are achieved by the fund. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d), we are required to consolidate some of the investment funds that we advise. However, for segment reporting purposes, we present revenues and expenses on a basis that deconsolidates these investment funds. Accordingly, our segment revenues primarily consist of fund management and related advisory fees and other income, realized performance revenues (consisting of incentive fees and carried interest allocations), realized principal investment income, including realized gains on our investments in our funds and other trading securities, as well as interest income. Our segment expenses primarily consist of cash compensation and benefits expenses, including salaries, bonuses, and realized performance payment arrangements, and general and administrative expenses. While our segment expenses include depreciation and interest expense, our segment expenses exclude acquisition-related charges and amortization of intangibles and impairment. Refer to Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the differences between our financial results reported pursuant to U.S. GAAP and our financial results for segment reporting purposes.\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

at December 31, 2018. This was driven by $6.3 billion of inflows primarily due to new U.S. and Europe CLO issuances, as well as additional closes in CCOF. Also driving the increase was market and other activity of $1.2 billion, the majority of which was attributable to increases in the gross asset value of our BDC's and securitization vehicles. Partially offsetting the increase were outflows of $2.4 billion primarily related to distributions in our Energy Credit and Aviation funds, as well as CLO run-off.\n(2)Outflows represents the impact of realizations from vehicles with management fees based on remaining invested capital at cost or fair value, changes in basis for funds where the investment period, weighted-average investment period or commitment fee period has expired during the period, reductions for funds that are no longer calling for fees, gross redemptions in our open-end funds, and runoff of CLO collateral balances. Distributions for funds earning management fees based on commitments during the period do not affect Fee-earning AUM.\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Carlyle\nConsolidated </td> <td> </td> <td>Adjustments(5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Total\nReportable\nSegments </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,635.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,049.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>586.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance revenues related compensation expense </td> <td>779.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(439.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>339.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net performance revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>856.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(610.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>246.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal investment income (loss) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(540.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>613.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>73.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Carlyle\nConsolidated </td> <td> </td> <td>Adjustments(5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Total\nReportable\nSegments </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>799.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(424.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>374.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance revenues related compensation expense </td> <td>436.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(226.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>210.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net performance revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>362.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(198.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>164.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal investment income (loss) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>769.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(682.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2018, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of approximately $144.1 million to common stockholders, consisting of the following:\nIn addition, we recorded incentive fees from Consolidated Funds of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Also driving the increase was $0.7 billion in foreign exchange activity related to the translation of our EUR-denominated CLOs to USD. Partially offsetting the increase were outflows of $4.2 billion primarily related to distributions in our Energy Credit and Aviation funds, as well as CLO run-off.\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee related earnings, prior year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increases (decreases): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in fee revenues </td> <td>36.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in cash-based compensation </td> <td>(17.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in general, administrative and other indirect expenses </td> <td>(0.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> All other changes </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total increase (decrease) </td> <td>19.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16.5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee related earnings, current year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nOur investment in NGP entitles us to 55% of the management fee-related revenue of the NGP entities that serve as advisors to the NGP Energy Funds and is subject to impairment under the U.S. GAAP accounting for equity method investments.

For example, challenges with fundraising or lower future management fees could cause an impairment of our investment in NGP in the future. As of December 31, 2020, we continue to believe that our investment in NGP is not impaired.\nRealized Net Performance Revenues.

Net IRR is calculated based on the timing of Limited Partner cash flows, which may differ to varying degrees from the timing of actual investment cash flows for the fund. Fund level IRRs are based on aggregate Limited Partner cash flows, and this blended return may differ from that of individual Limited Partners. As a result, certain funds may generate accrued performance revenues with a blended Net IRR that is below the preferred return hurdle for that fund. Subtotal Net IRR aggregations for multiple funds are calculated based on actual cash flow dates for each fund and represent a theoretical time-weighted return for a Limited Partner who invested sequentially in each fund.\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

When the fair value of a fund's investments remains constant or falls below certain return hurdles, previously recognized performance allocations are reversed. In all cases, each investment fund is considered separately in evaluating carried interest and potential giveback obligations. For any given period, performance allocations revenue on our statement of operations may include reversals of previously recognized performance allocations due to a decrease in the value of a particular fund that results in a decrease of cumulative performance allocations earned to date. Since fund return hurdles are cumulative, previously recognized performance allocations also may be reversed in a period of appreciation that is lower than the particular fund's hurdle rate. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the reversals of performance allocations were $401.5 million, $215.8 million and $364.4 million, respectively. Additionally, unrealized performance allocations reverse when performance allocations are realized, and unrealized performance allocations can be negative if the amount of realized performance allocations exceed total performance allocations generated in the period.\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributable earnings, prior year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>77.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increases (decreases): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in fee related earnings </td> <td>51.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24.1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in realized net performance revenues </td> <td>12.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.9) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in realized principal investment income </td> <td>6.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in net interest </td> <td>(3.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.2) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total increase (decrease) </td> <td>67.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29.1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributable earnings, current year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>116.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nof our investment to a Carlyle-affiliated investment fund (see Note 5-Investments to the consolidated financial statements) . Realized principal investment income (loss) is recorded when we redeem all or a portion of our investment or when we receive or are due cash income, such as dividends or distributions. A realized principal investment loss is also recorded when an investment is deemed to be worthless. Unrealized principal investment income (loss) results from changes in the fair value of the underlying investment, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains (losses) at the time an investment is realized.\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments in Carlyle Funds, excluding CLOs: </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global Private Equity funds(1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>676.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global Credit funds(2)\n</td> <td>671.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Solutions funds(3)\n</td> <td>57.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investments in Carlyle Funds, excluding CLOs </td> <td>1,405.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments in CLOs </td> <td>502.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other investments </td> <td>87.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investments attributable to The Carlyle Group Inc. </td> <td>1,995.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CLO loans and other borrowings attributable to The Carlyle Group Inc.

We compute earnings per common share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to the common shares of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per common share reflects the assumed conversion of all dilutive securities. We apply the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive weighted-average common shares represented by unvested restricted stock units. Prior to the Conversion, we applied the if-converted\u201d method to the Carlyle Holdings partnership units to determine the dilutive weighted-average common units outstanding.\nTotal AUM was $129.8 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $3.4 billion, or 3%, compared to $126.4 billion at December 31, 2018. This increase was driven by $10.7 billion of inflows primarily due to fundraising in CJP IV, CGP II, CETP IV, and CIEP II. Also contributing to this increase was market appreciation and other activity of $2.9 billion due to appreciation in our carry funds partially offset by the impact of management fees and expenses. The carry funds driving appreciation for the period included $0.9 billion attributable to CP VI, $0.5 billion attributable to CP VII, and $0.4 billion attributable to CAP V. Partially offsetting the increase were $9.9 billion of outflows driven primarily by distributions in our U.S. Real Estate, NGP Energy, and U.S. Buyout funds.\nUnder U.S. GAAP for income taxes, the amount of tax benefit to be recognized is the amount of benefit that is more likely than not\u201d to be sustained upon examination. The Company analyzes its tax filing positions in all of the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns, as well as for all open tax years in these jurisdictions. If, based on this analysis, the Company determines that uncertainties in tax positions exist, a liability is established, which is included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions in the provision for income taxes. If recognized, the entire amount of unrecognized tax positions would be recorded as a reduction in the provision for income taxes.\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Higher management fees from the commencement of the investment period for certain newly raised funds </td> <td>$ </td> <td>132.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>319.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lower management fees resulting from the change in basis for earning management fees from commitments to invested capital for certain funds and from changes in invested capital in funds whose management fees are based on assets under management </td> <td>(100.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(127.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Decrease) increase in catch-up management fees from subsequent closes of funds that are in the fundraising period </td> <td>(18.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Higher (lower) transaction and portfolio advisory fees </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.4) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other changes </td> <td>(5.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total increase in fund management fees </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>204.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrincipal Equity-Method Investments. The Company accounts for all investments in which it has or is otherwise presumed to have significant influence, including investments in the unconsolidated funds and strategic investments, using the equity method of accounting.

fees from our direct lending platform.\n\u2022For those entities where the Company holds a variable interest, the Company determines whether each of these entities qualifies as a VIE and, if so, whether or not the Company is the primary beneficiary. The assessment of whether the entity is a VIE is generally performed qualitatively, which requires judgment. These judgments include: (a) determining whether the equity investment at risk is sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, (b) evaluating whether the equity holders, as a group, can make decisions that have a significant effect on the economic performance of the entity, (c) determining whether two or more parties' equity interests should be aggregated, and (d) determining whether the equity investors have proportionate voting rights to their obligations to absorb losses or rights to receive returns from an entity.\n\nto 2018. The decrease in realized principal investment income for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to the recovery of $71.5 million from the final resolution of French tax litigation concerning a European real estate fund in 2019, partially offset by higher realized gains in 2020 from CP VI, CEP IV and CAP IV.\n(9) Aggregate includes Main Fund VII - Fund Investments, Main Fund VIII - Fund Investments, Main Fund IX - Fund Investments, Main Fund X - Fund Investments, Main Fund XI - Fund Investments, Main Fund IV - Mezzanine Investments, Main Fund V - Mezzanine Investments, all \u2018clean technology' private equity investments, all strategic co-investment mandates that invest in co-investment opportunities arising out of an investor's own separate private equity relationships and invitations, all strategic capital mandates, any state-focused investment mandates, and all other investors whose investments are not reflected in a Main Fund.\n(2)Outflows represents the impact of realizations from vehicles with management fees based on remaining invested capital at cost or fair value, changes in basis for funds where the investment period, weighted-average investment period or commitment fee period has expired during the period, reductions for funds that are no longer calling for fees, gross redemptions in our open-end funds, and runoff of CLO collateral balances.

Cash-based compensation and benefits expense increased $20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to increased headcount and higher cash bonuses. Cash-based compensation and benefits expense increased $44.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to the Carlyle Aviation Partners acquisition, as well as increased headcount and higher cash bonuses.\n(5)Includes funds with fees based on gross asset value.\nCorporate Treasury Investments. These investments represent investments in U.S. Treasury and government agency obligations, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, other investment grade securities and other investments with original\nAvailable Capital. Available Capital refers to the amount of capital commitments available to be called for investments, which may be reduced for equity invested that is funded via a fund credit facility and expected to be called from investors at a later date, plus any additional assets/liabilities at the fund level other than active investments. Amounts previously called may be added back to available capital following certain distributions. Expired Available Capital\u201d occurs when a fund has passed the investment and follow-on periods and can no longer invest capital into new or existing deals. Any remaining Available Capital, typically a result of either recycled distributions or specific reserves established for the follow-on period that are not drawn, can only be called for fees and expenses and is therefore removed from the Total AUM calculation.\n(1) Units issued include restricted common units and units issued and delivered in connection with our equity method investment in NGP.\nFee related earnings increased $51.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, and decreased $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. The following table provides the components of the change in fee related earnings for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019 and Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\n\nWith continued positive impact from valuations across the portfolio, net accrued performance revenues on our balance sheet increased to a record $2.3 billion at December 31, 2020, up 36% since last year. Significant IPO activity in our portfolio during 2020 has increased the portion of our traditional carry funds attributable to publicly traded companies to 15% of fair value in the fourth quarter, compared to 6% at the end of 2019. While these IPOs have performed well to date overall, this shift may result in an increasing correlation to public market performance and a significant concentration of investment gains in individual investments for certain funds. To the extent that there is volatility in public equity markets and/or the prices of our publicly-traded portfolio companies, there may be elevated volatility in our performance revenue accrual in the coming quarters.\n\u2022pay operating expenses, including compensation and compliance costs and other obligations as they arise;\n(10) Aggregate includes the following funds, as well as related co-investments, separately managed accounts (SMA's), and certain other stand-alone investments arranged by us: CSP I, CMP I, CMP II, and CASCOF.\nFor our strategic investment in Fortitude Re, the contingent cash payment relates to performance-based contingent cash consideration payable to Carlyle FRL for further payment to AIG following December 31, 2023. Based on the terms of the underlying contracts, the maximum amount that could be paid from contingent cash obligations associated with the acquisition of Carlyle Aviation Partners and the strategic investment in Fortitude Re as of December 31, 2020 is $245.0 million versus amounts recognized on the balance sheet of $145.6 million.\n\nCommon Stockholder Dividends. Our intention is to pay dividends to holders of our common stock in an amount of $0.25 per share of common stock ($1.00 per share annually), subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and compliance with applicable law. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, any dividends we pay following the Conversion generally will be treated as qualified dividend income (generally taxable to U.S. individual stockholders at capital gain rates) paid by a domestic corporation to the extent paid out of current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes, with any excess dividends treated as return of capital to the extent of the stockholder's basis. The declaration and payment of dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors, and our dividend policy may be changed at any time.\n\u2022Global Private Equity - Our Global Private Equity segment advises our 34 buyout and middle market and growth capital funds, our 10 U.S. and internationally focused real estate funds, our 14 natural resources funds, and our three Legacy Energy funds. The segment also includes three NGP Predecessor Funds and five NGP Carry Funds advised by NGP. As of December 31, 2020, our Global Private Equity segment had $131.8 billion in AUM and $91.6 billion in Fee-earning AUM.\nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information related to performance allocations for various fund types, preferred return hurdle rates, the timing of performance allocation recognition in investment income, and the potential for performance allocation income reversal.\nFor further information regarding our off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 2 and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(3) Equity-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 includes amounts presented in principal investment income and general, administrative and other expenses in our U.S. GAAP statement of operations.\nPerformance Allocation Related Compensation. A portion of the performance allocations earned is due to employees and advisers of the Company. These amounts are accounted for as compensation expense in conjunction with the recognition of the related performance allocation revenue and, until paid, are recognized as a component of the accrued compensation and benefits liability. Accordingly, upon a reversal of performance allocation revenue, the related compensation expense, if any, is also reversed.\n(h)These obligations represent commitments of the CLOs to fund certain investments. These amounts are generally due on demand and are therefore presented in the less than one year category.\nFund Performance Metrics\nEquity-based compensation. Equity-based compensation decreased $35.0 million, or 25%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019. The decrease in equity-based compensation from 2019 to 2020 was due primarily to the lower rate of ongoing grants of restricted stock units, as well as a forfeiture credit recorded in 2020 related to the retirement of one of our co-chief executive officers.\nInterest and Other Income of Consolidated Funds. Our CLOs generate interest income primarily from investments in bonds and loans inclusive of amortization of discounts and generate other income from consent and amendment fees. Substantially all interest and other income of the CLOs and other consolidated funds together with interest expense of our CLOs and net investment gains of Consolidated Funds is attributable to the related funds' limited partners or CLO investors. Accordingly, such amounts have no material impact on net income attributable to the Company.\nThe following table and discussion sets forth information regarding our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on substantially the same basis for all historical periods presented; however, the consolidated funds are not the same entities in all periods shown due to changes in U.S. GAAP, changes in fund terms and the creation and termination of funds. As further described above, the consolidation of these funds primarily had the impact of increasing interest and other income of Consolidated Funds, interest and other expenses of Consolidated Funds, and net investment gains of Consolidated Funds in the year that the fund is initially consolidated. The consolidation of these funds had no effect on net income attributable to the Company for the periods presented.\nGlobal equity markets remained strong in 2020, driven by the sharp decline in interest rates, significant increases in fiscal support, and the sense among market participants that the COVID-19 pandemic reflects a temporary decline in the supply of certain experiences and services rather than an endogenous drop in consumer demand. Over the past year, the S&P 500 rose by roughly 15%, with much larger gains in tech-heavy indexes like the Nasdaq whose constituents have tended to benefit from social distancing and remote work. The global equity markets saw a particularly strong surge from November 6 onwards after the overwhelmingly positive results of COVID-19 vaccine trials were announced. From September 30 through December 31, 2020, the S&P 500, MSCI ACWI, EuroStoxx 600, and Shanghai Composite rose 11.7%, 14.4%, 10.5%, and 7.9%, respectively. Much of this performance, particularly in the U.S., was driven by a rebound in sectors where equity prices had been hardest hit by the pandemic, such as hospitality, financials, brick-and-mortar retail, and oil & gas. In the U.S., analysts currently estimate fourth quarter earnings for companies in the S&P 500 declined 5% year-over-year, with the largest contractions still concentrated in the energy and industrials (including transportation) sectors.\nFee-earning AUM was $28.4 billion at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $0.7 billion, or 2%, compared to $29.1 billion at December 31, 2018. This decrease was driven by outflows of $4.0 billion primarily attributable to distributions in our AlpInvest funds as well as $0.4 billion of foreign exchange activity related to the translation of our AlpInvest Fee-earning AUM from EUR to USD. Partially offsetting this decrease were inflows of $3.7 billion primarily attributable to fundraising in our AlpInvest funds as well as capital deployed in our AlpInvest funds which charge fees based on invested capital.\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities. Net cash used in operating activities was primarily driven by our earnings in the respective periods after adjusting for significant non-cash activity, including non-cash performance allocations and incentive fees, the related non-cash performance allocations and incentive fee related compensation, non-cash principal investment income, non-cash equity-based compensation, and depreciation, amortization and impairments, all of which are included in earnings.\nFee-earning AUM as of and for each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2020\nA substantial majority of the remaining commitments are expected to be funded by senior Carlyle professionals, operating executives and other professionals through our internal co-investment program. Of the $3.5 billion of unfunded commitments, approximately $3.0 billion is subscribed individually by senior Carlyle professionals, operating executives and other professionals, with the balance funded directly by the Company.\n(d)We lease office space in various countries around the world and maintain our headquarters in Washington, D.C., where we have a non-cancelable lease agreement expiring on March 31, 2030. We entered into a non-cancelable lease agreement expiring in 2036 for new office space in New York City that commenced in 2020. Our office leases in other locations expire in various years through 2032. The amounts in this table represent the minimum lease payments required over the term of the lease.\n(9) Aggregate includes the following funds, as well as all active co-investments, separately managed accounts (SMA's), and stand-alone investments arranged by us: SASOF II, SASOF III, and SASOF IV.\n\n(c)the amount of aggregate fee-earning collateral balance at par of our CLOs and other securitization vehicles, as defined in the fund indentures (typically exclusive of equities and defaulted positions) as of the quarterly cut-off date;\nOur Balance Sheet\nWe will continue to comply with the risk retention rules governing CLOs issued in Europe for which we are a sponsor, which require a combination of capital from our balance sheet, commitments from senior Carlyle professionals, and/or third party financing.\n(c) the net asset value of certain carry funds; and\nGeneral, administrative and other indirect expenses. General, administrative and other indirect expenses decreased $57.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to the allocated portion of the cost recovery associated with the CCC matter of $20.3 million (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more information), lower professional fees and lower travel and entertainment expenses as a result of travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. General, administrative and other indirect expenses decreased $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to lower external costs associated with fundraising activities.\n(1) See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.\noutflows primarily include payments for operating expenses, including compensation and general, administrative, and other expenses. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, net cash provided by operating activities primarily includes the receipt of management fees and realized performance allocations and incentive fees, totaling approximately $2.1 billion, $1.9 billion, and $2.0 billion, respectively. These inflows were partially offset by payments for compensation and general, administrative, and other expenses of approximately $1.6 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\nRealized Net Performance Revenues. Realized net performance revenues increased $64.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, and decreased $147.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. Realized net performance revenues increased in 2020 as we began realizing carry from CP VI during the year, and we generated higher performance revenue realizations from our financial services and Europe real estate funds. Realized net performance revenues in 2019 were also impacted by the realized clawback on one of the Legacy Energy funds.\nThe weighted average management fee rate increased from 1.23% at December 31, 2018 to 1.26% at December 31, 2019. The increase in the weighted average management fee rate was driven by additional fundraising and fee activation in funds with higher effective fee rates than the segment weighted average. Fee-earning AUM was $94.8 billion and $95.3 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, reflecting a decrease of $0.5 billion\n(1)Inflows represents limited partner capital raised by our carry funds or separately managed accounts for which management fees based on commitments were activated during the period, the fee-earning commitments invested in vehicles for which management fees are based on invested capital, the fee-earning collateral balance of new CLO issuances, as well as gross subscriptions in our vehicles for which management fees are based on net asset value. Inflows exclude fundraising amounts during the period for which fees have not yet been activated, which are referenced as Pending Fee-earning AUM. Inflows also includes $4.1 billion of fee-earning Carlyle Aviation Partners (formerly Apollo Aviation Group) assets which were acquired in a transaction that closed in December 2018.\nFund performance information for our investment funds that generally have at least $1.0 billion in capital commitments, cumulative equity invested or total value as of December 31, 2020, which we refer to as our significant funds,\u201d\nIn many of our service contracts, we agree to indemnify the third-party service provider under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract, and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the estimate above or recorded in our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020.\nTotal AUM was $126.4 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $11.0 billion, or 9%, compared to $115.4 billion at December 31, 2017. This increase was driven by $22.6 billion of inflows primarily due to fundraising in CEP IV, CP VII, and CAP V. Also contributing to this increase was market appreciation and other activity of $3.3 billion. The carry funds driving appreciation for the period included $1.0 billion attributable to CP VI, $0.5 billion attributable to CEP IV, and $0.4 billion attributable to CP V. Partially offsetting this increase were $14.1 billion of outflows driven primarily by distributions in our U.S. Buyout, Asia Buyout and U.S. Real Estate funds.\nThe table below breaks out Fee-earning AUM by its respective components at each period.\n\n\n(9) Represents all realized proceeds combined with remaining fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried interest.\n(3)Represents the amount of aggregate Fee-earning collateral balances and principal balances, at par, for our CLOs/structured products.\nEquity-based compensation decreased $99.9 million, or 42%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. The decrease in equity-based compensation from 2018 to 2019 was due primarily to the timing of the last vesting of awards in May 2018 related to our initial public offering in 2012 and lower rate of ongoing grants of restricted stock units.\n\u2022Investment Solutions - Our Investment Solutions segment advises global private equity and real estate fund of funds programs and related co-investment and secondary activities across 283 fund vehicles. As of December 31, 2020, our Investment Solutions segment had $58.1 billion in AUM and $36.4 billion in Fee-earning AUM.\nCarlyle Common Stock and Carlyle Holdings Partnership Units\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated entities was $34.6 million, $36.6 million, and $33.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These amounts are primarily attributable to the net earnings of the Consolidated Funds for each period, which are substantially all allocated to the related funds' limited partners or CLO investors. The net income (loss) of our Consolidated Funds, after eliminations, was $8.1 million, $10.0 million, and $(5.3) million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated entities also includes net income attributable to non-controlling interests in carried interest, giveback obligations, and cash held for carried interest distributions.\nTotal AUM as of and for each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2020\nSee Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our contingent obligations (giveback).\n(3)Market Activity & Other generally represents realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments in our carry funds, related co-investment vehicles and separately managed accounts, the net impact of fees, expenses and non-investment income, as well as other changes in AUM. The fair market values for our Investment Solutions primary and secondary carry funds are based on the latest available valuations of the underlying limited partnership interests as provided by their general partners which typically has a lag of up to 90 days, plus the net cash flows since the latest valuation, up to December 31, 2020.\nInvestment Income. Investment income consists of our performance allocations as well as the realized and unrealized gains and losses resulting from our equity method investments and other principal investments.\nHistorical Liquidity and Capital Resources\nTotal AUM as of and for each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2020\nWe monitor certain operating metrics that are common to the asset management industry.\nis included throughout this discussion and analysis to facilitate an understanding of our results of operations for the periods presented. The fund return information reflected in this discussion and analysis is not indicative of the performance of The Carlyle Group Inc. and is also not necessarily indicative of the future performance of any particular fund. An investment in The Carlyle Group Inc. is not an investment in any of our funds. There can be no assurance that any of our funds or our other existing and future funds will achieve similar returns. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business Operations - The historical returns attributable to our funds, including those presented in this report, should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our funds or of our future results or of any returns expected on an investment in our common stock.\u201d\nWe may hire additional individuals and overall compensation levels may correspondingly increase, which could result in an increase in compensation and benefits expense. As a result of acquisitions, we have charges associated with contingent consideration taking the form of earn-outs and profit participation, some of which are reflected as compensation expense.\n\n\n\u2022make installment payments under the deferred obligation to former holders of Carlyle Holdings partnership units, which were exchanged in the Conversion, and;\n(g)These obligations represent amounts due to holders of debt securities issued by the consolidated CLO vehicles. These obligations include interest to be paid on debt securities issued by the consolidated CLO vehicles. Interest payments assume that no prepayments are made and loans are held until maturity. For debt securities with rights only to the residual value of the CLO and no stated interest, no interest payments were included in this calculation. Interest payments on variable-rate debt securities are based on interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2020, at spreads to market rates pursuant to the debt agreements, and range from 0.40% to 8.03%.\nConversion to a Corporation\n\n(4) Represents all realized proceeds combined with remaining fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried interest.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019 and Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\n(1)Inflows represents limited partner capital raised by our carry funds or separately managed accounts for which management fees based on commitments were activated during the period, the fee-earning commitments invested in vehicles for which management fees are based on invested capital, and gross subscriptions in open-ended vehicles with management fees based on net asset value. Inflows exclude fundraising amounts during the period for which fees have not yet been activated, which are referenced as Pending Fee-earning AUM.\n(f)the lower of cost or fair value of invested capital, generally for AlpInvest carry funds where the commitment fee period has expired and certain carry funds where the investment period has expired, (see Fee-earning AUM based on lower of cost or fair value and other\u201d in the table below for the amount of this component at each period).\n\u2022fund costs of litigation and contingencies, including related legal costs;\n\u2022repay borrowings and related interest costs and expenses;\nPerformance Allocations. Performance allocations increased $836.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 and increased $176.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. Performance allocations by segment for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 comprised the following:\nCarried interest is ultimately realized when: (1) an underlying investment is profitably disposed of, (2) certain costs borne by the limited partner investors have been reimbursed, (3) the fund's cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred return and (4) we have decided to collect carry rather than return additional capital to limited partner investors. Realized carried interest may be required to be returned by us in future periods if the fund's investment values decline below certain levels. When the fair value of a fund's investments remains constant or falls below certain return hurdles, previously recognized performance allocations are reversed.\nNet Investment Gains of Consolidated Funds. Net investment gains of Consolidated Funds measures the change in the difference in fair value between the assets and the liabilities of the Consolidated Funds. A gain (loss) indicates that the fair value of the assets of the Consolidated Funds appreciated more (less), or depreciated less (more), than the fair value of the liabilities of the Consolidated Funds. A gain or loss is not necessarily indicative of the investment performance of the Consolidated Funds and does not impact the management or incentive fees received by Carlyle for its management of the Consolidated Funds. The portion of the net investment gains (losses) of Consolidated Funds attributable to the limited partner investors is allocated to non-controlling interests. Therefore a gain or loss is not expected to have a material impact on the revenues or profitability of the Company. Moreover, although the assets of the Consolidated Funds are consolidated onto our balance sheet pursuant to U.S. GAAP, ultimately we do not have recourse to such assets and such liabilities are generally non-recourse to us. Therefore, a gain or loss from the Consolidated Funds generally does not impact the assets available to our equity holders.\nThe increase in fund management fees for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to the activation of management fees during 2018 on our seventh U.S. buyout fund ( CP VII\u201d), our fifth Asia buyout fund ( CAP V\u201d) and our fifth Europe buyout fund ( CEP V\u201d), and on our fourth Europe technology fund ( CETP IV\u201d) during the third quarter of 2019. We also had increased management fees from CGIOF, CIEP II, CPI and NGP XII, partially offset by lower management fees from CRP VII, CIEP I, CEREP III and CRP V. Management fees also increased as a result of $26.4 million in catch-up management fees for subsequent closes in 2019 for CGIOF and NGP XII. These increases were partially offset by lower fee rates and a lower basis for CP VI, CAP IV, CEP IV, and CETP III as they exited the investment period.\nOther Non-operating Expenses (Income). For the year ended December 31, 2020, this caption includes the impact of the Conversion on our tax receivable agreement liability, which was reduced by $9.3 million. See Note 11 to the consolidated\nTotal revenues decreased $442.4 million, or 13%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 and increased $949.8 million, or 39%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. The following table provides the components of the changes in total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nOur equity-method investment in NGP entitles us to 55% of the management fee-related revenue of the NGP entities that serve as advisors to the NGP Energy Funds and is subject to impairment under the U.S. GAAP accounting for equity method investments. For example, challenges with fundraising or lower future management fees could cause an impairment of our investment in NGP in the future. As of December 31, 2020, we continue to believe that our investment in NGP is not impaired.\nContingent Cash Payments For Business Acquisitions and Strategic Investments\nBond markets, while stable, shifted modestly in the fourth quarter. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose more than 25 basis points over the quarter to its highest level since March on expectations of increased government spending under the new Administration and closely divided Congress. High yield spreads tightened a further 150 basis points. Futures markets continue to expect short-term rates to remain near zero through 2025 due to the Federal Reserve's new policy framework, which appears to allow inflation to overshoot its 2% target for some time.\u201d Within corporate credit, businesses have taken advantage of low interest rates through massive debt issuance and restructurings, building large cash piles as liquidity buffers.\nThe following table presents our results of operations for our Investment Solutions segment:\n\u2022For entities that are determined to be VIEs, the Company consolidates those entities where it has concluded it is the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is defined as the variable interest holder with (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In evaluating whether the Company is the primary beneficiary, the Company evaluates its economic interests in the entity held either directly or indirectly by the Company.\n\n\n(2)Includes funds with fees based on gross asset value.\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, many observers conflated a return to the office with a return to business as usual.

Generally, we intend to have Carlyle commit to fund approximately 0.75% of the capital commitments to our future carry funds, although we may elect to invest additional amounts in funds focused on new investment areas. We may, from time to time, exercise our right to purchase additional interests in our investment funds that become\n\n(3)Represents the aggregate effective management fee rate for carry funds, weighted by each fund's Fee-earning AUM, as of the end of each period presented. Management fees for CLOs are based on the total par amount of the assets (collateral) and principal balance of the notes in the fund and are not calculated as a percentage of equity and are therefore not included.\n(4)Foreign Exchange represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated funds. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the period end.\nRepurchase Program. In December 2018, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of common stock and/or Carlyle Holdings units. In January 2020 our Board of Directors re-authorized the repurchase program with regard or common stock. This program authorizes the repurchase of shares of common stock from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid an aggregate of $26.4 million to repurchase and retire approximately 1.1 million shares with all of the repurchases done via open market brokered transactions. As of December 31, 2020, $139.1 million of repurchase capacity remained under the program. In February 2021, our Board of Directors replenished the repurchase program to its limit of $200 million of common stock.\nFee-earning AUM was $36.4 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $8.0 billion, or 28%, compared to $28.4 billion at December 31, 2019. This increase was driven by inflows of $10.7 billion primarily attributable to fundraising in our AlpInvest funds as well as capital deployed in our AlpInvest funds which charge fees based on invested capital. Foreign exchange activity related to the translation of our AlpInvest Fee-earning AUM from EUR to USD resulted in an increase in Fee-earning AUM of $1.8 billion. Partially offsetting this increase were outflows of $3.7 billion primarily attributable to distributions in our AlpInvest funds. Distributions from funds still in the commitment or weighted-average investment period do not impact Fee-earning AUM as these funds are based on commitments and not invested capital. Increases in fair value may have an impact on Fee-earning AUM for Investment Solutions as the management fees for many fully committed funds are based on fair value or on the lower of cost or fair value of the underlying investments.\nPerformance allocations consist principally of the performance-based capital allocation from fund limited partners to us, commonly referred to as carried interest, from certain of our investment funds, which we refer to as the carry funds.\u201d Carried interest revenue is recognized by Carlyle upon appreciation of the valuation of our funds' investments above certain return hurdles as set forth in each respective partnership agreement and is based on the amount that would be due to us pursuant to the fund partnership agreement at each period end as if the funds were liquidated at such date. Accordingly, the amount of carried interest recognized as performance allocations reflects our share of the fair value gains and losses of the associated\nIn addition, in our discussion of our non-GAAP results, we use the term realized net performance revenues\u201d to refer to realized performance allocations and incentive fees from our funds, net of the portion allocated to our investment professionals, if any, and certain tax expenses associated with carried interest attributable to certain partners and employees, which are reflected as realized performance allocations and incentive fees related compensation expense. See - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for the amount of realized performance revenues recognized each period. See - Segment Analysis\u201d for the realized performance revenues by segment and related discussion for each period.\nDistributable Earnings\n(8) As used herein, \u2018Main Funds' are each comprised of (i) an anchor mandate(s) (i.e., generally the largest account(s) within a strategy's investment program) and (ii) AlpInvest's other advisory client mandates with investment periods that fall within the relevant investment periods under the mandate of the anchor mandate(s) (but do not overlap with more than one such investment period). AlpInvest's commingled funds, AlpInvest Secondaries Fund VI ( ASF VI\u201d), ASF VII and AlpInvest Co-Investment Fund VII ( ACF VII\u201d) are part of the Main Funds. Mezzanine Main Funds include mezzanine investments across all strategies (i.e., Primary Funds, Secondaries, and Co-Investments).\nFund management fees include transaction and portfolio advisory fees, net of rebate offsets, of $50.8 million, $49.1 million, and $50.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n(1) Represents the original cost of investments since inception of the fund.\nThe current unfunded commitment of Carlyle and our senior Carlyle professionals, operating executives and other professionals to our investment funds as of December 31, 2020, consisted of the following:\nFee-earning AUM was $35.2 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $7.9 billion, or 29%, compared to $27.3 billion at December 31, 2017. Driving the increase were inflows of $9.2 billion primarily attributable to the acquisition of Carlyle Aviation Partners and new fee-paying capital raised in our U.S. and Europe CLO's. Partially offsetting the increase were $1.2 billion of outflows primarily related to runoff of our CLO collateral balances as well as distributions from carry funds outside the investment period.\n\nFee-earning AUM as of and for each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2020\n\n(2)Outflows represents the impact of realizations from vehicles with management fees based on remaining invested capital at cost or fair value, changes in basis for funds where the investment period, weighted-average investment period or commitment fee period has expired during the period, and reductions for funds that are no longer calling for fees. Distributions for funds earning management fees based on commitments during the period do not affect Fee-earning AUM.\n(4)Foreign Exchange represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated funds. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the period end.\n(1) Excludes our strategic equity method investment in NGP Management and investments in NGP general partners - accrued performance allocations.\n(e)These obligations generally represent commitments by us to fund a portion of the purchase price paid for each investment made by our funds. Commitments to the funds are generally due on demand and are therefore presented in the less than one year category. A substantial majority of these investments is expected to be funded by senior Carlyle professionals and other professionals through our internal co-investment program. Of the $3.5 billion of unfunded commitments to the funds, approximately $3.0 billion is subscribed individually by senior Carlyle professionals, advisors and other professionals, with the balance funded directly by the Company.\nTotal AUM was $45.7 billion as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $0.6 billion, or 1%, compared to $46.3 billion as of December 31, 2017. Driving this decrease were $9.5 billion of outflows primarily due to distributions in our AlpInvest funds and $1.7 billion of foreign exchange losses related to the translation of our AlpInvest AUM from EUR to USD. Offsetting the decrease were $4.1 billion of inflows from new commitments raised in our AlpInvest and MRE funds, and $6.5 billion of market and other activity. Market appreciation was driven by 19% appreciation in our AlpInvest funds and 8% appreciation in our MRE funds.\n\n(c)These obligations represent our estimate of amounts to be paid on the contingent cash and other obligations associated with our acquisition of Carlyle Aviation Partners (see Note 3) and other obligations, as well as the deferred payment obligations described below. In connection with the Conversion, former holders of Carlyle Holdings partnership units will receive cash payments aggregating to approximately $344 million, which is equivalent to $1.50 per Carlyle Holdings partnership unit exchanged in the Conversion, payable in five annual installments of $0.30, the first of which occurred during the first quarter of 2020. The payment obligations are unsecured obligations of the Company or a subsidiary thereof, subordinated in right of payment to indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries, and do not bear interest.\n\nInterest. Interest increased $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to interest accrued on the 3.500% Senior Notes issued in September 2019. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nThe following table presents our results of operations for our Global Credit segment:\n\u2022provide capital to facilitate our expansion into new, complementary business lines, including acquisitions;\nCash-based compensation and benefits expense. Cash-based compensation and benefits expense decreased $8.7 million, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to lower cash bonuses as a result of decreased headcount. Cash-based compensation and benefits expense increased $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to higher cash bonuses in 2019.\nExpenses\nThe Company recognizes equity-based award forfeitures in the period they occur as a reversal of previously recognized compensation expense.\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, using currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period in which the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nFund management fees exclude the reimbursement of any partnership expenses paid by the Company on behalf of the Carlyle funds pursuant to the limited partnership agreements, including amounts related to the pursuit of actual, proposed, or unconsummated investments, professional fees, expenses associated with the acquisition, holding and disposition of investments, and other fund administrative expenses.\nThe Conversion resulted in a step-up in the tax basis of certain assets that will be recovered as those assets are sold or the basis is amortized. We recorded an estimated net deferred tax asset of $262.1 million relating to this step-up in tax basis. The Conversion and subsequent exchange of Carlyle Holdings units for an equivalent number of shares of common stock of the Company also resulted in an estimated net reduction of the deferred tax asset of $388.1 million. This amount was generated by: (1) deferred tax liabilities on investments and accrued performance revenue allocations, net of related compensation, which were not previously subject to U.S. corporate income tax, (2) an increase in the historical net deferred tax assets reflecting deferred tax amounts previously allocated to private unitholders, and (3) a decrease in the historical net deferred tax assets reflecting the impact of reducing our effective state tax rate under the corporate structure. Together with the estimated step-up in tax basis, the Conversion resulted in an estimated net reduction to the Company's net deferred tax asset of $126.0 million due to the Conversion. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding the Conversion.\nThe following tables reflect the performance of our significant funds in our Investment Solutions business.\n\u2022pay income taxes, including corporate income taxes;\nAssets under Management. Assets under management or AUM\u201d refers to the assets we manage or advise. Our AUM equals the sum of the following:\n(3) To exclude the impact of FX, all foreign currency cash flows have been converted to the currency representing a majority of the capital committed to the relevant fund at the reporting period spot rate.\nfrom the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and it is reasonably possible that the difference could be material. If, at December 31, 2020, all of the investments held by the Company's funds were deemed worthless, a possibility that management views as remote, the amount of realized and distributed carried interest subject to potential giveback would be $0.5 billion, on an after-tax basis where applicable.\nTotal expenses increased $213.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, and increased $48.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. The following table provides the components of the changes in total expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTotal assets were $15.6 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $1.8 billion from December 31, 2019. The increase in total assets was primarily attributable to increases in Investments of consolidated funds of $1.0 billion due to the formation of two CLOs during the year ended December 31, 2020, partially offset by the deconsolidation of the Renewable Energy fund. The increase in total assets was also driven by a $576.5 million increase in investments, including accrued performance allocations, as well as a $157.3 million increase in our lease right-of-use assets, net resulting from the start of our lease of our new New York office space in December 2020.\nFor additional information related to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, see -Financial regulatory changes in the United States could adversely affect our business and the possibility of increased regulatory focus could result in additional burdens and expenses on our business\u201d within Item 1A.\n\u2022Global Credit - Our Global Credit segment advises a group of 71 funds that pursue investment strategies including loans and structured credit, direct lending, opportunistic credit, distressed credit, and aircraft financing and servicing. As of December 31, 2020, our Global Credit segment had $55.9 billion in AUM and $42.1 billion in Fee-earning AUM.\n(3)Market Activity & Other represents realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments in our carry funds based on the lower of cost or fair value and net asset value, as well as activity of funds with fees based on gross asset value.\n(3) Our primary and secondary investments in external funds are generally valued based on the proportionate share of the net assets provided by third party general partners of the underlying fund partnership based on the most recent available information which typically has a lag of up to 90 days. As a result, amounts presented may not include the impact of economic activity in the current quarter.\nThe table below provides the period to period rollforward of Total AUM.\n\nFund Performance Metrics\n(a) the aggregate fair value of our carry funds and related co-investment vehicles, NGP Predecessor Funds and separately managed accounts, plus the capital that Carlyle is entitled to call from investors in those funds and vehicles (including Carlyle commitments to those funds and vehicles and those of senior Carlyle professionals and employees) pursuant to the terms of their capital commitments to those funds and vehicles;\n(2) Adjusted unrealized principal investment income (loss) from the investment in Fortitude Re represents 19.9% of Fortitude Holdings' estimated net income (loss) for the respective periods through June 2, 2020, excluding the unrealized gains (losses) related to embedded derivatives.\n\nThe near-term outlook for oil and gas is expected to improve in 2021 as lockdowns are eased and fuel demand rebounds. The long-term outlook for oil and gas will be more dependent on the pace of the broader shift to alternative energy sources. For example, currently over 90% of surface, air and marine transportation is powered by oil-based fuels. While growth in electric vehicle sales should cause this share to decline over time, electric vehicles account for less than 3% of new auto sales, and less than 0.5% of the cars on the road today are fully electric. Additionally, ongoing concerns about climate change and carbon emissions may dampen investor interest in the oil and gas sector which could have a negative impact on our activities in the sector including raising capital, obtaining suitable or sufficient financing, exiting investments and achieving expected returns on new investments.\nWe include in our calculation of AUM and Fee-earning AUM certain energy and renewable resources funds that we jointly advise with Riverstone Holdings L.L.C. ( Riverstone\u201d) and the NGP Energy Funds that are advised by NGP.\n(3)Market Activity & Other generally represents realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments in our carry funds and related co-investment vehicles, the NGP Predecessor Funds and separately managed accounts, as well as the net impact of fees, expenses and non-investment income, and other changes in AUM.\nOther Contingencies\nThe following table sets forth our total segment revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nFund Management Fees. Fund management fees include management fees and transaction and portfolio advisory fees. We earn management fees for advisory services we provide to funds in which we hold a general partner interest or with which we have an investment advisory or investment management agreement. Additionally, management fees include catch-up management fees, which are episodic in nature and represent management fees charged to fund investors in subsequent closings of a fund which apply to the time period between the fee initiation date and the subsequent closing date. Approximately 90% of our fee revenue is in the form of management fees from traditional closed-end, long-dated funds, which are highly predictable and stable, and do not have significant exposure to the underlying fund valuations.\n(5) Adjustments to performance revenues and principal investment income (loss) relate to (i) unrealized performance allocations net of related compensation expense and unrealized principal investment income, which are excluded from our Non-GAAP results, (ii) amounts earned from the Consolidated Funds, which were eliminated in the U.S. GAAP consolidation but were included in the Non-GAAP results, (iii) amounts attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated entities, which were excluded from the Non-GAAP results, (iv) the reclassification of NGP performance revenues, which are included in investment income in the U.S. GAAP financial statements, (v) the reclassification of certain incentive fees from business development companies, which are included in fund management fees in the Non-GAAP results, and (vi) the reclassification of certain tax expenses associated with performance revenues. Adjustments to principal investment income (loss) also include the reclassification of earnings for the investment in NGP Management and its affiliates to the appropriate operating captions for the Non-GAAP results, and the exclusion of charges associated with the investment in NGP Management and its affiliates that are excluded from the Non-GAAP results (see Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements).\nThe table below details Fee-earning AUM by its respective components at each period.\nFee Revenues. Total fee revenues increased $36.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 and increased $72.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, due to the following:\n(2)Outflows represents the impact of realizations from vehicles with management fees based on remaining invested capital at cost or fair value, changes in basis for funds where the investment period, weighted-average investment period or commitment fee period has expired during the period, reductions for funds that are no longer calling for fees, and gross redemptions in open-ended vehicles with management fees based on net asset value. Realizations for funds earning management fees based on commitments during the period do not affect Fee-earning AUM.\nNon-controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities. Non-controlling interests in consolidated entities represent the component of equity in consolidated entities not held by us. These interests are adjusted for general partner allocations.\n\n(b)the remaining amount of limited partner invested capital at cost, generally for carry funds and certain co-investment vehicles where the original investment period has expired, Metropolitan carry funds after the expiration of the weighted-average investment period of the underlying funds, and one of our business development companies (see Fee-earning AUM based on invested capital\u201d in the table below for the amount of this component at each period);\n(4)Foreign Exchange represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated funds. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the period end.\nFee Related Earnings\nThe following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 on a consolidated basis and on a basis excluding the obligations of the Consolidated Funds:\n\nWe have historically required limited capital resources to support the working capital and operating needs of our business. Our management fees have largely covered our operating costs and all realized performance allocations, after covering the related compensation, are available for distribution to equityholders. Approximately 95% - 97% of all capital commitments to our funds have been provided by our fund investors, with the remaining amount typically funded by our senior Carlyle professionals, advisors and other professionals.\nSince our inception through December 31, 2020, we and our senior Carlyle professionals, operating executives and other professionals have invested or committed to invest in or alongside our funds. Approximately 3% to 5% of all capital commitments to our funds are funded collectively by us and our senior Carlyle professionals, operating executives and other professionals.\n(13) For purposes of aggregation, funds that report in foreign currency have been converted to U.S. dollars at the reporting period spot rate.\n\nThe table below provides the period to period rollforward of Total AUM.\nIn the absence of observable market prices, the Company values its investments using valuation methodologies applied on a consistent basis. For some investments little market activity may exist. Management's determination of fair value is then based on the best information available in the circumstances and may incorporate management's own assumptions and involves a significant degree of judgment, taking into consideration a combination of internal and external factors, including the appropriate risk adjustments for non-performance and liquidity risks. Investments for which market prices are not observable include private investments in the equity of operating companies and real estate properties, and certain debt positions. The valuation technique for each of these investments is described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\nThe table below provides the period to period rollforward of Fee-earning AUM.\nFee-earning AUM was $91.6 billion at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $3.2 billion, or 3%, compared to $94.8 billion at December 31, 2019. This was driven by outflows of $9.5 billion which were principally a result of dispositions in our U.S. Buyout, NGP Energy, and Legacy Energy funds, as well as distributions in other funds outside of their investment period. Partially offsetting this were inflows of $5.4 billion primarily related to the activation of management fees in CJP IV, subscriptions in CPI, and new fee-paying commitments raised in various other funds. Also offsetting the decrease was positive foreign exchange activity of $1.2 billion from the translation of our Europe buyout, growth, and real estate AUM from EUR to USD. Investment and distribution activity by funds still in the investment period does not impact Fee-earning AUM as these funds are based on commitments.\nDecember 31, 2020 at their then current fair values. These assets and liabilities will continue to fluctuate in accordance with the fair values of the fund investments until they are realized. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $10.6 million of the accrued giveback obligation is the responsibility of various current and former senior Carlyle professionals and other limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships, and the net accrued giveback obligation attributable to Carlyle Holdings is $8.1 million. The Company uses net accrued performance revenues\u201d to refer to the aggregation of the accrued performance allocations and incentive fees net of (i) accrued giveback obligations, (ii) accrued performance allocations and incentive fee-related compensation, (iii) performance allocations and incentive fee-related tax obligations, and (iv) accrued performance allocations and incentive fees attributable to non-controlling interests and excludes any net accrued performance allocations and incentive fees that have been realized but will be collected in subsequent periods. The net accrued performance revenues as of December 31, 2020 are $2.3 billion.\nIn the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by federal and certain state, local and foreign tax regulators. As of December 31, 2020, our U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2016 through 2019 are open under the normal three-year statute of limitations and therefore subject to examination. State and local tax returns are generally subject to audit from 2014 to 2019. Foreign tax returns are generally subject to audit from 2011 to 2019. Certain of our affiliates are currently under audit by federal, state and foreign tax authorities.\n\nDistributable earnings increased $67.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, and decreased $29.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. The following table provides the components of the changes in distributable earnings for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n(3) Represents remaining fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried interest, and may include remaining escrow values for realized investments.\nOn January 1, 2020, we completed our conversion from a Delaware limited partnership named The Carlyle Group L.P. into a Delaware corporation named The Carlyle Group Inc. Pursuant to the Conversion, at the specified effective time on January 1, 2020, each common unit of The Carlyle Group L.P. outstanding immediately prior to the effective time converted into one share of common stock of The Carlyle Group Inc. and each special voting unit and general partner unit was canceled for no consideration. In addition, holders of the partnership units in Carlyle Holdings I L.P., Carlyle Holdings II L.P., and Carlyle Holdings III L.P. exchanged such units for an equivalent number of shares of common stock and certain other restructuring steps occurred (the conversion, together with such restructuring steps and related transactions, the Conversion\u201d).\n\nOur key financial measures are discussed in the following pages. Additional information regarding these key financial measures and our other significant accounting policies can be found in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFee related earnings decreased $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, and increased $143.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. The following table provides the components of the change in fee related earnings for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nThe funding for employee obligations and givebacks related to carry realized pre-IPO is primarily through a collection of employee receivables related to giveback obligations and from non-controlling interests for their portion of the obligation. The realization of giveback obligations for the Company's portion of such obligations reduces Distributable Earnings in the period realized. Further, each individual recipient of realized carried interest typically signs a guarantee agreement or partnership agreement that personally obligates such person to return his/her pro rata share of any amounts of realized carried interest previously distributed that are later clawed back. Accordingly, carried interest as performance allocation compensation is subject to return to the Company in the event a giveback obligation is funded. Generally, the actual giveback liability, if any, does not become due until the end of a fund's life.\nPerformance allocations in excess of 10% of the total for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were generated from the following funds:\nThe decrease in transaction fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 resulted primarily from transaction fees related to investments in CP VII, CIEP and CJP III in 2019, partially offset by transaction fees related to investments in CGFSP II, CGFSP III and CIEP II in 2020. The decrease in transaction fees for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 resulted primarily from transaction fees related to significant investments in CP VII and one significant investment in CAP IV in 2018, partially offset by transaction fees in CIEP and CJP III in 2019.\n\nThe valuation methodologies can involve subjective judgments, and the fair value of assets established pursuant to such methodologies may be incorrect, which could result in the misstatement of fund performance and accrued performance allocations. Because there is significant uncertainty in the valuation of, or in the stability of the value of, illiquid investments, the fair values of such investments as reflected in an investment fund's net asset value do not necessarily reflect the prices that would be obtained by us on behalf of the investment fund when such investments are realized. Realizations at values significantly lower than the values at which investments have been reflected in prior fund net asset values would result in reduced earnings or losses for the applicable fund, the loss of potential performance allocations and incentive fees. Changes in values attributed to investments from quarter to quarter may result in volatility in the net asset values and results of operations that we report from period to period. Also, a situation where asset values turn out to be materially different than values reflected in prior fund net asset values could cause investors to lose confidence in us, which could in turn result in difficulty in raising additional funds. See Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Company - Valuation methodologies for certain assets in our funds can involve subjective judgments, and the fair value of assets established pursuant to such methodologies may be incorrect, which could result in the misstatement of fund performance and accrued performance allocations.\u201d\nEntities that do not qualify as VIEs are generally assessed for consolidation as voting interest entities. Under the voting interest entity model, the Company consolidates those entities it controls through a majority voting interest.\nFair Value Measurement. U.S. GAAP establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework which ranks the observability of market price inputs used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. The observability of inputs is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, the characteristics specific to the financial instrument and the state of the marketplace, including the existence and transparency of transactions between market participants. Financial instruments with readily available quoted prices, or for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in active markets, will generally have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment applied in determining fair value.\nof the pandemic, our employees have proven what they can accomplish while they are working remotely, and they remain well connected and engaged with each other and our stakeholders through our suite of teleconferencing and virtual meeting solutions. While we have generally reopened our offices around the globe, most employees continue to work remotely and we continue to successfully operate our business and address the needs of our shareholders, fund investors and portfolio companies.\n\nOur Liquidity Needs\nThe net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 also reflects the investment activity of our Consolidated Funds. For the year ended December 31, 2020, proceeds from the sales and settlements of investments by the Consolidated Funds were $2.0 billion, while purchases of investments by the Consolidated Funds were $3.1 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2019, proceeds from the sales and settlements of investments by the Consolidated Funds were $2.1 billion, while purchases of investments by the Consolidated Funds were $2.2 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2018, proceeds from the sales and settlements of investments by the Consolidated Funds were $2.7 billion, while purchases of investments by the Consolidated Funds were $3.7 billion.\nThe table below breaks out Fee-earning AUM by its respective components during the period.\n(3)Market Activity & Other represents realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments in our carry funds based on the lower of cost or fair value and net asset value.\nThe table below breaks out Fee-earning AUM by its respective components at each period.\n\nFee Related Earnings\nOur calculations of AUM and Fee-earning AUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers. As a result, these measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. In addition, our calculation of AUM (but not Fee-earning AUM) includes uncalled commitments to, and the fair value of invested capital in, our investment funds from Carlyle and our personnel, regardless of whether such commitments or invested capital are subject to management fees or performance allocations. Our calculations of AUM or Fee-earning AUM are not based on any definition of AUM or Fee-earning AUM that is set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds that we manage or advise.\nTotal Compensation and Benefits. Total compensation and benefits increased $323.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, and increased $47.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, due to the following:\nPromissory Notes. In June 2017, as part of the settlement with investors in two commodities investment vehicles managed by an affiliate of the Company (discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements), the Company issued a series of promissory notes, aggregating to $53.9 million, to the investors of these commodities investment vehicles. Interest on these promissory notes accrued at the three month LIBOR plus 2%. These promissory notes matured on July 15, 2019 and were fully repaid as of that date.\n(13) \"Main Fund\" entries represent a combination of a commingled fund and SMA vehicles which together comprise a \"program\" vintage. Indented lines shown for AlpInvest Secondaries Funds VII, VI and AlpInvest Co-Investment Fund VII reflect a breakout of the commingled fund, which is part of the larger program vintage.\n(6)Energy III, Energy IV, and Renew II (collectively, the Legacy Energy Funds\u201d) are managed with Riverstone Holdings LLC and its affiliates. Affiliates of both Carlyle and Riverstone act as investment advisers to each of the Legacy Energy Funds. Carlyle has a minority representation on the management committees of Energy IV and Renew II. Carlyle and Riverstone each hold half of the seats on the management committees of Energy III, but the investment period for this fund has expired and the remaining investments in such fund are being disposed of in the ordinary course of business.\nThe table below provides the period to period rollforward of Total AUM.\nWe recognize as compensation expense the portion of performance allocations and incentive fees that are due to our employees, senior Carlyle professionals, advisors, and operating executives in a manner consistent with how we recognize the performance allocations and incentive fee revenue. These amounts are accounted for as compensation expense in conjunction with the related performance allocations and incentive fee revenue and, until paid, are recognized as a component of the accrued compensation and benefits liability. Compensation in respect of performance allocations and incentive fees is paid when the related performance allocations and incentive fees are realized, and not when such performance allocations and incentive fees\n(a)The table above assumes that no prepayments are made on the senior notes. The CLO terms loans are included in the table above based on the earlier of the stated maturity date or the date the CLO is expected to be dissolved. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for the various maturity dates of the CLO term loans and senior notes.\nThe table below summarizes the valuation of investments and other financial instruments included within our AUM, by segment and fair value hierarchy levels, as of December 31, 2020:\n(3) The Company's primary and secondary investments in external funds are generally valued based on its proportionate share of the net assets provided by the third party general partners of the underlying fund partnerships based on the most recent available information which typically has a lag of up to 90 days. As a result, amounts presented may not include the impact of economic activity in the current quarter.\nFundraising has remained generally resilient since the onset of the pandemic. Though we were not fundraising any of our flagship funds in Global Private Equity during 2020, we raised $27.5 billion in new capital in 2020, well exceeding our goal for the year, with particular fundraising strength in Investment Solutions and Global Credit.\n(15) Aggregate includes the following funds, as well as related co-investments, separately managed accounts (SMA's), and certain other stand-alone investments arranged by us: CRP I, CRP II, CRP III, CRCP I, CAREP I, CAREP II, CEREP I, and CEREP II.\n(7) Net Internal Rate of Return ( Net IRR\u201d) represents an annualized time-weighted return on Limited Partner invested capital, based on contributions, distributions and unrealized fair value as of the reporting date, after the impact of all management fees, partnership expenses and carried interest, including current accruals. Net IRR is calculated based on the timing of Limited Partner cash flows, which may differ to varying degrees from the timing of actual investment cash flows for the fund. Fund level IRRs are based on aggregate Limited Partner cash flows, and this blended return may differ from that of individual Limited Partners. As a result, certain funds may generate accrued performance revenues with a blended Net IRR that is below the preferred return hurdle for that fund. Subtotal Net IRR aggregations for multiple funds are calculated based on actual cash flow dates for each fund and represent a theoretical time-weighted return for a Limited Partner who invested sequentially in each fund.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, accrued performance allocations and accrued giveback obligations were approximately $5.0 billion and $18.7 million, respectively. Each balance assumes a hypothetical liquidation of the funds' investments at\nGeneral, Administrative and Other Expenses. General, administrative, and other expenses include occupancy and equipment expenses and other expenses, which consist principally of professional fees, including those related to our global regulatory compliance program, external costs of fundraising, travel and related expenses, communications and information services, depreciation and amortization (including intangible asset amortization and impairment) and foreign currency transactions. We expect that general, administrative and other expenses will vary due to infrequently occurring or unusual items, such as impairment of intangible assets and expenses or insurance recoveries associated with litigation and contingencies. Also, in periods of significant fundraising, to the extent that we use third parties to assist in our fundraising efforts, our general, administrative and other expenses may increase accordingly. Additionally, we anticipate that general, administrative and other expenses will fluctuate from period to period due to the impact of foreign exchange.\n(6) Gross Internal Rate of Return ( Gross IRR\u201d) represents the annualized IRR for the period indicated on Limited Partner invested capital based on investment contributions, distributions and unrealized value of the underlying funds, before management fees, expenses and carried interest at the AlpInvest/Metropolitan Real Estate level.\nThe Conversion qualified for the non-recognition of gain or loss to our former common unitholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The application of the non-recognition rules to non-U.S. common unitholders in the context of the Conversion is dependent on local tax requirements. Following the Conversion, dividends are reported to stockholders on Form 1099-DIV and are treated as qualified dividend income (generally taxable to U.S. individual stockholders at capital gain rates) paid by a domestic corporation to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes, with any excess dividends treated as return of capital to the extent of the stockholder's basis.\n\nRealized Net Performance Revenues. Realized net performance revenues increased $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, and decreased $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. Substantially all of the realized net performance revenues were generated from AlpInvest carry fund vehicles for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Performance revenues from our Investment Solutions segment pay a higher ratio of performance revenues as compensation, primarily as a result of the terms of our acquisition of AlpInvest. Under our arrangements with the historical owners and management team of AlpInvest, we generally do not retain any carried interest with respect to the historical investments and commitments to our AlpInvest fund vehicles that existed as of July 1, 2011 (including any options to increase any such commitments exercised after such date). We are entitled to 15% of the carried interest with respect to commitments from the historical owners of AlpInvest for the period between 2011 and 2020, except in certain instances, and 40% of the carried interest in respect of all other commitments (including all future commitments from third parties). As funds that have launched since our acquisition of AlpInvest in 2011 begin to realize performance revenues, an increasing share of net realized performance revenues will be for our benefit.\n(4) Of the $356.1 million in total CLO term loans outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and as disclosed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, $336.5 million are collateralized by investments attributable to The Carlyle Group Inc.\nInterest and other income of consolidated funds increased $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, and decreased $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. Substantially all of the variance in interest and other income of Consolidated Funds for both periods relates to interest income from CLOs.\nRevenues primarily consist of fund management fees, incentive fees, investment income (including performance allocations, realized and unrealized gains of our investments in our funds and other principal investments), as well as interest and other income.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019 and Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nDiscussed below is our DE and FRE for our segments for the periods presented. Our segment information is reflected in the manner used by our senior management to make operating and compensation decisions, assess performance and allocate resources.\navailable in the ordinary course of their operations. We expect our senior Carlyle professionals and employees to continue to make significant capital contributions to our funds based on their existing commitments, and to make capital commitments to future funds consistent with the level of their historical commitments. We also intend to make investments in our open-end funds and our CLO vehicles. Our investments in our European CLO vehicles will comply with the risk retention rules as discussed in Risk Retention Rules\u201d later in this section.\n(14) Aggregate includes the following funds, as well as all active co-investments, separately managed accounts (SMA's), and stand-alone investments arranged by us: CCR and CER.\nHistorically, we have conducted our operations through four reportable segments: Corporate Private Equity, Real Assets, Global Credit, and Investment Solutions. In the fourth quarter of 2020, in connection with our transition to a sole chief executive officer on October 1, 2020, our senior management began re-evaluating our operating structure. As a result, we revised our operating segments by combining Corporate Private Equity and Real Assets into a single segment called Global Private Equity to reflect how senior management manages and assesses the performance of the business and allocates resources. Effective with the three months ended December 31, 2020, we have modified the presentation of our segment financial information to reflect this change, with retrospective application to all prior periods presented. Consequently, information for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 will be different from the historical segment financial results we previously reported in our reports filed with the SEC. There was no impact to the Global Credit and Investment Solutions segments as a result of this change.\nFee-earning AUM is presented below for each period together with the components of change during each respective period.\n5.650% Senior Notes. In September 2018, Carlyle Finance L.L.C. issued $350.0 million of 5.650% senior notes due September 15, 2048 at 99.914% of par.\nFee-earning AUM was $29.1 billion at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $1.1 billion, or 4%, compared to $30.2 billion at December 31, 2017. This decrease was driven by outflows of $5.0 billion primarily attributable to distributions in our AlpInvest funds as well as $1.1 billion of foreign exchange activity related to the translation of our AlpInvest Fee-earning AUM from EUR to USD. Partially offsetting this decrease were inflows of $5.1 billion primarily attributable to fundraising in our AlpInvest and MRE funds.\nDistributable Earnings\nIn addition, realized performance allocations may be reversed in future periods to the extent that such amounts become subject to a giveback obligation. If at December 31, 2020, all investments held by our carry funds were deemed worthless, a possibility that management views as remote, the amount of realized and previously distributed performance allocations subject to potential giveback would be approximately $0.5 billion, on an after-tax basis where applicable. See the related discussion of Contingent Obligations (Giveback)\u201d within - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nFee-earning AUM is presented below for each period together with the components of change during each respective period.\n(1)Inflows represents limited partner capital raised by our carry funds or separately managed accounts for which management fees based on commitments were activated during the period and the fee-earning commitments invested in\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe generally use Fee-earning AUM as a metric to measure changes in the assets from which we earn recurring management fees. Total AUM tends to be a better measure of our investment and fundraising performance as it reflects investments at fair value plus available capital.\n(4) Multiple of invested capital ( MOIC\u201d) represents total fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried interest, divided by cumulative invested capital.\n(1) The Company's primary and secondary investments in external funds are generally valued based on its proportionate share of the net assets provided by the third party general partners of the underlying fund partnerships based on the most recent available information which typically has a lag of up to 90 days. As a result, amounts presented may not include the impact of economic activity in the current quarter.\nGenerally, the investment period of our funds enables us to be patient in deploying capital only in investments that meet our return criteria and the strategic objectives of our funds. During the fourth quarter, our carry funds invested $8.7 billion in new or follow-on transactions and we invested $18.3 billion for the full year 2020. We anticipate that increased market activity and opportunities for large buyouts will facilitate strong deployment activity as we move further into 2021. We also expect volume to remain robust across both growth and buyout opportunities, particularly in the healthcare, technology, and consumer sectors. However, challenges in specific industries could lead to a longer-term slowdown in certain sectors, such as traditional energy.\nFor purposes of presenting our results of operations for this segment, our earnings from our investments in NGP are presented in the respective operating captions. The following table presents our results of operations for our Global Private Equity segment:\nFee related earnings increased $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, and decreased $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. The following table provides the components of the change in fee related earnings for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n(1)Inflows reflects the impact of gross fundraising during the period. For funds or vehicles denominated in foreign currencies, this reflects translation at the average quarterly rate, while the separately reported Fundraising metric is translated at the spot rate for each individual closing.\n(6) Gross Internal Rate of Return ( Gross IRR\u201d) represents an annualized time-weighted return on Limited Partner invested capital, based on contributions, distributions and unrealized fair value as of the reporting date, before the impact of management fees, partnership expenses and carried interest. For fund vintages 2017 and after, Gross IRR includes the impact of interest expense related to the funding of investments on fund lines of credit. Gross IRR is calculated based on the timing of Limited Partner cash flows, which may differ to varying degrees from the timing of actual investment cash flows for the fund. Subtotal Gross IRR aggregations for multiple funds are calculated based on actual cash flow dates for each fund and represent a theoretical time-weighted return for a Limited Partner who invested sequentially in each fund.\nLevel II - inputs to the valuation methodology are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. The type of financial instruments in this category includes less liquid and restricted securities listed in active markets, securities traded in other than active markets, government and agency securities, and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on observable inputs.\n(2)Outflows includes distributions net of recallable or recyclable amounts in our carry funds, related co-investment vehicles, and separately managed accounts, gross redemptions in our open-end funds, runoff of CLO collateral balances, and the expiration of available capital.\nCompensation and Benefits. Compensation includes salaries, bonuses, equity-based compensation, and performance payment arrangements. Bonuses are accrued over the service period to which they relate.\nThe following tables set forth information in the format used by management when making resource deployment decisions and in assessing performance of our segments. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Our Non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effects of unrealized performance allocations net of related compensation expense, unrealized principal investment income, consolidated funds, acquisition-related items including amortization and any impairment charges of acquired intangible assets and contingent consideration taking the form of earn-outs, charges associated with equity-based compensation, changes in the tax receivable agreement liability, corporate actions and infrequently occurring or unusual events.\n(11) Aggregate includes the following funds, as well as related co-investments, separately managed accounts (SMA's), and certain other stand-alone investments arranged by us: CP I, CP II, CP III, CP IV, CEP I, CAP I, CAP II, CBPF I, CJP I, CMG, CVP I, CUSGF III, CGFSP I, CEVP I, CETP I, CETP II, CAVP I, CAVP II, CAGP III and Mexico.\n(1) The Company's primary and secondary investments in external funds are generally valued based on its proportionate share of the net assets provided by the third party general partners of the underlying fund partnerships based on the most recent available information which typically has a lag of up to 90 days. As a result, amounts presented may not include the impact of economic activity in the current quarter.\nDistributable Earnings for our reportable segments is as follows:\nTotal AUM was $58.1 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of $12.9 billion, or 29%, compared to $45.2 billion as of December 31, 2019. Driving this increase were $13.9 billion of inflows principally from new commitments raised in our AlpInvest secondaries and coinvestment programs, $3.6 billion of market and other activity, and $3.2 billion of foreign exchange gains related to the translation of our AlpInvest AUM from EUR to USD. Offsetting the increase were $7.7 billion of outflows primarily due to distributions in our AlpInvest funds.\nLevel III - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to overall fair value measurement. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. Financial instruments that are included in this category include investments in privately-held entities, non-investment grade residual interests in securitizations, collateralized loan obligations, and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on unobservable inputs.\nThe significant captions and amounts from our consolidated statements of cash flows which include the effects of our Consolidated Funds and CLOs in accordance with U.S. GAAP are summarized below.\n(5) An investment is considered realized when the investment fund has completely exited, and ceases to own an interest in, the investment. An investment is considered partially realized when the total amount of proceeds received in respect of such investment, including dividends, interest or other distributions and/or return of capital, represents at least 85% of invested capital and such investment is not yet fully realized. Because part of our value creation strategy involves pursuing best exit alternatives, we believe information regarding Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and Gross IRR, when considered together with the other investment performance metrics presented, provides investors with meaningful information regarding our investment performance by removing the impact of investments where significant realization activity has not yet occurred. Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and Gross IRR have limitations as measures of investment performance, and should not be considered in isolation. Such limitations include the fact that these measures do not include the performance of earlier stage and other investments that do not satisfy the criteria provided above. The exclusion of such investments will have a positive impact on Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and Gross IRR in instances when the MOIC and Gross IRR in respect of such investments are less than the aggregate MOIC and Gross IRR. Our measurements of Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and Gross IRR may not be comparable to those of other companies that use similarly titled measures.\nSegment Analysis\n(2) Includes $3.6 million of net accrued clawback from our Legacy Energy funds.\nTotal AUM as of and for each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2020\n\nCash-based compensation and benefits. Cash-based compensation and benefits increased $16.2 million, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, and increased $86.7 million, or 14%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to the following:\n(18) Aggregate includes the following funds, as well as related co-investments, separately managed accounts (SMA's), and certain other stand-alone investments arranged by us: CIP.\nThe net income attributable to The Carlyle Group Inc. common stockholders was $348.2 million, $345.3 million, and $92.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Prior to the Conversion, the Company was allocated a portion of the monthly net income (loss) attributable to Carlyle Holdings based on the Company's ownership in Carlyle Holdings (which was approximately 34% and 32% as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively). Net income or loss attributable to the Company also included 100% of the net income or loss attributable to the Company's wholly owned taxable subsidiary, Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc., which was $(4.5) million and $15.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As a result, prior to the Conversion, the total net income or loss attributable to the Company has varied as a percentage of the net income or loss attributable to Carlyle Holdings. In addition, net income attributable to The Carlyle Group L.P. common unitholders for the year ended December 31, 2019 was reduced by the Series A preferred units ( Preferred Units\u201d) redemption premium. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded approximately $86 million as a provision for income taxes as a result of a reduction in our net deferred tax asset related to the Conversion. Excluding this impact from Conversion, our effective income tax rate would have been approximately 19%.\nGlobal Private Equity\nFee Related Earnings. Fee Related Earnings, or FRE\u201d, is a component of DE and is used to assess the ability of the business to cover direct base compensation and operating expenses from total fee revenues. FRE differs from income (loss) before provision for income taxes computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP in that it adjusts for the items included in the calculation of DE and also adjusts DE to exclude net realized performance revenues, realized principal investment income from investments in Carlyle funds, net interest (interest income less interest expense), and certain general, administrative and other expenses when the timing of any future payment is uncertain.\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into various off-balance sheet arrangements including sponsoring and owning limited or general partner interests in consolidated and non-consolidated funds, entering into derivative transactions, and entering into guarantee arrangements. We also have ongoing capital commitment arrangements with certain of our consolidated and non-consolidated funds. We do not have any other off-balance sheet arrangements that would require us to fund losses or guarantee target returns to investors in any of our other investment funds.\n(4) Multiple of invested capital ( MOIC\u201d) represents total fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried interest, divided by cumulative invested capital.\nOn January 1, 2020, we completed our conversion from a Delaware limited partnership named The Carlyle Group L.P. (the Partnership\u201d) into a Delaware corporation named The Carlyle Group Inc. (the Corporation\u201d). Pursuant to the Conversion, at the specified effective time on January 1, 2020, (i) each common unit of the Partnership outstanding immediately prior to the effective time converted into one issued and outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, (ii) each special voting unit of the Partnership outstanding immediately prior to the effective time was canceled for no consideration and the former holder(s) thereof ceased to have any rights with respect thereto and (iii) each general partner unit of the Partnership outstanding immediately prior to the effective time was canceled for no consideration and the former holder(s) thereof ceased to have any rights with respect thereto, in each case without any action required on the part of the Partnership, the Corporation, any holder of any Partnership interest or any other person. In addition, holders of partnership units in Carlyle Holdings I L.P., Carlyle Holdings II L.P. and Carlyle Holdings III L.P. exchanged such units for an equivalent number of shares of common stock of the Corporation and certain other restructuring steps occurred (the conversion, together with such restructuring steps and related transactions, the Conversion\u201d).\nGeneral, administrative and other indirect expenses increased $48.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to $31.5 million of insurance proceeds related to commodities received in 2018 as well as increases related to our acquisition of Carlyle Aviation Partners in December 2018.\nDistributable Earnings differs from income (loss) before provision for income taxes computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP in that it includes certain tax expenses associated with performance revenues (comprised of performance allocations and incentive fees), and does not include unrealized performance allocations and related compensation expense, unrealized principal investment income, equity-based compensation expense, net income (loss) attributable to non-Carlyle interest in consolidated entities, or charges (credits) related to Carlyle corporate actions and non-recurring items. Charges (credits) related to Carlyle corporate actions and non-recurring items include: charges associated with acquisitions or strategic investments, changes in the tax receivable agreement liability, corporate conversion costs, amortization and any impairment charges associated with acquired intangible assets, transaction costs associated with acquisitions and dispositions, charges associated with earnouts and contingent consideration including gains and losses associated with the estimated fair value of contingent consideration issued in conjunction with acquisitions or strategic investments, impairment charges associated with lease right-of-use assets, gains and losses from the retirement of debt, charges associated with contract terminations and employee severance. We believe the inclusion or exclusion of these items provides investors with a meaningful indication of our core operating performance. This measure supplements and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the results of operations discussed further under -Consolidated Results of Operations\u201d prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nKey Financial Measures\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n(2) Represents the original cost of investments since inception of the fund.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nWe conduct our operations through three operating segments: Global Private Equity, Global Credit, and Investment Solutions.\nUnless the context suggests otherwise, references in this report to Carlyle,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d and our\u201d refer (i) prior to the consummation of the Conversion to The Carlyle Group L.P. and its consolidated subsidiaries and (ii) from and after the consummation of the Conversion to The Carlyle Group Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. References to our common stock in periods prior to the Conversion refer to the common units of The Carlyle Group L.P.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAfter deducting cash amounts allocated to the specific requirements mentioned above, the remaining cash and cash equivalents is approximately $880 million as of December 31, 2020. This remaining amount will be used towards our primary liquidity needs, as outlined in the next section. This amount does not take into consideration ordinary course of business payables and reserves for specific business purposes.\nThe table below provides the period to period rollforward of Fee-earning AUM.\nTotal AUM was $131.8 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $2.0 billion, or 2%, compared to $129.8 billion at December 31, 2019. This increase was driven by $3.6 billion of inflows primarily due to fundraising in CPI, CIEP II, and CJP IV. Also contributing to this increase was market appreciation of $6.4 billion. The carry funds driving appreciation for the period included $6.1 billion attributable to CP VI, $1.3 billion attributable to CAP IV, and $0.8 billion attributable to CP VII, offset by $(1.0) billion attributable to NGP XI and $(0.5) billion attributable to CIEP. The increase of $1.6 billion in foreign exchange activity was primarily from the translation of our Europe buyout, growth, and real estate AUM from EUR to USD. Partially offsetting the increase were $9.6 billion of outflows driven primarily by distributions in our U.S. Buyout, Asia Buyout and U.S. Real Estate funds.\n(3)Market Activity & Other represents realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments in funds or vehicles based on the lower of cost or fair value or net asset value, as well as activity of funds with fees based on gross asset value.\nThe weighted average management fee rate decreased slightly from 1.26% at December 31, 2019 to 1.25% at December 31, 2020. Fee-earning AUM was $91.6 billion and $94.8 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, reflecting a decrease of $3.2 billion.\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the determination of which category within the fair value hierarchy is appropriate for any given financial instrument is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument.\nThe Carlyle Group Inc. common stock repurchased during the period presented in the tables above relate to shares repurchased during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and subsequently retired as part of our stock repurchase programs.\n(3)Market Activity & Other generally represents realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments in our carry funds and related co-investment vehicles, the NGP Predecessor Funds and separately managed accounts, as well as the net impact of fees, expenses and non-investment income, change in gross asset value for our business development companies and other changes in AUM.\nPortfolio Appreciation (Depreciation). The overall portfolio appreciation of 10% in 2020 is comprised of 19% appreciation for carry funds within our Global Private Equity segment focusing on corporate private equity, 8% for funds focusing on real estate and (16)% for fund focusing on natural resources, (2)% appreciation for carry funds in the Global Credit segment and 10% for carry funds in the Investment Solutions segment. While there is no perfectly comparable market index benchmark for the overall portfolio or any of its segments or strategies, we would note that S&P 500 and MSCI ACWI appreciation for the year were 16% and 14%, respectively, while the FTSE NAREIT Composite appreciation was (10)%, the S&P Oil and Gas Exploration & Production Index was (38)%, and S&P Leveraged Loan Index appreciation was 3%.\n(1)For additional information concerning the components of Fee-earning AUM, see -Fee-earning Assets under Management.\u201d\nNet Cash Used In Investing Activities. Our investing activities generally reflect cash used for acquisitions and fixed assets and software for internal use. Purchases of fixed assets were $61.2 million, $27.8 million and $31.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in investing activities principally reflects the acquisition of Carlyle Aviation Partners.\nDistributable earnings increased $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, and increased $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. The following table provides the components of the changes in distributable earnings for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\nLevel I - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices available in active markets for identical instruments as of the reporting date. The type of financial instruments included in Level I include unrestricted securities, including equities and derivatives, listed in active markets. The Company does not adjust the quoted price for these instruments, even in situations where the Company holds a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price.\nOf particular note are risks to the outlook for the transportation industry where recovery in metrics such as discretionary air travel and public transit ridership lags other macro indicators, and the infrastructure sector, where the pandemic has materially altered revenue expectations and has led to severe projected budget shortfalls at the state and local level. The potential for a sustained period of severely depressed commercial air travel may have significant implications not only for the airlines, but also for the myriad aviation related companies such as aircraft suppliers, their vendors and airport services firms that depend on the aviation industry for a substantial portion of their revenues.\nInterest and Other Expenses of Consolidated Funds. The interest and other expenses of Consolidated Funds consist primarily of interest expenses related primarily to our CLO loans, professional fees and other third-party expenses.\nSee Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information related to our material guarantees.\nCash-based compensation and benefits expense increased $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to an increase in headcount and 2019 cash bonuses.\nThe following table summarizes the total amount of aggregate giveback obligations that we have realized since Carlyle's inception. Given various current and former senior Carlyle professionals and other limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships are responsible for paying the majority of the realized giveback obligation, the table below also summarizes the amount that was attributable to Carlyle:\n(11) For purposes of aggregation, funds that report in foreign currency have been converted to U.S. dollars at the reporting period spot rate.\nCash used to purchase investments as well as the proceeds from the sale of such investments are reflected in our cash flows from operating activities as this investment activity is a normal part of our operations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, investment proceeds were $307.5 million while investment purchases were $350.9 million, including $79.6 million related to a purchase price adjustment on our strategic investment in Fortitude Re. During the year ended December 31, 2019, investment proceeds were $389.2 million while investment purchases were $312.4 million. Investment proceeds in 2019 also included $71.5 million received from the resolution of French tax litigation. During the year ended December 31, 2018, investment proceeds were $893.4 million while investment purchases were $867.4 million, which included cash outflows of $393.8 million related to our investment in Fortitude Re.\nGeneral, administrative and other indirect expenses. General, administrative and other indirect expenses increased $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to increased professional fees, partially offset by the allocated portion of the cost recovery associated with the CCC matter of $3.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020 (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.) and lower travel and entertainment expenses as a result of travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nGeneral, Administrative and Other Expenses. General, administrative and other expenses decreased $145.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, and increased $33.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to:\n\nFund Management Fees. Fund management fees increased $9.8 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, and increased $204.2 million, or 16%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to the following:\n(b) the amount of aggregate collateral balance and principal cash at par or aggregate principal amount of the notes of our CLOs and other structured products (inclusive of all positions);\nRealized net performance revenues were primarily generated by the following funds for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively:\nCash-based compensation and benefits expense. Cash-based compensation and benefits expense increased $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to an increase in 2020 cash bonuses.\nOur performance allocations are generated by a diverse set of funds with different vintages, geographic concentration, investment strategies and industry specialties. For an explanation of the fund acronyms used throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section, see Item 1. Business - Our Family of Funds.\u201d\nThe assets and liabilities of the Consolidated Funds are generally held within separate legal entities and, as a result, the assets of the Consolidated Funds are not available to meet our liquidity requirements and similarly the liabilities of the Consolidated Funds are non-recourse to us. For example, as previously discussed, the CLO term loans generally are secured by the Company's investment in the CLO, have a general unsecured interest in the Carlyle entity that manages the CLO, and do not have recourse to any other Carlyle entity.\n\nOur carry fund portfolio continued to build on the strong momentum started in the second half of the year, appreciating 8% in the fourth quarter and 10% for the year. Within our Global Private Equity segment, our corporate private equity funds appreciated by 11% in the fourth quarter and 19% over the last twelve months, reflecting strong performance across the portfolio and our real estate funds appreciated by 3% during the fourth quarter and 8% over the last twelve months. Our natural resources funds appreciated by 3% in the fourth quarter despite continued pressure, with depreciation of 16% over the last twelve months. In our Global Credit segment, our carry funds (which represent approximately 14% of the total Global Credit remaining fair value) appreciated by 7% in the fourth quarter, as tightening spreads led to an increase in value for many of our positions, and depreciated 2% over the last twelve months. Investment Solutions appreciation was 7% in the fourth quarter and 10% for the year, though the valuations of our primary and secondary funds of funds generally reflect investment fair values on a one-quarter lag.\nCertain of our global private equity funds have entered into lines of credit secured by their investors' unpaid capital commitments or by a pledge of the equity of the underlying investment. These lines of credit are used primarily to reduce the overall number of capital calls to investors or for working capital needs. In certain instances, however, they may be used for other investment related activities, including serving as bridge financing for investments. The degree of leverage employed varies among portfolio companies.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nInvestment Solutions\nWe are closely evaluating the financial and other proposals put forth by the new Administration and Congress and their potential impacts on our business. While there may be changes to current tax and regulatory regimes, additional fiscal stimulus packages could be followed by longer-term spending increases on infrastructure, climate, health care and education. The potential for policy changes may create regulatory uncertainty for our portfolio companies and our investment strategies and adversely affect the profitability of our portfolio companies.\nIn the future, we expect that our primary liquidity needs will be to:\nFor most of our carry funds, total AUM includes the fair value of the capital invested, whereas Fee-earning AUM includes the amount of capital commitments or the remaining amount of invested capital, depending on whether the original investment period for the fund has expired. As such, Fee-earning AUM may be greater than total AUM when the aggregate fair value of the remaining investments is less than the cost of those investments.\nInvestment income also represents the unrealized and realized gains and losses on our principal investments, including our investments in Carlyle funds that are not consolidated, as well as any interest and other income. Investment income (loss) also includes the related amortization of the basis difference between the carrying value of our investment and our share of the underlying net assets of the investee, as well as the compensation expense associated with compensatory arrangements provided by us to employees of our equity method investee, as it relates to our investments in NGP. Principal investment income also included our proportionate share of U.S. GAAP earnings from our strategic investment in Fortitude Re prior to the contribution\n(12) For funds marked NM,\u201d IRR may be positive or negative, but is not considered meaningful because of the limited time since initial investment and early stage of capital deployment. For funds marked Neg,\u201d IRR is considered meaningful but is negative as of reporting period end.\nIncentive Fees. Incentive fees consist of performance-based incentive arrangements pursuant to management contracts, primarily from certain of our Global Credit funds, when the return on assets under management exceeds certain benchmark returns or other performance targets. In such arrangements, incentive fees are recognized when the performance benchmark has been achieved.\n(7) Represents the net accrued performance fee balance/(giveback obligation) as of the current quarter end.\nExpenses\nThe increase in fund management fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily driven by increased management fees from our structured credit funds, opportunistic credit carry fund, direct lending platform, Carlyle FRL and Carlyle Aviation Partners, partially offset by lower management fees from our energy mezzanine carry funds.\nRealized Principal Investment Income. Realized principal investment income increased $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 and increased $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. The increase in realized principal investment income for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to realized losses in one of our energy mezzanine funds in 2019 and higher realized gains on investments in our business development companies. The increase in realized principal investment income for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to higher dividends from our Interval Fund in 2019.\nThe increase in portfolio advisory and transaction fees, net, and other fees for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 as compared to the respective periods resulted primarily from increased underwriting fees related to Carlyle Global Capital Markets.\nFee-earning AUM was $37.9 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $2.7 billion, or 8%, compared to $35.2 billion at December 31, 2018. Driving the increase were inflows of $4.4 billion primarily attributable to new fee-paying capital raised in our U.S. and Europe CLO's and follow-on closes in CCOF, as well as $1.1 billion of market and other activity primarily related to increases in gross asset value in our BDCs and securitization vehicles. Partially offsetting the increase were $2.7 billion of outflows primarily related to a fee basis step-down in CEMOF II and runoff of our CLO collateral balances.\nInvestments as of December 31, 2020 consist of the following:\nWe have multiple sources of liquidity to meet our capital needs, including cash on hand, annual cash flows, accumulated earnings and funds from our senior revolving credit facility, which has $775.0 million of available capacity as of December 31, 2020. We believe these sources will be sufficient to fund our capital needs for at least the next twelve months.\n(4)Foreign Exchange represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated funds. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the period end.\nThe CLOs incur interest expense on their loans payable and incur other expenses consisting of trustee fees, rating agency fees and professional fees. Substantially all interest and other income of our CLOs together with interest expense of our CLOs and net investment gains of Consolidated Funds is attributable to the related funds' limited partners or CLO investors. Accordingly, such amounts have no material impact on net income attributable to the Company.\n(2)Reflects limited partner invested capital at cost and includes amounts committed to or reserved for investments for certain Global Private Equity and Investment Solutions funds.\n(2) Represents all realized proceeds since inception of the fund.\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill. The Company's intangible assets primarily consist of acquired contractual rights to earn future fee income, including management and advisory fees. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from four to ten years, and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.\n(1) Adjustments to unrealized principal investment income (loss) during the year ended December 31, 2020 are inclusive of $211.8 million of unrealized gains resulting from changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives related to certain reinsurance contracts included in Fortitude Re's U.S. GAAP financial statements prior to the contribution of our investment in Fortitude Holdings to Carlyle FRL on June 2, 2020. At the time of the contribution of our investment to Carlyle FRL, we began accounting for our investment under the equity method based on our net asset value in the fund, which is an investment company that accounts for its investment in Fortitude Holdings at fair value. This resulted in an unrealized loss in principal investment income (loss) of $620.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Adjustments to unrealized principal investment income (loss) during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are inclusive of $582.0 million and $46.2 million of unrealized gains, respectively, on embedded derivatives.\nNet Investment Gains (Losses) of Consolidated Funds\n\nRevenues\nCLO Borrowings. For certain of our CLOs, the Company finances a portion of its investment in the CLOs through the proceeds received from term loans with financial institutions. The Company's outstanding CLO term loans were $356.1 million and $324.9 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The CLO term loans are secured by the Company's investments in the respective CLO, have a general unsecured interest in the Carlyle entity that manages the CLO, and generally do not have recourse to any other Carlyle entity. As of December 31, 2020, $336.5 million of these loans are secured by investments attributable to The Carlyle Group Inc. See Note 7 of our financial statements for more information on our CLO term loans.\n(1)Inflows reflects the impact of gross fundraising during the period. For funds or vehicles denominated in foreign currencies, this reflects translation at the average quarterly rate, while the separately reported Fundraising metric is translated at the spot rate for each individual closing. Inflows also includes $5.8 billion of Carlyle Aviation Partners (formerly Apollo Aviation Group) assets which were acquired in a transaction that closed in December 2018.\nIn addition, we have implemented various equity-based compensation arrangements that require senior Carlyle professionals and other employees to vest ownership of a portion of their equity interests over a service period of generally six months to four years, which under U.S. GAAP will result in compensation charges over current and future periods. Over the past two years, we have granted fewer equity awards to employees than we have previously. For example, in 2018, 2019 and 2020, we granted approximately 13.3 million, 6.7 million and 3.5 million of restricted stock units and other awards, respectively. In February 2021, we granted 6.6 million long-term strategic restricted stock units to certain senior professionals, the majority of which are subject to vesting based on the achievement of annual performance targets over four years. As a result, the number of restricted stock units granted in 2021 will be higher than in 2020, which, combined with a higher share price than in prior periods, will result in higher equity-based compensation expense in the coming years. Compensation charges associated with all equity-based compensation grants are excluded from Fee Related Earnings and Distributable Earnings.\nSenior Revolving Credit Facility. On February 11, 2019, the Company entered into an amendment and restatement of its senior revolving credit facility. The capacity under the revolving credit facility is $775.0 million and is scheduled to mature on February 11, 2024. Principal amounts outstanding under the amended and restated revolving credit facility accrue interest, at the option of the borrowers, either (a) at an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin not to exceed 0.50% per annum, or (b) at LIBOR plus an applicable margin not to exceed 1.50% per annum (1.40% at December 31, 2020).\nThe table below provides the period to period rollforward of Total AUM.\n(7) Net Internal Rate of Return ( Net IRR\u201d) represents the annualized IRR for the period indicated on Limited Partner invested capital based on contributions, distributions and unrealized value after management fees, expenses and carried interest. Fund level IRRs are based on aggregate Limited Partner cash flows, and this blended return may differ from that of individual Limited Partners. As a result, certain funds may generate accrued performance revenues with a blended Net IRR that is below the preferred return hurdle for that fund.\nare accrued. The funds do not have a uniform allocation of performance allocations and incentive fees to our employees, senior Carlyle professionals and operating executives. Therefore, for any given period, the ratio of performance allocations and incentive fee compensation to performance allocations and incentive fee revenue may vary based on the funds generating the performance allocations and incentive fee revenue for that period and their particular allocation percentages.\n(3) Represents remaining fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried interest, and may include remaining escrow values for realized investments.\n(1)Reflects limited partner capital commitments where the original investment period, weighted-average investment period, or commitment fee period has not expired.\nThe total shares as of December 31, 2020 as shown above exclude approximately 1.3 million shares of common stock in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units subsequent to December 31, 2020 that will participate in the common stockholder dividend that will be paid.\nAggregate economic activity continued to improve through the fourth quarter of 2020, and overall revenue growth among public companies was roughly flat, on average, for the year. However, the pandemic's sharply discrepant impact has increased the dispersion in performance across businesses and industries. During 2020, more than 10% of public companies reported a peak-to-trough fall in revenues of more than 50%, roughly twice the number of businesses reporting losses of this magnitude over any 12-month period during 2008-2009. On the other hand, over 5% of businesses also reported revenue gains in excess of 50%, as remote work and social distancing led businesses to make greater use of video communications technology and households substituted video streaming and durable goods purchases for travel, tourism and live events spending.\nFee Related Earnings\n(5) Gross Internal Rate of Return ( Gross IRR\u201d) represents an annualized time-weighted return on Limited Partner invested capital, based on contributions, distributions and unrealized fair value as of the reporting date, before the impact of management fees, partnership expenses and carried interest. For fund vintages 2017 and after, Gross IRR includes the impact of interest expense related to the funding of investments on fund lines of credit. Gross IRR is calculated based on the timing of Limited Partner cash flows, which may differ to varying degrees from the timing of actual investment cash flows for the fund. Subtotal Gross IRR aggregations for multiple funds are calculated based on actual cash flow dates for each fund and represent a theoretical time-weighted return for a Limited Partner who invested sequentially in each fund.\n(1)For additional information concerning the components of Fee-earning AUM, see -Fee-earning Assets under Management.\u201d\nRefer to - Segment Analysis\u201d for a detailed discussion by segment of the activity affecting Fee-earning AUM for each of the periods presented by segment.\n(e)the gross assets (including assets acquired with leverage), excluding cash and cash equivalents, of one of our business development companies and certain carry funds (see Fee-earning AUM based on lower of cost or fair value and other\u201d in the table below for the amount of this component at each period); and\n(2)Represents the aggregate effective management fee rate of each fund in the segment, weighted by each fund's Fee-earning AUM, as of the end of each period presented.\nPrior to the Control Transaction which closed on June 2, 2020, as described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, we accounted for our investment in Fortitude Re under the equity method of accounting by recognizing our pro rata share of Fortitude Holdings' U.S. GAAP earnings, which is included in principal investment income (loss) in the consolidated statements of operations. These amounts were inclusive of unrealized gains (losses) resulting from changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives related to certain reinsurance contracts included in Fortitude Re's U.S. GAAP financial statements. Modified coinsurance is subject to the general accounting principles for hedging, specifically the guidance originally issued as Derivatives Implementation Group Issue No. B36: Embedded Derivatives: Modified Coinsurance Agreements and Debt Instruments That Incorporate Credit Risk Exposures That Are Unrelated or Only Partially Related to the Creditworthiness of the Obligor under Those Instruments ( DIG B36\u201d). As of December 31, 2019, our investment in Fortitude Holdings was $1,200.9 million, which reflected $628.2 million of cumulative unrealized gains related to the change in the fair value of embedded derivatives.\n(2) Includes the Company's investment in Fortitude Re, which was contributed to Carlyle FRL, a Carlyle-affiliated investment fund, in June 2020 as discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.\nFee-earning AUM as of and for each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2020\nThe increase in portfolio advisory and transaction fees, net, and other fees for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 as compared to the respective periods resulted primarily from transaction fees associated with Carlyle FRL in 2020 (see Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for more information) and increased underwriting fees related to Carlyle Global Capital Markets.\nCash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents were approximately $987.6 million at December 31, 2020. However, a portion of this cash is allocated for specific business purposes, including, but not limited to, (i) performance allocations and incentive fee-related cash that has been received but not yet distributed as performance allocations and incentive fee related compensation and amounts owed to non-controlling interests; (ii) proceeds received from realized investments that are allocable to non-controlling interests; and (iii) regulatory capital.\n(8) For funds marked NM,\u201d IRR may be positive or negative, but is not considered meaningful because of the limited time since initial investment and early stage of capital deployment. For funds marked Neg,\u201d IRR is considered meaningful but is negative as of reporting period end.\nAt the time we contributed our existing 19.9% interest in Fortitude Holdings to Carlyle FRL, a Carlyle-affiliated investment fund, we began accounting for our investment under the equity method based on our net asset value in the fund. Our investment in Carlyle FRL, which is an investment company, reflects our investment in Fortitude Holdings at fair value. Although the fair value reflected a 10% appreciation over our cost, this resulted in a loss in principal investment income (loss) of $620.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, our investment in Carlyle FRL was $554.4 million, relative to our cost of $465.4 million.\nOur balance sheet without the effect of the Consolidated Funds can be seen in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. At December 31, 2020, our total assets were $9.5 billion, including cash and cash equivalents totaling $987.6 million and net accrued performance revenues of $2.3 billion.\nThe following table reflects the performance of certain funds in our Global Credit business. These tables separately present funds that, as of the periods presented, had at least $1.0 billion in capital commitments, cumulative equity invested or total equity value. See Business - Our Family of Funds\u201d for a legend of the fund acronyms listed below.\n\u2022pay dividends to our common stockholders in accordance with our dividend policy;\n(1) Includes private equity and mezzanine primary fund investments, secondary fund investments and co-investments originated by the AlpInvest team, as well as real estate primary fund investments, secondary fund investments and co-investments originated by the Metropolitan Real Estate team. Excluded from the performance information shown are a) investments that were not originated by AlpInvest, b) Direct Investments, which was spun off from AlpInvest in 2005, and c) LP co-investment vehicles advised by AlpInvest. As of December 31, 2020, these excluded investments represent $1.5 billion of AUM at AlpInvest.\nThe table below provides the period to period rollforward of Fee-earning AUM.\nPerformance allocations and incentive fee related compensation expense. Performance allocations and incentive fee related compensation expense increased $342.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 and increased $60.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. Performance allocations and incentive fee related compensation expense as a percentage of performance allocations and incentive fee was 47%, 52%, and 58% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Performance allocations and incentive fee related compensation as a percentage of performance allocations and incentive fees fluctuates depending on the mix of funds contributing to performance allocations and incentive fees in a given period. For our largest segment, Global Private Equity, our performance allocations and incentive fee related compensation expense as a percentage of performance allocations is generally around 45%. Performance allocations from our Investment Solutions segment pay a higher ratio of performance allocations as compensation, primarily as a result of the terms of our acquisition of AlpInvest. Conversely, performance allocations from the Legacy Energy and NGP funds in our Global Private Equity segment are primarily allocated to Carlyle because the investment teams for the Legacy Energy and NGP funds are employed by Riverstone and NGP, respectively, and not Carlyle.\n(d) the gross assets (including assets acquired with leverage) of our business development companies, plus the capital that Carlyle is entitled to call from investors in those vehicles pursuant to the terms of their capital commitments to those vehicles.\nFund performance information for certain of our Global Credit Funds is included throughout this discussion and analysis to facilitate an understanding of our results of operations for the periods presented. The fund return information reflected in this discussion and analysis is not indicative of the performance of The Carlyle Group Inc. and is also not necessarily indicative of the future performance of any particular fund. An investment in The Carlyle Group Inc. is not an investment in any of our funds. There can be no assurance that any of our funds or our other existing and future funds will achieve similar returns. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business Operations - The historical returns attributable to our funds including those presented in this report should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our funds or of our future results or of any returns expected on an investment in our common stock.\u201d\n(12) Represents the net accrued performance fee balance/(giveback obligation) as of the current quarter end.\nFee Revenues. Total fee revenues increased $36.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to increased management fees from our private equity fund vehicles driven by the activation of management fees on our latest secondaries fund and higher catch-up management fees on our real estate fund-of-fund vehicles.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are a party to litigation, investigations, inquiries, employment-related matters, disputes and other potential claims. We discuss certain of these matters in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur accrued performance allocations by segment as of December 31, 2020, gross and net of accrued giveback obligations, are set forth below:\nIn addition to the performance allocations from our Global Private Equity funds and most of our closed-end carry funds in the Global Credit segment, we are also entitled to receive performance allocations from our Investment Solutions, Carlyle Aviation and NGP Carry Funds. The timing of performance allocations realizations for these funds is typically later than in our other carry funds based on the terms of such arrangements.\nTotal AUM was $45.2 billion as of December 31, 2019, a decrease of $0.5 billion, or 1%, compared to $45.7 billion as of December 31, 2018. Driving this decrease were $7.9 billion of outflows primarily due to distributions in our AlpInvest funds and $0.5 billion of foreign exchange losses related to the translation of our AlpInvest AUM from EUR to USD. Offsetting the decrease were $3.0 billion of inflows from new commitments raised in our AlpInvest and MRE funds, and $5.0 billion of market and other activity. Market appreciation was driven by 15% appreciation in our AlpInvest funds and 3% appreciation in our MRE funds.\nThe Carlyle Group Inc. common stock issued during the period presented in the tables above relate to the vesting of the Company's restricted stock units and shares issued and delivered in connection with our equity method investment in NGP during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nContractual Obligations\nRefer to - Key Financial Measures\u201d for a listing of the funds with performance allocations in excess of 10% of the total for the periods presented.\nTransaction and Portfolio Advisory Fees. Transaction and portfolio advisory fees are fees we receive for the transaction and portfolio advisory services we provide to our portfolio companies. When covered by separate contractual agreements, we recognize transaction and portfolio advisory fees when the service has been provided and collection is reasonably assured. We are required to offset our fund management fees earned by a percentage of the transaction and advisory fees earned, which we refer to as the rebate offsets.\u201d Historically, such rebate offset percentages generally approximated 80% of the fund's portion of the transaction and advisory fees earned. However, the percentage of transaction and portfolio advisory fees we share with our investors on our recent vintage funds has generally increased from 80% to 100% of the fund's portion of the transaction and portfolio advisory fees earned, such that a larger share of the transaction fee revenue we retain is driven by co-investment activity. In addition, GCM generates capital markets fees in connection with activities related to the underwriting, issuance and placement of debt and equity securities, and loan syndication for our portfolio companies and third-party clients, which are generally not subject to rebate offsets with respect to our most recent vintages (but are subject to the rebate offsets set forth above for older funds). Underwriting fees include gains, losses and fees arising from securities offerings in which we participate in the underwriter syndicate. The recognition of transaction fees, portfolio advisory fees, and capital markets fees can be volatile as they are primarily generated by investment activity within our funds, and therefore are impacted by our investment pace.\n(2)Outflows includes distributions net of recallable or recyclable amounts in our carry funds, related co-investment vehicles, separately managed accounts and the NGP Predecessor Funds, gross redemptions in our open-ended funds, and the expiration of available capital.\nThe increase in realized principal investment income for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily relates to the aforementioned $71.5 million French tax matter recovery, which reversed a portion of an investment loss recognized in 2015 (see Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements for more information on this matter), partially offset by realized losses in 2019 from CP VI and CEP IV compared to realized gains in 2018 from CP VI, CEP III and CAP IV.\n\u2022repurchase our common stock.\nOur Sources of Liquidity\n(d)the external investor portion of the net asset value of certain carry funds (see Fee-earning AUM based on net asset value\u201d in the table below for the amount of this component at each period);\n(1)Inflows reflects the impact of gross fundraising during the period.

Inflows also includes $5.8 billion of Carlyle Aviation Partners (formerly Apollo Aviation Group) assets which were acquired in a transaction that closed in December 2018.\nInvestment Income. Investment income decreased $473.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, and increased $759.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to the following:\nIn 2020, our Board of Directors has declared cumulative dividends to common stockholders totaling approximately $352.6 million, or $1.00 per common share, consisting of the following:\n(4)Foreign Exchange represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated funds. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the period end.\nIncome before provision for income taxes is the GAAP financial measure most comparable to Distributable Earnings and Fee Related Earnings. The following table is a reconciliation of income before provision for income taxes to Distributable Earnings and to Fee Related Earnings.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities. In 2020, we received net proceeds of $294.1 million from borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, and repaid $329.9 million, and paid $68.8 million in January 2020 for the first installment of the deferred consideration payable to former Carlyle Holdings unitholders in connection with the Conversion. We also paid $26.4 million to repurchase and retire 1.1 million shares of common stock. In 2019, we received net proceeds of $420.6 million from the issuance of $425.0 million of 3.500% senior notes, and $41.0 million from the issuance of various CLO borrowings, paid $405.4 million to repurchase our outstanding Preferred Units, paid $34.5 million to repurchase 1.6 million units under our repurchase program and paid off a $25.0 million term loan. In 2018, we received net proceeds of $345.7 million from the issuance of $350.0 million of 5.650% senior notes, paid $255.1 million to repurchase $250.0 million of 3.875% senior notes, and paid $108.8 million to prepay the remaining balance outstanding under a promissory note to BNRI.\n(2)Outflows includes distributions in our carry funds, related co-investment vehicles and separately managed accounts, as well as the expiration of available capital.\n(f)In connection with our initial public offering, we entered into a tax receivable agreement with the limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships whereby we agreed to pay such limited partners 85% of the amount of cash tax savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax realized as a result of increases in tax basis resulting from exchanges of Carlyle Holdings partnership units for common units of The Carlyle Group L.P. From and after the consummation of the Conversion, holders of Carlyle Holdings partnership units do not have any rights to payments under the tax receivable agreement except for payment obligations pre-existing at the time of the Conversion with respect to exchanges that occurred prior to the Conversion. These obligations are more than offset by the future cash tax savings that we are expected to realize.\nThe following tables reflect the performance of our significant funds in our Global Private Equity business. See Item 1. Business - Our Family of Funds\u201d for a legend of the fund acronyms listed below.\nInterest and Other Income of Consolidated Funds. Interest and other income of Consolidated Funds primarily represents the interest earned on CLO assets. The Consolidated Funds are not the same entities in all periods presented. The Consolidated Funds in future periods may change due to changes in fund terms, formation of new funds, and terminations of funds.\nFee-earning Assets under Management. Fee-earning assets under management or Fee-earning AUM refers to the assets we manage or advise from which we derive recurring fund management fees. Our Fee-earning AUM is generally based on one of the following, once fees have been activated:\nWhile unexpected resilience in goods consumption, residential real estate markets, and business spending have led to better than expected 2020 global growth outcomes, and the recently enacted and proposed fiscal stimulus measures should help bolster household income, significant risks remain for 2021. In December 2020, total U.S. employment declined for the first time since April after seven consecutive months of gains. The slower than anticipated global vaccination rollout, combined with uncertainties regarding new variants of the virus, will prolong the risk of continued disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic deeper into the year. In Europe, the ongoing re-imposition of broad-based lockdown measures could stymie growth in the near-term, while underlying labor market fragility and debt accumulation pose a potential risk to the longer-term growth outlook for the region. Direct state aid programs have artificially suppressed unemployment rates to date and 5% or more of the workforce is still supported by employment retention programs in some European economies. While many of these policies have been extended through 2021, an eventual labor market shakeout remains a possibility.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019 and Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018.\nfinancial statements for more information on the tax impacts of the Conversion. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, this caption also represents the change in the fair value of contingent consideration associated with the Company's acquisitions.\nWe discuss recent accounting pronouncements in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nDistributable Earnings\nSenior Notes. Certain indirect finance subsidiaries of the Company have issued senior notes, on which interest is payable semi-annually, as discussed below. The senior notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the respective subsidiary and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Company and each of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships. The indentures governing each of the senior notes contain customary covenants that, among other things, limit the issuers' and the guarantors' ability, subject to certain exceptions, to incur indebtedness secured by liens on voting stock or profit participating equity interests of their subsidiaries or merge, consolidate or sell, transfer or lease assets. The notes also contain customary events of default. All or a portion of the notes may be redeemed at our option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, prior to their stated maturity, at the make-whole redemption price set forth in the notes. If a change of control repurchase event occurs, the notes are subject to repurchase at the repurchase price as set forth in the notes.\nTotal fee revenues decreased $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to decreased management fees from our private equity fund vehicles and lower catch-up management fees on our real estate fund-of-fund vehicles. In addition, realizations outpaced new fundraising, leading to lower Fee-earning AUM.\nFinancial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed based on the observability of inputs used in the determination of fair values, as follows:\n\nIncome Taxes. Following the Conversion on January 1, 2020, all of the income before provision for income taxes attributable to The Carlyle Group Inc. is subject to U.S. federal, state, and local corporate income taxes. Prior to the Conversion, the Carlyle Holdings partnerships and their subsidiaries primarily operated as pass-through entities for U.S. income tax purposes and recorded a provision for state and local income taxes for certain entities based on applicable laws and a provision for foreign income taxes for certain foreign entities. In addition, Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc. was subject to U.S. income taxes on only a portion of our income or loss. As such, the Company was not responsible for the tax liability due on certain income earned during the year. Such income was taxed at the unitholder and non-controlling interest holder level, and any income tax was the responsibility of the unitholders and was paid at that level. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the impact of the Conversion.\n\nGlobal Credit Revolving Credit Facility. In December 2018, certain subsidiaries of the Company established a $250.0 million revolving line of credit, primarily intended to support certain lending activities within the Global Credit segment. The credit facility includes a $125.0 million line of credit with a one-year team, which was amended in December 2020 to extend its maturity to December 2021, and a $125.0 million line of credit with a three-year term. Principal amounts outstanding under the facility accrue interest, at the option of the borrowers, either (a) at an alternate base rate plus applicable margin not to exceed 1.00%, or (b) at the Eurocurrency rate plus an applicable margin not to exceed 2.00%. As of December 31, 2020, there was no outstanding balance under this facility.\nGlobal equity markets remained strong in 2020, driven by the sharp decline in interest rates, significant increases in fiscal support, and the sense among market participants that the COVID-19 pandemic reflects a temporary decline in the supply of certain experiences and services rather than an endogenous drop in consumer demand. Our carry fund portfolio generally exhibited similar resiliency amidst the significant economic and market disruptions in 2020, with particular momentum in the latter half of the year. Within our Global Private Equity segment, our corporate private equity funds appreciated by 11% in the fourth quarter and 19% over the last twelve months and our real estate funds appreciated by 3% during the fourth quarter and appreciated 8% over the last twelve months. Our natural resources funds appreciated by 3% during the fourth quarter, but depreciated by 16% over the last twelve months, as our energy funds continue to recover from extreme volatility in the early stages of the pandemic. Global Credit carry funds, which represent approximately 14% of the total Global Credit remaining fair value, were up 7% in the fourth quarter, with depreciation of 2% for the year. Investment Solutions appreciation was 7% in the fourth quarter and 10% for the year, driven by strong investment performance in our AlpInvest funds, though the valuations of our primary and secondary funds of funds generally reflect investment values on a one-quarter lag. Though significant risks remain for global markets and economic recovery into 2021, we believe our existing portfolio of assets is high-quality and well-diversified by fund, industry sector, asset class, and region.\nFee-earning AUM was $42.1 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $4.2 billion, or 11%, compared to $37.9 billion at December 31, 2019. Driving the increase were inflows of $6.4 billion primarily attributable to new fee-paying capital raised in our U.S. and Europe CLOs, fee-paying third-party capital raised in our insurance business, and investment activity in CCOF, as well as $1.2 billion in foreign exchange activity related to the translation of our EUR-denominated CLOs to USD. Partially offsetting the increase were $3.9 billion of outflows primarily related to a fee basis step-down in CEMOF II and runoff of our CLO collateral balances. Distributions from carry funds still in the investment period do not impact Fee-earning AUM as these funds are based on commitments and not invested capital.\nfunds' underlying investments measured at their then-current fair values relative to the fair values as of the end of the prior period. As a result, the performance allocations earned in an applicable reporting period are not indicative of any future period, as fair values are based on conditions prevalent as of the reporting date. Refer to - Trends Affecting our Business\u201d for further discussion.\nChanges to these judgments could result in a change in the consolidation conclusion for a legal entity.\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the identifiable net assets of businesses acquired and is recorded in the functional currency of the acquired entity. Goodwill is recognized as an asset and is reviewed for impairment annually as of October 1 and between annual tests when events and circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred.\nPerformance Allocations. Performance allocations consist principally of the allocation of profits from certain of the funds to which the Company is entitled (commonly known as carried interest). The Company is generally entitled to a 20% allocation (which can vary by fund) of the net realized income or gain as a carried interest after returning the invested capital, the allocation of preferred returns and return of certain fund costs (generally subject to catch-up provisions as set forth in the fund limited partnership agreement). Carried interest is ultimately realized when: (i) an underlying investment is profitably disposed of, (ii) certain costs borne by the limited partner investors have been reimbursed, (iii) the fund's cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred return and (iv) the Company has decided to collect carry rather than return additional capital to limited partner investors.\n\nFee-earning AUM was $94.8 billion at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $0.5 billion, or 1%, compared to $$95.3 billion at December 31, 2018. This was driven by outflows of $8.6 billion which were principally a result of dispositions in our U.S. Buyout, U.S. Real Estate, NGP Energy, and Europe Buyout funds, as well as distributions in other funds outside of their investment period. This was offset by inflows of $8.3 billion primarily related to the activation of management fees in CIEP II and CETP IV, as well as new fee-paying commitments raised in various other funds.\nObligations of CLOs. Loans payable of the Consolidated Funds represent amounts due to holders of debt securities issued by the CLOs. We are not liable for any loans payable of the CLOs. Several of the CLOs issued preferred shares representing the most subordinated interest, however these tranches are mandatorily redeemable upon the maturity dates of the senior secured loans payable, and as a result have been classified as liabilities under U.S. GAAP, and are included in loans payable of Consolidated Funds in our consolidated balance sheets. Loans payable of the CLOs are collateralized by the assets held by the CLOs and the assets of one CLO may not be used to satisfy the liabilities of another. This collateral consists of cash and cash equivalents, corporate loans, corporate bonds and other securities.\n(8) Represents the net accrued performance fee balance/(giveback obligation) as of the current quarter end.\n(1) Represents the original cost of investments since the inception of the fund. For CSP II and CSP III, reflects amounts net of investment level recallable proceeds which is adjusted to reflect recyclability of invested capital for the purpose of calculating the fund MOIC.\nDistributable Earnings. Distributable Earnings, or DE\u201d, is a key performance benchmark used in our industry and is evaluated regularly by management in making resource deployment and compensation decisions, and in assessing the performance of our three segments. We also use DE in our budgeting, forecasting, and the overall management of our segments. We believe that reporting DE is helpful to understanding our business and that investors should review the same supplemental financial measure that management uses to analyze our segment performance. DE is intended to show the amount of net realized earnings without the effects of consolidation of the Consolidated Funds. DE is derived from our segment reported results and is an additional measure to assess performance.\nFund performance information for our investment funds that have at least $1.0 billion in capital commitments, cumulative equity invested or total value as of December 31, 2020, which we refer to as our significant funds,\u201d is generally included throughout this discussion and analysis to facilitate an understanding of our results of operations for the periods presented. The fund return information reflected in this discussion and analysis is not indicative of the performance of The Carlyle Group Inc. and is also not necessarily indicative of the future performance of any particular fund. An investment in The Carlyle Group Inc. is not an investment in any of our funds. There can be no assurance that any of our funds or our other existing and future funds will achieve similar returns. See Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business Operations-The historical returns attributable to our funds, including those presented in this report, should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our funds or of our future results or of any returns expected on an investment in our common stock.\u201d\nPreferred Units. In September 2017, we issued 16 million of our Preferred Units for net proceeds of approximately $387.5 million. In October 2019, we completed the redemption of our Preferred Units for $25.339757 per unit, which is equal to $25.25 per preferred unit plus declared and unpaid distributions to, but excluding, the redemption date.\nFee Revenues. Total fee revenues decreased $80.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 and increased $136.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, due to the following:\nPreferred Unit Distributions and Redemption. With respect to distribution year 2019, the Board of Directors declared a distribution to preferred unitholders totaling approximately $19.1 million. In October 2019, we completed the redemption of our preferred units for $25.339757 per unit, which is equal to $25.25 per Preferred Unit plus declared and unpaid distributions to, but excluding, the redemption date.\nGenerally, the consolidation of the Consolidated Funds has a gross-up effect on our assets, liabilities and cash flows but has no net effect on the net income attributable to the Company and equity. The majority of the net economic ownership interests of the Consolidated Funds are reflected as non-controlling interests in consolidated entities in the consolidated financial statements. Because only a small portion of our funds are consolidated, the performance of the Consolidated Funds is not necessarily consistent with or representative of the combined performance trends of all of our funds.\n\u2022pay earnouts and contingent cash consideration associated with our acquisitions and strategic investments;\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Legacy Energy Funds had, in the aggregate, approximately $0.8 billion in AUM and $1.2 billion in Fee-earning AUM. We are no longer raising capital for the Legacy Energy Funds and expect these balances to continue to decrease over time as the funds wind down.\nPrior to the Conversion, we recorded significant non-controlling interests in Carlyle Holdings relating to the ownership interests of the limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships. The Company, through wholly owned subsidiaries, was the sole general partner of Carlyle Holdings. Accordingly, the Company consolidated the financial position and results of operations of Carlyle Holdings into its financial statements, and the other ownership interests in Carlyle Holdings are reflected as a non-controlling interest in the Company's financial statements. The limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships exchanged their Carlyle Holdings partnership units for an equivalent number of shares of common stock of The Carlyle Group Inc. as part of the Conversion. As a result, following the Conversion the consolidated balance sheet of The Carlyle Group Inc. does not reflect any non-controlling interests in Carlyle Holdings.\nFee-earning AUM is presented below for each period together with the components of change during each respective period.\nGlobal geopolitical tensions, already strained pre-pandemic, have been exacerbated by the widespread economic disruption. U.S.-China relations, which had appeared to ease at the end of 2019, soured during 2020 amid harsh rhetoric, sanctions, and export restrictions. While there is some optimism that tensions with China could ease under the new U.S. Administration, the outlook remains highly uncertain. The imposition of a national security law on Hong Kong has prompted backlash from various global players, thereby increasing overall uncertainty about risks associated with international trade with Hong Kong, the potential for increased taxation on Hong Kong-related transactions, and new regulatory restrictions and data protection concerns for businesses operating in Hong Kong, including our Hong Kong operations. Disputes over digital services taxes and import tariffs on luxury goods imports reignited U.S.-European Union trade tensions, although early signals from the new U.S. Administration suggest a desire to approach existing disagreements diplomatically. Political instability and the potential for a broader pullback in global trade introduce risks to the economic growth of most economies, particularly those with significant export-dependence. Domestically within the U.S., heightened unemployment and deep-seated political divisiveness continue to cause significant uncertainty.\nOverall, U.S. business spending, led by software and services, averaged nearly 8% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter of 2020, and our proprietary portfolio data continue to suggest that growth in certain industries such as healthcare and technology also remained robust. In Europe, there was continued growth in the business services and industrials sectors, but a large resurgence in coronavirus cases drove some retrenchment in affected industries and geographies. As has been the case since the onset of the pandemic, the travel, tourism, and hospitality sectors were particularly impacted. U.S. hotel occupancy fell to 37% of capacity in December, the lowest rate since the spring, while new restrictions on movement and business activity in Europe resulted in a modest quarter-over-quarter economic contraction. The U.S. Commerce Department estimates that the U.S. economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.0% in Q4 2020. As a result, gross domestic product (GDP) finished the year 2.5% below year-end 2019 levels and when averaged over the entirety of 2020, GDP contracted by 3.5% relative to 2019. In contrast, China continues to exhibit strong recovery, with economic output ending the fourth quarter 6.5% ahead of year-ago levels.\nDividends\n(1) Appreciation/(Depreciation) represents unrealized gain/(loss) for the period on a total return basis before fees and expenses. The percentage of return is calculated as: ending remaining investment fair market value plus net investment outflow (sales proceeds minus net purchases) minus beginning remaining investment fair market value divided by beginning remaining investment fair market value. Amounts are fund only, and do not include coinvestments.\n\n\n(2) For the years ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 and December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, foreign exchange adjustments are primarily driven by the revaluation in our European CLOs investments.\n\n\nmaturities of greater than three months when purchased. There were no corporate treasury investments as of December 31, 2020.\n(1) The Carlyle Aviation Partners acquisition included an earn-out of up to $150.0 million. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional detail.\nOur investments as of December 31, 2020 can be further attributed as follows:\n(2) Represents all realized proceeds since inception of the fund.\nTotal liabilities were $12.7 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $1,875.4 million from December 31, 2019. The increase in liabilities was primarily attributable to an increase in accrued compensation and benefits of $726.1 million primarily due to an increase in accrued performance allocations-related compensation and loans payable of Consolidated Funds of $856.3 million from December 31, 2019 to 2020, driven by the formation of two CLOs during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInterest and Other Income. Interest and other income decreased $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 and decreased $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily as a result of decreases from the reimbursement of certain costs incurred on behalf of Carlyle funds and decreases in interest income from investments in CLO subordinated notes and interest income related to corporate treasury investments that matured in 2019. The decrease in 2019 reflected a decrease in interest income related to corporate treasury investments, partially offset by the reimbursement of certain costs incurred on behalf of Carlyle funds.\nTrends Affecting our Business\nNo other fund generated over 10% of performance allocations in the periods presented above. Performance allocations from CP VI during 2020 were driven by appreciation across the portfolio, with notable increases in the values of the publicly traded investments in the portfolio.\nInterest and Other Expenses of Consolidated Funds. Interest and other expenses of Consolidated Funds increased $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to higher interest expense on the consolidated CLOs. Interest and other expenses of Consolidated Funds decreased $32.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to lower interest expense on the consolidated CLOs.\nRevenues\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the period in which the difference is expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period of the change in the provision for income taxes. Further, deferred tax assets are recognized for the expected realization of available net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. A valuation allowance is recorded on the Company's gross deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such asset will not be realized. When evaluating the realizability of the Company's deferred tax assets, all evidence, both positive and negative, is evaluated. Items considered in this analysis include the ability to carry back losses, the reversal of temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and expectations of future earnings. The Company has approximately $97 million of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2020. Changes in judgment as it relates to the realizability of these assets, as well as potential changes in corporate tax rates would have the effect of significantly reducing the value of the deferred tax assets.\n5.625% Senior Notes. In March 2013, Carlyle Holdings II Finance L.L.C. issued $400.0 million of 5.625% senior notes due March 30, 2043 at 99.583% of par. In March 2014, an additional $200.0 million of these notes were issued at 104.315% of par and are treated as a single class with the already outstanding $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of these notes.\n(a)the amount of limited partner capital commitments, generally for carry funds where the original investment period has not expired, for AlpInvest carry funds during the commitment fee period and for Metropolitan carry funds during the weighted-average investment period of the underlying funds (see Fee-earning AUM based on capital commitments\u201d in the table below for the amount of this component at each period);\n(4)Foreign Exchange represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated funds. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the period end.\nFee-earning AUM was $95.3 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $28.2 billion, or 42%, compared to $67.2 billion at December 31, 2017. This was driven by inflows of $35.9 billion principally from the activation of management fees in CP VII, CEP V, and CAP V. This was partially offset by outflows of $7.2 billion which were principally the result of fee basis stepdowns in CP VI, CEP IV and CAP IV, as well as distributions in other funds outside of their investment period.\n(4)Foreign Exchange represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated funds. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the period end.\nPrior to the Conversion, we recorded significant non-controlling interests in Carlyle Holdings related to the ownership interests of the limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships. The Company, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, was the sole general partner of Carlyle Holdings. Accordingly, the Company consolidated the financial position and results of operations of Carlyle Holdings into its consolidated financial statements. In the Conversion, the limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships exchanged their Carlyle Holdings partnership units for an equivalent number of shares of common stock of The Carlyle Group Inc. As a result, in periods following Conversion, the consolidated balance sheet of The Carlyle Group Inc. will not reflect any non-controlling interests in Carlyle Holdings. In addition, we expect that our provision for income taxes in periods following the Conversion will be greater than in periods prior to the Conversion because following the Conversion, all of our income before the provision for income taxes will be subject to U.S. federal (and state and local) corporate income taxes. See Part 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors-Following the Conversion, we expect to pay more corporate income taxes than we would have as a limited partnership.\u201d For these reasons, our results in periods following the Conversion may not be comparable to our results in periods prior to the Conversion.\nRollforwards of shares of our common stock outstanding and Carlyle Holdings partnership units for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nThe following table sets forth our total segment expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n(16) Aggregate includes the following Legacy Energy funds and related co-investments: Energy I, Energy II, Energy III, Energy IV, Renew I, and Renew II.\n\nThe Carlyle Holdings partnership units exchanged during the year ended December 31, 2020 relate to the exchange of Carlyle Holdings partnership units for an equivalent number of shares of common stock of the Company on January 1, 2020 pursuant to the Conversion. The Carlyle Holdings partnership units exchanged during the year ended December 31, 2019 relate to the exchange of Carlyle Holdings partnership units held by NGP and certain limited partners for shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis. Beginning with the second quarter of 2017, senior Carlyle professionals were able to exchange their Carlyle Holdings partnership units for shares of common stock on a quarterly basis, subject to the terms of the Exchange Agreement.\n\nUnder our arrangements with the historical owners and management team of AlpInvest, we generally do not retain any carried interest in respect of the historical investments and commitments to our fund vehicles that existed as of July 1, 2011 (including any options to increase any such commitments exercised after such date). We are entitled to 15% of the carried interest in respect of commitments from the historical owners of AlpInvest for the period between 2011 and 2020 and 40% of the carried interest in respect of all other commitments (including all future commitments from third parties). In certain instances, carried interest associated with the AlpInvest fund vehicles is subject to entity level income taxes in the Netherlands.\nGlobal Credit\nFor further information on our consolidation policy and the consolidation of certain funds, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEquity-based Compensation. Compensation expense relating to the issuance of equity-based awards to Carlyle employees is measured at fair value on the grant date. The compensation expense for awards that vest over a future service period is recognized over the relevant service period on a straight-line basis. The compensation expense for awards that do not require future service is recognized immediately. Cash settled equity-based awards are classified as liabilities and are re-measured at the end of each reporting period. The compensation expense for awards that contain performance conditions is recognized when it is probable that the performance conditions will be achieved; in certain instances, such compensation expense may be recognized prior to the grant date of the award. The compensation expense for awards that contain market conditions is based on a grant-date fair value that factors in the probability that the market conditions will be achieved and is recognized over the requisite service period on a straight-line basis.\n\nRealized Principal Investment Income. Another source of liquidity we may use to meet our capital needs is the realized principal investment income generated by our equity method investments and other principal investments. Principal investment income is realized when we redeem all or a portion of our investment or when we receive or are due cash income, such as dividends or distributions. Certain of the investments attributable to The Carlyle Group Inc. (excluding certain general partner interests, strategic investments, and investments in certain CLOs) may be sold at our discretion as a source of liquidity.\n(10) For funds marked NM,\u201d IRR may be positive or negative, but is not considered meaningful because of the limited time since initial investment and early stage of capital deployment. For funds marked Neg,\u201d IRR is considered meaningful but is negative as of reporting period end.\nIn determining the aggregate fair value of any award grants, we make judgments as to the grant-date fair value, particularly the discount related to awards that do not participate in distributions during the vesting period.", "item_7_text": "Equity-based awards issued to non-employees are recognized as general, administrative and other expenses, except to the extent they are recognized as a part of equity method earnings because they are issued to employees of the Company's equity method investees.\nThe decrease in fund management fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to lower management fees from CGIOF, including $20.4 million in catch-up management fees for subsequent closes in 2019, and lower management fees from NGP X, NGP XI and NGP XII. These decreases were partially offset by higher management fees from CIEP II, including catch-up management fees of $6.6 million in 2020, activation of management fees in 2020 on our fourth Japan buyout fund ( CJP IV\u201d), and higher management fees from CETP IV.\n\u2022provide capital to facilitate the growth of our existing business lines;\n(1) See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.\nThe weighted average management fee rate on our carry funds increased from 1.20% at December 31, 2019 to 1.22% at December 31, 2020 primarily due to fundraising in Carlyle Aviation Partners.\nFor additional information about the Conversion, see Part 1. Item 1. Business-Organizational Structure,\u201d Part II. Item 8. Note 10-Related Party Transactions,\u201d and Part II. Item 8. Note 11-Income Taxes.\u201d\n\nRisk Retention Rules\nThe weighted average management fee rate on our carry funds decreased from 1.23% at December 31, 2018 to 1.20% at December 31, 2019 primarily due to the step-down of the fee rate and basis in CEMOF II.\n(1)For additional information concerning the components of Fee-earning AUM, see -Fee-earning Assets under Management.\u201d\n(7)Ending balance excludes $13.4 billion of pending Fee-earning AUM for which fees have not yet been activated.\nWe have certain contingent cash obligations associated with our acquisition of Carlyle Aviation Partners and our strategic investment in Fortitude Re. For our acquisition of Carlyle Aviation Partners, the contingent cash payments relate to an earn-out of up to $150.0 million that is payable upon the achievement of certain revenue and earnings performance targets during 2020 through 2025, which will be accounted for as compensation expense. We accrue the compensation liability over the service period.\nThe Company consolidates all entities that it controls either through a majority voting interest or as the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities, which are collectively referred to as the Consolidated Funds in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2020, our Consolidated Funds represent approximately 2% of our AUM; 2% of our fund management fees; and less than 1% of our investment income for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n(1)Inflows represents limited partner capital raised by our carry funds or separately managed accounts for which management fees based on commitments were activated during the period, the fee-earning commitments invested in vehicles for which management fees are based on invested capital, the fee-earning collateral balance of new CLO issuances, as well as gross subscriptions in our vehicles for which management fees are based on net asset value. Inflows exclude fundraising amounts during the period for which fees have not yet been activated, which are referenced as Pending Fee-earning AUM. This also includes $4.1 billion of fee-earning Carlyle Aviation Partners (formerly Apollo Aviation Group) assets which were acquired in a transaction that closed in December 2018.\n(5) Multiple of invested capital ( MOIC\u201d) represents total fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried interest, divided by cumulative invested capital.\n\u2022fund capital expenditures;\n(3)Market Activity & Other generally represents realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments in our carry funds, related co-investment vehicles, and separately managed accounts, as well as the impact of fees, expenses and non-investment income, change in gross asset value for our business development companies and other changes in AUM.\nWe earn management fees pursuant to contractual arrangements with the investment funds that we manage and fees for transaction advisory and oversight services provided to portfolio companies of these funds. We also typically receive a performance fee from an investment fund, which may be either an incentive fee or a special residual allocation of income, which we refer to as a carried interest, in the event that specified investment returns are achieved by the fund. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d), we are required to consolidate some of the investment funds that we advise. However, for segment reporting purposes, we present revenues and expenses on a basis that deconsolidates these investment funds. Accordingly, our segment revenues primarily consist of fund management and related advisory fees and other income, realized performance revenues (consisting of incentive fees and carried interest allocations), realized principal investment income, including realized gains on our investments in our funds and other trading securities, as well as interest income. Our segment expenses primarily consist of cash compensation and benefits expenses, including salaries, bonuses, and realized performance payment arrangements, and general and administrative expenses. While our segment expenses include depreciation and interest expense, our segment expenses exclude acquisition-related charges and amortization of intangibles and impairment. Refer to Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the differences between our financial results reported pursuant to U.S. GAAP and our financial results for segment reporting purposes.\nFund Performance Metrics\nDistributable earnings increased $22.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, and decreased $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. The following table provides the components of the change in distributable earnings for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nUnconsolidated Entities\nTotal AUM was $49.4 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $5.0 billion, or 11%, compared to $44.4 billion at December 31, 2018. This was driven by $6.3 billion of inflows primarily due to new U.S. and Europe CLO issuances, as well as additional closes in CCOF. Also driving the increase was market and other activity of $1.2 billion, the majority of which was attributable to increases in the gross asset value of our BDC's and securitization vehicles. Partially offsetting the increase were outflows of $2.4 billion primarily related to distributions in our Energy Credit and Aviation funds, as well as CLO run-off.\n(2)Outflows represents the impact of realizations from vehicles with management fees based on remaining invested capital at cost or fair value, changes in basis for funds where the investment period, weighted-average investment period or commitment fee period has expired during the period, reductions for funds that are no longer calling for fees, gross redemptions in our open-end funds, and runoff of CLO collateral balances. Distributions for funds earning management fees based on commitments during the period do not affect Fee-earning AUM.\nIn 2018, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of approximately $144.1 million to common stockholders, consisting of the following:\nIn addition, we recorded incentive fees from Consolidated Funds of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. These fees eliminated upon consolidation. There were no incentive fees from Consolidated Funds recorded during the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019.\n\nunits to shares of common stock in The Carlyle Group Inc. in connection with the Conversion on January 1, 2020.\nGeneral, administrative and other indirect expenses. General, administrative and other indirect expenses decreased $33.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due the allocated portion of the cost recovery associated with the CCC matter of $6.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020 (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more information), as well as lower professional fees, due in part to expense recoveries from Carlyle FRL, and lower travel and entertainment expenses as a result of travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n3.875% Senior Notes. In January 2013, Carlyle Holdings Finance L.L.C. issued $500.0 million of 3.875% senior notes due February 1, 2023 at 99.966% of par. In September 2018, we completed a tender offer to purchase $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of these notes. As of December 31, 2020, $250.0 million of these notes remain outstanding.\nTotal AUM was $44.4 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $11.1 billion, or 33%, compared to $33.3 billion at December 31, 2017. This was driven by $12.1 billion of inflows primarily due to the acquisition of Carlyle Aviation Partners, as well as new U.S. and Europe CLO issuances and additional closes in our second BDC. Partially offsetting the increase were outflows of $1.1 billion primarily related to CLO run-off and distributions in our Global Credit carry funds.\nRecent Transactions\nIncome Taxes. On January 1, 2020, the Company converted from The Carlyle Group L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, to The Carlyle Group Inc., a Delaware corporation. As a result, all of the income before provision for income taxes attributable to The Carlyle Group Inc. is subject to U.S. federal (and state and local) corporate income taxes. Based on applicable federal, foreign, state and local tax laws, the Company records a provision for income taxes for certain entities. Tax positions taken by the Company are subject to periodic audit by U.S. federal, state, local and foreign taxing authorities.\n(b)The interest rates on the debt obligations as of December 31, 2020 consist of: 3.500% on $425.0 million of senior notes, 5.650% on $350 million of senior notes, 3.875% on $250.0 million of senior notes, 5.625% on $600.0 million of senior notes, and a range of approximately 1.58% to 2.63% for our CLO term loans. Interest payments assume that no prepayments are made and loans are held until maturity with the exception of the CLO term loans, which are based on the earlier of the stated maturity date or the date the CLO is expected to be dissolved.\n(10) Aggregate includes the following funds, as well as all active co-investments, separately managed accounts (SMA's), and stand-alone investments arranged by us: CVP II, MENA, CCI, CSSAF I, CSABF, CPF, CAP Growth I, and CBPF II.\nTotal AUM was $55.9 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $6.5 billion, or 13%, compared to $49.4 billion at December 31, 2019. This was driven by $9.5 billion of inflows primarily due to new U.S. and Europe CLO issuances, fundraising in CCOF II, and closings in various platform accounts. Also driving the increase was $0.7 billion in foreign exchange activity related to the translation of our EUR-denominated CLOs to USD. Partially offsetting the increase were outflows of $4.2 billion primarily related to distributions in our Energy Credit and Aviation funds, as well as CLO run-off.\n\nOur investment in NGP entitles us to 55% of the management fee-related revenue of the NGP entities that serve as advisors to the NGP Energy Funds and is subject to impairment under the U.S. GAAP accounting for equity method investments. We evaluate our equity method investment in NGP for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable, but no less than quarterly. For example, challenges with fundraising or lower future management fees could cause an impairment of our investment in NGP in the future. As of December 31, 2020, we continue to believe that our investment in NGP is not impaired.\nRealized Net Performance Revenues. Realized net performance revenues increased $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily driven by Carlyle Aviation Partners in 2020. Realized net performance revenues decreased $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. The majority of realized net performance revenues was generated by our distressed debt carry funds and our business development companies in 2018.\n(2)Outflows includes distributions net of recallable or recyclable amounts in our carry funds, related co-investment vehicles, separately managed accounts and the NGP Predecessor Funds, gross redemptions in our open-end funds, runoff of CLO collateral balances and the expiration of available capital.\n(3)Market Activity & Other represents realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments in our carry funds based on the lower of cost or fair value and net asset value.\nmarketplace, including the existence and transparency of transactions between market participants. Financial instruments with readily available quoted prices, or for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in active markets, will generally have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment applied in determining fair value.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 net investment (losses) gains of Consolidated Funds was $(21.3) million, $(23.9) million, and $4.5 million, respectively, comprised of the activity of the consolidated CLOs and certain other funds. For the consolidated CLOs, the amount reflects the net gain or loss on the fair value adjustment of both the assets and liabilities. The components of net investment gains of consolidated funds for the respective periods are:\nWe are not required under the consolidation guidance to consolidate in our financial statements most of the investment funds we advise. However, we consolidate certain CLOs that we advise. As of December 31, 2020, our consolidated CLOs held approximately $6.3 billion of total assets and comprised substantially all of the assets and loans payable of the Consolidated Funds. The assets and liabilities of the Consolidated Funds are generally held within separate legal entities and, as a result, the liabilities of the Consolidated Funds are non-recourse to us.\nWe also could incur additional expenses in the future related to our acquisitions including amortization of acquired intangibles and earn-outs to equity holders. As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, we evaluate our intangible assets (including goodwill) for impairment and could record additional impairment losses in future periods.\nNet income attributable to The Carlyle Group Inc. common stockholders per basic common share was $0.99, $3.05, and $0.89 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net income (loss) attributable to The Carlyle Group Inc. common unitholders per diluted common share was $0.97, $2.82, and $0.82 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n3.500% Senior Notes. In September 2019, Carlyle Finance Subsidiary L.L.C. issued $425.0 million of 3.500% senior notes due September 19, 2029 at 99.841% of par.\n\u2022fund the capital investments of Carlyle in our funds;\nIn February 2021, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share to common stockholders of record at the close of business on February 16, 2021, payable on February 23, 2021.\n(2)Includes amounts committed to or reserved for certain AlpInvest and Metropolitan carry funds.\nThe net accrued performance revenues attributable to The Carlyle Group Inc., excluding realized amounts, related to our carry funds and our other vehicles as of December 31, 2020, as well as the carry fund appreciation (depreciation), is set forth below by segment (Dollars in millions):\nContingent Obligations (Giveback)\n(6) Net Internal Rate of Return ( Net IRR\u201d) represents an annualized time-weighted return on Limited Partner invested capital, based on contributions, distributions and unrealized fair value as of the reporting date, after the impact of all management fees, partnership expenses and carried interest, including current accruals. Net IRR is calculated based on the timing of Limited Partner cash flows, which may differ to varying degrees from the timing of actual investment cash flows for the fund. Fund level IRRs are based on aggregate Limited Partner cash flows, and this blended return may differ from that of individual Limited Partners. As a result, certain funds may generate accrued performance revenues with a blended Net IRR that is below the preferred return hurdle for that fund. Subtotal Net IRR aggregations for multiple funds are calculated based on actual cash flow dates for each fund and represent a theoretical time-weighted return for a Limited Partner who invested sequentially in each fund.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities\n\nRealized Performance Allocation Revenues. Another source of liquidity we may use to meet our capital needs is the realized performance allocation revenues generated by our investment funds. Performance allocations are generally realized when an underlying investment is profitably disposed of and the fund's cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred return. For certain funds, performance allocations are realized once all invested capital and expenses have been returned to the fund's investors and the fund's cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred return. Incentive fees earned on our CLO vehicles generally are paid upon the dissolution of such vehicles.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to The Carlyle Group Inc. Common Stockholders\nRealized Principal Investment Income. Realized principal investment income decreased $21.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 and increased $33.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared\n\nThe decrease in realized net performance revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to to lower performance revenue realizations from our U.S., Europe and Asia buyout funds in carry, as well as $19.0 million of realized clawback on Riverstone Legacy Energy Fund IV in 2019, partially offset by higher realizations on our U.S. real estate funds.\nFor segment reporting purposes, revenues and expenses are presented on a basis that deconsolidates our Consolidated Funds. As a result, segment revenues from management fees, realized performance revenues and realized principal investment income (loss) are different than those presented on a consolidated U.S. GAAP basis because these revenues recognized in certain segments are received from Consolidated Funds and are eliminated in consolidation when presented on a consolidated U.S. GAAP basis. Furthermore, segment expenses are different than related amounts presented on a consolidated U.S. GAAP basis due to the exclusion of fund expenses that are paid by the Consolidated Funds.\n(1) The dividend to common stockholders for Q4 2019 reflects the exchange of all Carlyle Holdings partnership\n\u2022In evaluating whether the Company holds a variable interest, fees (including management fees, incentive fees and performance allocations) that are customary and commensurate with the level of services provided, and where the Company does not hold other economic interests in the entity that would absorb more than an insignificant amount of the expected losses or returns of the entity, are not considered variable interests. The Company considers all economic interests, including indirect interests, to determine if a fee is considered a variable interest.\nOperating Metrics\n(1)Inflows reflects the impact of gross fundraising during the period. For funds or vehicles denominated in foreign currencies, this reflects translation at the average quarterly rate, while the separately reported Fundraising metric is translated at the spot rate for each individual closing.\nEach investment fund is considered separately in evaluating carried interest and potential giveback obligations. As a result, performance allocations within funds will continue to fluctuate primarily due to certain investments within each fund constituting a material portion of the carry in that fund. Additionally, the fair value of investments in our funds may have substantial fluctuations from period to period.\nGuarantees\n\nvehicles for which management fees are based on invested capital. Inflows exclude fundraising amounts during the period for which fees have not yet been activated, which are referenced as Pending Fee-earning AUM.\nWe generated $6.9 billion in realized proceeds from our carry funds in the fourth quarter and realized $21.0 billion in 2020. We expect near-term exit activity in early 2021 to depend on the trajectory of multiple and varied macro environment factors, in addition to valuation multiples and access to capital markets. However, we believe that our recent IPO activity and maturing portfolio position us well to deliver higher levels of both realized proceeds and realized performance revenue over the long term. For example, during the fourth quarter we realized significant performance revenue for a second straight quarter from our sixth U.S. Buyout fund, which reflects the value creation and advancing maturity profile of that flagship fund.\nPrinciples of Consolidation. The Company consolidates all entities that it controls either through a majority voting interest or as the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d). The Company describes the policies and procedures it uses in evaluating whether an entity is consolidated in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As part of its consolidation procedures, the Company evaluates: (1) whether it holds a variable interest in an entity, (2) whether the entity is a VIE, and (3) whether the Company's involvement would make it the primary beneficiary.\n(4)Foreign Exchange represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated funds. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the period end.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nRealized carried interest may be clawed back or given back to the fund if the fund's investment values decline below certain return hurdles, which vary from fund to fund. When the fair value of a fund's investments remains constant or falls below certain return hurdles, previously recognized performance allocations are reversed. In all cases, each investment fund is considered separately in evaluating carried interest and potential giveback obligations. For any given period, performance allocations revenue on our statement of operations may include reversals of previously recognized performance allocations due to a decrease in the value of a particular fund that results in a decrease of cumulative performance allocations earned to date. Since fund return hurdles are cumulative, previously recognized performance allocations also may be reversed in a period of appreciation that is lower than the particular fund's hurdle rate. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the reversals of performance allocations were $401.5 million, $215.8 million and $364.4 million, respectively. Additionally, unrealized performance allocations reverse when performance allocations are realized, and unrealized performance allocations can be negative if the amount of realized performance allocations exceed total performance allocations generated in the period.\nof our investment to a Carlyle-affiliated investment fund (see Note 5-Investments to the consolidated financial statements) . Realized principal investment income (loss) is recorded when we redeem all or a portion of our investment or when we receive or are due cash income, such as dividends or distributions. A realized principal investment loss is also recorded when an investment is deemed to be worthless. Unrealized principal investment income (loss) results from changes in the fair value of the underlying investment, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains (losses) at the time an investment is realized.\nWhile carried interest is recognized upon appreciation of the funds' investment values above certain return hurdles set forth in each respective partnership agreement, the Company recognizes revenues attributable to performance allocations based upon the amount that would be due pursuant to the fund partnership agreement at each period end as if the funds were terminated at that date. Accordingly, the amount recognized as performance allocations reflects the Company's share of the gains and losses of the associated funds' underlying investments measured at their then-current fair values relative to the fair values as of the end of the prior period. Because of the inherent uncertainty, these estimated values may differ significantly\nIndemnifications\nConsolidation of Certain Carlyle Funds\n(4)Reflects the net asset value of certain other carry funds.\nIn 2019, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of approximately $194.8 million to common stockholders, consisting of the following:\nEarnings Per Common Share. We compute earnings per common share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to the common shares of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per common share reflects the assumed conversion of all dilutive securities. We apply the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive weighted-average common shares represented by unvested restricted stock units. Prior to the Conversion, we applied the if-converted\u201d method to the Carlyle Holdings partnership units to determine the dilutive weighted-average common units outstanding.\nTotal AUM was $129.8 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $3.4 billion, or 3%, compared to $126.4 billion at December 31, 2018. This increase was driven by $10.7 billion of inflows primarily due to fundraising in CJP IV, CGP II, CETP IV, and CIEP II. Also contributing to this increase was market appreciation and other activity of $2.9 billion due to appreciation in our carry funds partially offset by the impact of management fees and expenses. The carry funds driving appreciation for the period included $0.9 billion attributable to CP VI, $0.5 billion attributable to CP VII, and $0.4 billion attributable to CAP V. Partially offsetting the increase were $9.9 billion of outflows driven primarily by distributions in our U.S. Real Estate, NGP Energy, and U.S. Buyout funds.\nUnder U.S. GAAP for income taxes, the amount of tax benefit to be recognized is the amount of benefit that is more likely than not\u201d to be sustained upon examination. The Company analyzes its tax filing positions in all of the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns, as well as for all open tax years in these jurisdictions. If, based on this analysis, the Company determines that uncertainties in tax positions exist, a liability is established, which is included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions in the provision for income taxes. If recognized, the entire amount of unrecognized tax positions would be recorded as a reduction in the provision for income taxes.\nPrincipal Equity-Method Investments. The Company accounts for all investments in which it has or is otherwise presumed to have significant influence, including investments in the unconsolidated funds and strategic investments, using the equity method of accounting. The carrying value of equity-method investments is determined based on amounts invested by the Company, adjusted for the equity in earnings or losses of the investee allocated based on the respective partnership or other agreement, less distributions received. The Company evaluates its equity-method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may not be recoverable.\nThe senior revolving credit facility is unsecured. We are required to maintain management fee earning assets (as defined in the amended and restated senior revolving credit facility) of at least $75.0 billion and a total leverage ratio of less than 3.0 to 1.0, in each case, tested on a quarterly basis. Non-compliance with any of the financial or non-financial covenants without cure or waiver would constitute an event of default under the senior revolving credit facility. An event of default resulting from a breach of certain financial or non-financial covenants may result, at the option of the lenders, in an acceleration of the principal and interest outstanding, and a termination of the senior revolving credit facility. The senior credit facility also contains other customary events of default, including defaults based on events of bankruptcy and insolvency, nonpayment of principal, interest or fees when due, breach of specified covenants, change in control and material inaccuracy of representations and warranties.\nDividends to our common stockholders were $351.3 million, $154.9 million, and $129.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Distributions to the non-controlling interest holders in Carlyle Holdings were $313.3 million and $288.8 million the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The net (payments) borrowings on loans payable by our Consolidated Funds during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $704.1 million, $224.8 million, and $818.0 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, contributions from non-controlling interest holders were $210.0 million, $57.8 million, and $31.3 million, respectively, which relate primarily to contributions from the non-controlling interest holders in Consolidated Funds. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, distributions to non-controlling interest holders were $77.8 million, $62.4 million, and $105.2 million, respectively, which relate primarily to distributions to the non-controlling interest holders in Consolidated Funds.\nManagement fees attributable to Carlyle Partners VII, L.P. ( CP VII\u201d), our seventh U.S. buyout fund with approximately $17.5 billion of Fee-earning AUM as of December 31, 2020, was 17% of total management fees recognized during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and 13% during the year ended December 31, 2018. No other fund generated over 10% of total management fees in the periods presented.\nExcluded from the table above are liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $24.0 million at December 31, 2020 as we are unable to estimate when such amounts may be paid.\nThe following table shows our total segment Distributable Earnings, or DE\u201d, and Fee Related Earnings, or FRE\u201d, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nWe generally use our working capital and cash flows to invest in growth initiatives, service our debt, fund the working capital needs of our business and investment funds and pay dividends to our common stockholders.\nFair Value Measurement. U.S. GAAP establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which ranks the observability of market price inputs used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. The observability of inputs is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, the characteristics specific to the financial instrument and the state of the\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nCash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, excluding the activities of our Consolidated Funds, were $716.8 million, $591.3 million and $461.2 million, respectively. Operating cash inflows primarily include the receipt of management fees and realized performance allocations and incentive fees, while operating cash\n(4) See reconciliation to most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure below:\nThe increase in fund management fees for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily driven by management fees from Carlyle Aviation Partners, which was acquired in December 2018, management fees from CLOs that originated in 2018 and 2019, as well as increased management fees from our direct lending platform.\n\u2022For those entities where the Company holds a variable interest, the Company determines whether each of these entities qualifies as a VIE and, if so, whether or not the Company is the primary beneficiary. The assessment of whether the entity is a VIE is generally performed qualitatively, which requires judgment. These judgments include: (a) determining whether the equity investment at risk is sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, (b) evaluating whether the equity holders, as a group, can make decisions that have a significant effect on the economic performance of the entity, (c) determining whether two or more parties' equity interests should be aggregated, and (d) determining whether the equity investors have proportionate voting rights to their obligations to absorb losses or rights to receive returns from an entity.\n\nto 2018. The decrease in realized principal investment income for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to the recovery of $71.5 million from the final resolution of French tax litigation concerning a European real estate fund in 2019, partially offset by higher realized gains in 2020 from CP VI, CEP IV and CAP IV.\n(9) Aggregate includes Main Fund VII - Fund Investments, Main Fund VIII - Fund Investments, Main Fund IX - Fund Investments, Main Fund X - Fund Investments, Main Fund XI - Fund Investments, Main Fund IV - Mezzanine Investments, Main Fund V - Mezzanine Investments, all \u2018clean technology' private equity investments, all strategic co-investment mandates that invest in co-investment opportunities arising out of an investor's own separate private equity relationships and invitations, all strategic capital mandates, any state-focused investment mandates, and all other investors whose investments are not reflected in a Main Fund.\n(2)Outflows represents the impact of realizations from vehicles with management fees based on remaining invested capital at cost or fair value, changes in basis for funds where the investment period, weighted-average investment period or commitment fee period has expired during the period, reductions for funds that are no longer calling for fees, gross redemptions in our open-end funds, and runoff of CLO collateral balances. Realizations for funds earning management fees based on commitments during the period do not affect Fee-earning AUM.\nCash-based compensation and benefits expense. Cash-based compensation and benefits expense increased $20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to increased headcount and higher cash bonuses. Cash-based compensation and benefits expense increased $44.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to the Carlyle Aviation Partners acquisition, as well as increased headcount and higher cash bonuses.\n(5)Includes funds with fees based on gross asset value.\nCorporate Treasury Investments. These investments represent investments in U.S. Treasury and government agency obligations, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, other investment grade securities and other investments with original\nAvailable Capital. Available Capital refers to the amount of capital commitments available to be called for investments, which may be reduced for equity invested that is funded via a fund credit facility and expected to be called from investors at a later date, plus any additional assets/liabilities at the fund level other than active investments. Amounts previously called may be added back to available capital following certain distributions. Expired Available Capital\u201d occurs when a fund has passed the investment and follow-on periods and can no longer invest capital into new or existing deals. Any remaining Available Capital, typically a result of either recycled distributions or specific reserves established for the follow-on period that are not drawn, can only be called for fees and expenses and is therefore removed from the Total AUM calculation.\n(1) Units issued include restricted common units and units issued and delivered in connection with our equity method investment in NGP.\nFee related earnings increased $51.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, and decreased $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. The following table provides the components of the change in fee related earnings for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019 and Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\n\nWith continued positive impact from valuations across the portfolio, net accrued performance revenues on our balance sheet increased to a record $2.3 billion at December 31, 2020, up 36% since last year. Significant IPO activity in our portfolio during 2020 has increased the portion of our traditional carry funds attributable to publicly traded companies to 15% of fair value in the fourth quarter, compared to 6% at the end of 2019. While these IPOs have performed well to date overall, this shift may result in an increasing correlation to public market performance and a significant concentration of investment gains in individual investments for certain funds. To the extent that there is volatility in public equity markets and/or the prices of our publicly-traded portfolio companies, there may be elevated volatility in our performance revenue accrual in the coming quarters.\n\u2022pay operating expenses, including compensation and compliance costs and other obligations as they arise;\n(10) Aggregate includes the following funds, as well as related co-investments, separately managed accounts (SMA's), and certain other stand-alone investments arranged by us: CSP I, CMP I, CMP II, and CASCOF.\nFor our strategic investment in Fortitude Re, the contingent cash payment relates to performance-based contingent cash consideration payable to Carlyle FRL for further payment to AIG following December 31, 2023. Based on the terms of the underlying contracts, the maximum amount that could be paid from contingent cash obligations associated with the acquisition of Carlyle Aviation Partners and the strategic investment in Fortitude Re as of December 31, 2020 is $245.0 million versus amounts recognized on the balance sheet of $145.6 million.\n\nCommon Stockholder Dividends. Our intention is to pay dividends to holders of our common stock in an amount of $0.25 per share of common stock ($1.00 per share annually), subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and compliance with applicable law. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, any dividends we pay following the Conversion generally will be treated as qualified dividend income (generally taxable to U.S. individual stockholders at capital gain rates) paid by a domestic corporation to the extent paid out of current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes, with any excess dividends treated as return of capital to the extent of the stockholder's basis. The declaration and payment of dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors, and our dividend policy may be changed at any time.\n\u2022Global Private Equity - Our Global Private Equity segment advises our 34 buyout and middle market and growth capital funds, our 10 U.S. and internationally focused real estate funds, our 14 natural resources funds, and our three Legacy Energy funds. The segment also includes three NGP Predecessor Funds and five NGP Carry Funds advised by NGP. As of December 31, 2020, our Global Private Equity segment had $131.8 billion in AUM and $91.6 billion in Fee-earning AUM.\nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information related to performance allocations for various fund types, preferred return hurdle rates, the timing of performance allocation recognition in investment income, and the potential for performance allocation income reversal.\nFor further information regarding our off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 2 and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(3) Equity-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 includes amounts presented in principal investment income and general, administrative and other expenses in our U.S. GAAP statement of operations.\nPerformance Allocation Related Compensation. A portion of the performance allocations earned is due to employees and advisers of the Company. These amounts are accounted for as compensation expense in conjunction with the recognition of the related performance allocation revenue and, until paid, are recognized as a component of the accrued compensation and benefits liability. Accordingly, upon a reversal of performance allocation revenue, the related compensation expense, if any, is also reversed.\n(h)These obligations represent commitments of the CLOs to fund certain investments. These amounts are generally due on demand and are therefore presented in the less than one year category.\nFund Performance Metrics\nEquity-based compensation. Equity-based compensation decreased $35.0 million, or 25%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019. The decrease in equity-based compensation from 2019 to 2020 was due primarily to the lower rate of ongoing grants of restricted stock units, as well as a forfeiture credit recorded in 2020 related to the retirement of one of our co-chief executive officers.\nInterest and Other Income of Consolidated Funds. Our CLOs generate interest income primarily from investments in bonds and loans inclusive of amortization of discounts and generate other income from consent and amendment fees. Substantially all interest and other income of the CLOs and other consolidated funds together with interest expense of our CLOs and net investment gains of Consolidated Funds is attributable to the related funds' limited partners or CLO investors. Accordingly, such amounts have no material impact on net income attributable to the Company.\nThe following table and discussion sets forth information regarding our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on substantially the same basis for all historical periods presented; however, the consolidated funds are not the same entities in all periods shown due to changes in U.S. GAAP, changes in fund terms and the creation and termination of funds. As further described above, the consolidation of these funds primarily had the impact of increasing interest and other income of Consolidated Funds, interest and other expenses of Consolidated Funds, and net investment gains of Consolidated Funds in the year that the fund is initially consolidated. The consolidation of these funds had no effect on net income attributable to the Company for the periods presented.\nGlobal equity markets remained strong in 2020, driven by the sharp decline in interest rates, significant increases in fiscal support, and the sense among market participants that the COVID-19 pandemic reflects a temporary decline in the supply of certain experiences and services rather than an endogenous drop in consumer demand. Over the past year, the S&P 500 rose by roughly 15%, with much larger gains in tech-heavy indexes like the Nasdaq whose constituents have tended to benefit from social distancing and remote work. The global equity markets saw a particularly strong surge from November 6 onwards after the overwhelmingly positive results of COVID-19 vaccine trials were announced. From September 30 through December 31, 2020, the S&P 500, MSCI ACWI, EuroStoxx 600, and Shanghai Composite rose 11.7%, 14.4%, 10.5%, and 7.9%, respectively. Much of this performance, particularly in the U.S., was driven by a rebound in sectors where equity prices had been hardest hit by the pandemic, such as hospitality, financials, brick-and-mortar retail, and oil & gas. In the U.S., analysts currently estimate fourth quarter earnings for companies in the S&P 500 declined 5% year-over-year, with the largest contractions still concentrated in the energy and industrials (including transportation) sectors.\nFee-earning AUM was $28.4 billion at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $0.7 billion, or 2%, compared to $29.1 billion at December 31, 2018. This decrease was driven by outflows of $4.0 billion primarily attributable to distributions in our AlpInvest funds as well as $0.4 billion of foreign exchange activity related to the translation of our AlpInvest Fee-earning AUM from EUR to USD. Partially offsetting this decrease were inflows of $3.7 billion primarily attributable to fundraising in our AlpInvest funds as well as capital deployed in our AlpInvest funds which charge fees based on invested capital.\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities. Net cash used in operating activities was primarily driven by our earnings in the respective periods after adjusting for significant non-cash activity, including non-cash performance allocations and incentive fees, the related non-cash performance allocations and incentive fee related compensation, non-cash principal investment income, non-cash equity-based compensation, and depreciation, amortization and impairments, all of which are included in earnings.\nFee-earning AUM as of and for each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2020\nA substantial majority of the remaining commitments are expected to be funded by senior Carlyle professionals, operating executives and other professionals through our internal co-investment program. Of the $3.5 billion of unfunded commitments, approximately $3.0 billion is subscribed individually by senior Carlyle professionals, operating executives and other professionals, with the balance funded directly by the Company.\n(d)We lease office space in various countries around the world and maintain our headquarters in Washington, D.C., where we have a non-cancelable lease agreement expiring on March 31, 2030. We entered into a non-cancelable lease agreement expiring in 2036 for new office space in New York City that commenced in 2020. Our office leases in other locations expire in various years through 2032. The amounts in this table represent the minimum lease payments required over the term of the lease.\n(9) Aggregate includes the following funds, as well as all active co-investments, separately managed accounts (SMA's), and stand-alone investments arranged by us: SASOF II, SASOF III, and SASOF IV.\n\n(c)the amount of aggregate fee-earning collateral balance at par of our CLOs and other securitization vehicles, as defined in the fund indentures (typically exclusive of equities and defaulted positions) as of the quarterly cut-off date;\nOur Balance Sheet\nWe will continue to comply with the risk retention rules governing CLOs issued in Europe for which we are a sponsor, which require a combination of capital from our balance sheet, commitments from senior Carlyle professionals, and/or third party financing.\n(c) the net asset value of certain carry funds; and\nGeneral, administrative and other indirect expenses. General, administrative and other indirect expenses decreased $57.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to the allocated portion of the cost recovery associated with the CCC matter of $20.3 million (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more information), lower professional fees and lower travel and entertainment expenses as a result of travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. General, administrative and other indirect expenses decreased $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to lower external costs associated with fundraising activities.\n(1) See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.\noutflows primarily include payments for operating expenses, including compensation and general, administrative, and other expenses. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, net cash provided by operating activities primarily includes the receipt of management fees and realized performance allocations and incentive fees, totaling approximately $2.1 billion, $1.9 billion, and $2.0 billion, respectively. These inflows were partially offset by payments for compensation and general, administrative, and other expenses of approximately $1.6 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\nRealized Net Performance Revenues. Realized net performance revenues increased $64.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, and decreased $147.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. Realized net performance revenues increased in 2020 as we began realizing carry from CP VI during the year, and we generated higher performance revenue realizations from our financial services and Europe real estate funds. Realized net performance revenues in 2019 were also impacted by the realized clawback on one of the Legacy Energy funds.\nThe weighted average management fee rate increased from 1.23% at December 31, 2018 to 1.26% at December 31, 2019. The increase in the weighted average management fee rate was driven by additional fundraising and fee activation in funds with higher effective fee rates than the segment weighted average. Fee-earning AUM was $94.8 billion and $95.3 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, reflecting a decrease of $0.5 billion\n(1)Inflows represents limited partner capital raised by our carry funds or separately managed accounts for which management fees based on commitments were activated during the period, the fee-earning commitments invested in vehicles for which management fees are based on invested capital, the fee-earning collateral balance of new CLO issuances, as well as gross subscriptions in our vehicles for which management fees are based on net asset value. Inflows exclude fundraising amounts during the period for which fees have not yet been activated, which are referenced as Pending Fee-earning AUM. Inflows also includes $4.1 billion of fee-earning Carlyle Aviation Partners (formerly Apollo Aviation Group) assets which were acquired in a transaction that closed in December 2018.\nFund performance information for our investment funds that generally have at least $1.0 billion in capital commitments, cumulative equity invested or total value as of December 31, 2020, which we refer to as our significant funds,\u201d\nIn many of our service contracts, we agree to indemnify the third-party service provider under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract, and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the estimate above or recorded in our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020.\nTotal AUM was $126.4 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $11.0 billion, or 9%, compared to $115.4 billion at December 31, 2017. This increase was driven by $22.6 billion of inflows primarily due to fundraising in CEP IV, CP VII, and CAP V. Also contributing to this increase was market appreciation and other activity of $3.3 billion. The carry funds driving appreciation for the period included $1.0 billion attributable to CP VI, $0.5 billion attributable to CEP IV, and $0.4 billion attributable to CP V. Partially offsetting this increase were $14.1 billion of outflows driven primarily by distributions in our U.S. Buyout, Asia Buyout and U.S. Real Estate funds.\nThe table below breaks out Fee-earning AUM by its respective components at each period.\n\n\n(9) Represents all realized proceeds combined with remaining fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried interest.\n(3)Represents the amount of aggregate Fee-earning collateral balances and principal balances, at par, for our CLOs/structured products.\nEquity-based compensation decreased $99.9 million, or 42%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. The decrease in equity-based compensation from 2018 to 2019 was due primarily to the timing of the last vesting of awards in May 2018 related to our initial public offering in 2012 and lower rate of ongoing grants of restricted stock units.\n\u2022Investment Solutions - Our Investment Solutions segment advises global private equity and real estate fund of funds programs and related co-investment and secondary activities across 283 fund vehicles. As of December 31, 2020, our Investment Solutions segment had $58.1 billion in AUM and $36.4 billion in Fee-earning AUM.\nCarlyle Common Stock and Carlyle Holdings Partnership Units\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated entities was $34.6 million, $36.6 million, and $33.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These amounts are primarily attributable to the net earnings of the Consolidated Funds for each period, which are substantially all allocated to the related funds' limited partners or CLO investors. The net income (loss) of our Consolidated Funds, after eliminations, was $8.1 million, $10.0 million, and $(5.3) million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated entities also includes net income attributable to non-controlling interests in carried interest, giveback obligations, and cash held for carried interest distributions.\nTotal AUM as of and for each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2020\nSee Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our contingent obligations (giveback).\n(3)Market Activity & Other generally represents realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments in our carry funds, related co-investment vehicles and separately managed accounts, the net impact of fees, expenses and non-investment income, as well as other changes in AUM. The fair market values for our Investment Solutions primary and secondary carry funds are based on the latest available valuations of the underlying limited partnership interests as provided by their general partners which typically has a lag of up to 90 days, plus the net cash flows since the latest valuation, up to December 31, 2020.\nInvestment Income. Investment income consists of our performance allocations as well as the realized and unrealized gains and losses resulting from our equity method investments and other principal investments.\nHistorical Liquidity and Capital Resources\nTotal AUM as of and for each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2020\nWe monitor certain operating metrics that are common to the asset management industry.\nis included throughout this discussion and analysis to facilitate an understanding of our results of operations for the periods presented. The fund return information reflected in this discussion and analysis is not indicative of the performance of The Carlyle Group Inc. and is also not necessarily indicative of the future performance of any particular fund. An investment in The Carlyle Group Inc. is not an investment in any of our funds. There can be no assurance that any of our funds or our other existing and future funds will achieve similar returns. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business Operations - The historical returns attributable to our funds, including those presented in this report, should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our funds or of our future results or of any returns expected on an investment in our common stock.\u201d\nWe may hire additional individuals and overall compensation levels may correspondingly increase, which could result in an increase in compensation and benefits expense. As a result of acquisitions, we have charges associated with contingent consideration taking the form of earn-outs and profit participation, some of which are reflected as compensation expense.\n\n\n\u2022make installment payments under the deferred obligation to former holders of Carlyle Holdings partnership units, which were exchanged in the Conversion, and;\n(g)These obligations represent amounts due to holders of debt securities issued by the consolidated CLO vehicles. These obligations include interest to be paid on debt securities issued by the consolidated CLO vehicles. Interest payments assume that no prepayments are made and loans are held until maturity. For debt securities with rights only to the residual value of the CLO and no stated interest, no interest payments were included in this calculation. Interest payments on variable-rate debt securities are based on interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2020, at spreads to market rates pursuant to the debt agreements, and range from 0.40% to 8.03%.\nConversion to a Corporation\n\n(4) Represents all realized proceeds combined with remaining fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried interest.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019 and Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\n(1)Inflows represents limited partner capital raised by our carry funds or separately managed accounts for which management fees based on commitments were activated during the period, the fee-earning commitments invested in vehicles for which management fees are based on invested capital, and gross subscriptions in open-ended vehicles with management fees based on net asset value. Inflows exclude fundraising amounts during the period for which fees have not yet been activated, which are referenced as Pending Fee-earning AUM.\n(f)the lower of cost or fair value of invested capital, generally for AlpInvest carry funds where the commitment fee period has expired and certain carry funds where the investment period has expired, (see Fee-earning AUM based on lower of cost or fair value and other\u201d in the table below for the amount of this component at each period).\n\u2022fund costs of litigation and contingencies, including related legal costs;\n\u2022repay borrowings and related interest costs and expenses;\nPerformance Allocations. Performance allocations increased $836.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 and increased $176.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. Performance allocations by segment for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 comprised the following:\nCarried interest is ultimately realized when: (1) an underlying investment is profitably disposed of, (2) certain costs borne by the limited partner investors have been reimbursed, (3) the fund's cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred return and (4) we have decided to collect carry rather than return additional capital to limited partner investors. Realized carried interest may be required to be returned by us in future periods if the fund's investment values decline below certain levels. When the fair value of a fund's investments remains constant or falls below certain return hurdles, previously recognized performance allocations are reversed.\nNet Investment Gains of Consolidated Funds. Net investment gains of Consolidated Funds measures the change in the difference in fair value between the assets and the liabilities of the Consolidated Funds. A gain (loss) indicates that the fair value of the assets of the Consolidated Funds appreciated more (less), or depreciated less (more), than the fair value of the liabilities of the Consolidated Funds. A gain or loss is not necessarily indicative of the investment performance of the Consolidated Funds and does not impact the management or incentive fees received by Carlyle for its management of the Consolidated Funds. The portion of the net investment gains (losses) of Consolidated Funds attributable to the limited partner investors is allocated to non-controlling interests. Therefore a gain or loss is not expected to have a material impact on the revenues or profitability of the Company. Moreover, although the assets of the Consolidated Funds are consolidated onto our balance sheet pursuant to U.S. GAAP, ultimately we do not have recourse to such assets and such liabilities are generally non-recourse to us. Therefore, a gain or loss from the Consolidated Funds generally does not impact the assets available to our equity holders.\nThe increase in fund management fees for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to the activation of management fees during 2018 on our seventh U.S. buyout fund ( CP VII\u201d), our fifth Asia buyout fund ( CAP V\u201d) and our fifth Europe buyout fund ( CEP V\u201d), and on our fourth Europe technology fund ( CETP IV\u201d) during the third quarter of 2019. We also had increased management fees from CGIOF, CIEP II, CPI and NGP XII, partially offset by lower management fees from CRP VII, CIEP I, CEREP III and CRP V. Management fees also increased as a result of $26.4 million in catch-up management fees for subsequent closes in 2019 for CGIOF and NGP XII. These increases were partially offset by lower fee rates and a lower basis for CP VI, CAP IV, CEP IV, and CETP III as they exited the investment period.\nOther Non-operating Expenses (Income). For the year ended December 31, 2020, this caption includes the impact of the Conversion on our tax receivable agreement liability, which was reduced by $9.3 million. See Note 11 to the consolidated\nTotal revenues decreased $442.4 million, or 13%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 and increased $949.8 million, or 39%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. The following table provides the components of the changes in total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nOur equity-method investment in NGP entitles us to 55% of the management fee-related revenue of the NGP entities that serve as advisors to the NGP Energy Funds and is subject to impairment under the U.S. GAAP accounting for equity method investments. For example, challenges with fundraising or lower future management fees could cause an impairment of our investment in NGP in the future. As of December 31, 2020, we continue to believe that our investment in NGP is not impaired.\nContingent Cash Payments For Business Acquisitions and Strategic Investments\nBond markets, while stable, shifted modestly in the fourth quarter. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose more than 25 basis points over the quarter to its highest level since March on expectations of increased government spending under the new Administration and closely divided Congress. High yield spreads tightened a further 150 basis points. Futures markets continue to expect short-term rates to remain near zero through 2025 due to the Federal Reserve's new policy framework, which appears to allow inflation to overshoot its 2% target for some time.\u201d Within corporate credit, businesses have taken advantage of low interest rates through massive debt issuance and restructurings, building large cash piles as liquidity buffers.\nThe following table presents our results of operations for our Investment Solutions segment:\n\u2022For entities that are determined to be VIEs, the Company consolidates those entities where it has concluded it is the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is defined as the variable interest holder with (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In evaluating whether the Company is the primary beneficiary, the Company evaluates its economic interests in the entity held either directly or indirectly by the Company.\n\n\n(2)Includes funds with fees based on gross asset value.\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, many observers conflated a return to the office with a return to business as usual.

Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the period end.\nRepurchase Program. In December 2018, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of common stock and/or Carlyle Holdings units. In January 2020 our Board of Directors re-authorized the repurchase program with regard or common stock. This program authorizes the repurchase of shares of common stock from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid an aggregate of $26.4 million to repurchase and retire approximately 1.1 million shares with all of the repurchases done via open market brokered transactions. As of December 31, 2020, $139.1 million of repurchase capacity remained under the program. In February 2021, our Board of Directors replenished the repurchase program to its limit of $200 million of common stock.\nFee-earning AUM was $36.4 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $8.0 billion, or 28%, compared to $28.4 billion at December 31, 2019. This increase was driven by inflows of $10.7 billion primarily attributable to fundraising in our AlpInvest funds as well as capital deployed in our AlpInvest funds which charge fees based on invested capital. Foreign exchange activity related to the translation of our AlpInvest Fee-earning AUM from EUR to USD resulted in an increase in Fee-earning AUM of $1.8 billion. Partially offsetting this increase were outflows of $3.7 billion primarily attributable to distributions in our AlpInvest funds. Distributions from funds still in the commitment or weighted-average investment period do not impact Fee-earning AUM as these funds are based on commitments and not invested capital. Increases in fair value may have an impact on Fee-earning AUM for Investment Solutions as the management fees for many fully committed funds are based on fair value or on the lower of cost or fair value of the underlying investments.\nPerformance allocations consist principally of the performance-based capital allocation from fund limited partners to us, commonly referred to as carried interest, from certain of our investment funds, which we refer to as the carry funds.\u201d Carried interest revenue is recognized by Carlyle upon appreciation of the valuation of our funds' investments above certain return hurdles as set forth in each respective partnership agreement and is based on the amount that would be due to us pursuant to the fund partnership agreement at each period end as if the funds were liquidated at such date. Accordingly, the amount of carried interest recognized as performance allocations reflects our share of the fair value gains and losses of the associated\nIn addition, in our discussion of our non-GAAP results, we use the term realized net performance revenues\u201d to refer to realized performance allocations and incentive fees from our funds, net of the portion allocated to our investment professionals, if any, and certain tax expenses associated with carried interest attributable to certain partners and employees, which are reflected as realized performance allocations and incentive fees related compensation expense. See - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for the amount of realized performance revenues recognized each period. See - Segment Analysis\u201d for the realized performance revenues by segment and related discussion for each period.\nDistributable Earnings\n(8) As used herein, \u2018Main Funds' are each comprised of (i) an anchor mandate(s) (i.e., generally the largest account(s) within a strategy's investment program) and (ii) AlpInvest's other advisory client mandates with investment periods that fall within the relevant investment periods under the mandate of the anchor mandate(s) (but do not overlap with more than one such investment period). AlpInvest's commingled funds, AlpInvest Secondaries Fund VI ( ASF VI\u201d), ASF VII and AlpInvest Co-Investment Fund VII ( ACF VII\u201d) are part of the Main Funds. Mezzanine Main Funds include mezzanine investments across all strategies (i.e., Primary Funds, Secondaries, and Co-Investments).\nFund management fees include transaction and portfolio advisory fees, net of rebate offsets, of $50.8 million, $49.1 million, and $50.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n(1) Represents the original cost of investments since inception of the fund.\nThe current unfunded commitment of Carlyle and our senior Carlyle professionals, operating executives and other professionals to our investment funds as of December 31, 2020, consisted of the following:\nFee-earning AUM was $35.2 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $7.9 billion, or 29%, compared to $27.3 billion at December 31, 2017. Driving the increase were inflows of $9.2 billion primarily attributable to the acquisition of Carlyle Aviation Partners and new fee-paying capital raised in our U.S. and Europe CLO's. Partially offsetting the increase were $1.2 billion of outflows primarily related to runoff of our CLO collateral balances as well as distributions from carry funds outside the investment period.\n\nFee-earning AUM as of and for each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2020\n\n(2)Outflows represents the impact of realizations from vehicles with management fees based on remaining invested capital at cost or fair value, changes in basis for funds where the investment period, weighted-average investment period or commitment fee period has expired during the period, and reductions for funds that are no longer calling for fees. Distributions for funds earning management fees based on commitments during the period do not affect Fee-earning AUM.\n(4)Foreign Exchange represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated funds. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the period end.\n(1) Excludes our strategic equity method investment in NGP Management and investments in NGP general partners - accrued performance allocations.\n(e)These obligations generally represent commitments by us to fund a portion of the purchase price paid for each investment made by our funds. Commitments to the funds are generally due on demand and are therefore presented in the less than one year category. A substantial majority of these investments is expected to be funded by senior Carlyle professionals and other professionals through our internal co-investment program. Of the $3.5 billion of unfunded commitments to the funds, approximately $3.0 billion is subscribed individually by senior Carlyle professionals, advisors and other professionals, with the balance funded directly by the Company.\nTotal AUM was $45.7 billion as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $0.6 billion, or 1%, compared to $46.3 billion as of December 31, 2017. Driving this decrease were $9.5 billion of outflows primarily due to distributions in our AlpInvest funds and $1.7 billion of foreign exchange losses related to the translation of our AlpInvest AUM from EUR to USD. Offsetting the decrease were $4.1 billion of inflows from new commitments raised in our AlpInvest and MRE funds, and $6.5 billion of market and other activity. Market appreciation was driven by 19% appreciation in our AlpInvest funds and 8% appreciation in our MRE funds.\n\n(c)These obligations represent our estimate of amounts to be paid on the contingent cash and other obligations associated with our acquisition of Carlyle Aviation Partners (see Note 3) and other obligations, as well as the deferred payment obligations described below. In connection with the Conversion, former holders of Carlyle Holdings partnership units will receive cash payments aggregating to approximately $344 million, which is equivalent to $1.50 per Carlyle Holdings partnership unit exchanged in the Conversion, payable in five annual installments of $0.30, the first of which occurred during the first quarter of 2020. The payment obligations are unsecured obligations of the Company or a subsidiary thereof, subordinated in right of payment to indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries, and do not bear interest.\n\nInterest. Interest increased $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to interest accrued on the 3.500% Senior Notes issued in September 2019. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nThe following table presents our results of operations for our Global Credit segment:\n\u2022provide capital to facilitate our expansion into new, complementary business lines, including acquisitions;\nCash-based compensation and benefits expense. Cash-based compensation and benefits expense decreased $8.7 million, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to lower cash bonuses as a result of decreased headcount. Cash-based compensation and benefits expense increased $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to higher cash bonuses in 2019.\nExpenses\nThe Company recognizes equity-based award forfeitures in the period they occur as a reversal of previously recognized compensation expense.\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, using currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period in which the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nFund management fees exclude the reimbursement of any partnership expenses paid by the Company on behalf of the Carlyle funds pursuant to the limited partnership agreements, including amounts related to the pursuit of actual, proposed, or unconsummated investments, professional fees, expenses associated with the acquisition, holding and disposition of investments, and other fund administrative expenses.\nThe Conversion resulted in a step-up in the tax basis of certain assets that will be recovered as those assets are sold or the basis is amortized. We recorded an estimated net deferred tax asset of $262.1 million relating to this step-up in tax basis. The Conversion and subsequent exchange of Carlyle Holdings units for an equivalent number of shares of common stock of the Company also resulted in an estimated net reduction of the deferred tax asset of $388.1 million. This amount was generated by: (1) deferred tax liabilities on investments and accrued performance revenue allocations, net of related compensation, which were not previously subject to U.S. corporate income tax, (2) an increase in the historical net deferred tax assets reflecting deferred tax amounts previously allocated to private unitholders, and (3) a decrease in the historical net deferred tax assets reflecting the impact of reducing our effective state tax rate under the corporate structure. Together with the estimated step-up in tax basis, the Conversion resulted in an estimated net reduction to the Company's net deferred tax asset of $126.0 million due to the Conversion. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding the Conversion.\nThe following tables reflect the performance of our significant funds in our Investment Solutions business.\n\u2022pay income taxes, including corporate income taxes;\nAssets under Management.

If, at December 31, 2020, all of the investments held by the Company's funds were deemed worthless, a possibility that management views as remote, the amount of realized and distributed carried interest subject to potential giveback would be $0.5 billion, on an after-tax basis where applicable.\nTotal expenses increased $213.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, and increased $48.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. The following table provides the components of the changes in total expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTotal assets were $15.6 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $1.8 billion from December 31, 2019. The increase in total assets was primarily attributable to increases in Investments of consolidated funds of $1.0 billion due to the formation of two CLOs during the year ended December 31, 2020, partially offset by the deconsolidation of the Renewable Energy fund. The increase in total assets was also driven by a $576.5 million increase in investments, including accrued performance allocations, as well as a $157.3 million increase in our lease right-of-use assets, net resulting from the start of our lease of our new New York office space in December 2020.\nFor additional information related to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, see -Financial regulatory changes in the United States could adversely affect our business and the possibility of increased regulatory focus could result in additional burdens and expenses on our business\u201d within Item 1A.\n\u2022Global Credit - Our Global Credit segment advises a group of 71 funds that pursue investment strategies including loans and structured credit, direct lending, opportunistic credit, distressed credit, and aircraft financing and servicing. As of December 31, 2020, our Global Credit segment had $55.9 billion in AUM and $42.1 billion in Fee-earning AUM.\n(3)Market Activity & Other represents realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments in our carry funds based on the lower of cost or fair value and net asset value, as well as activity of funds with fees based on gross asset value.\n(3) Our primary and secondary investments in external funds are generally valued based on the proportionate share of the net assets provided by third party general partners of the underlying fund partnership based on the most recent available information which typically has a lag of up to 90 days. As a result, amounts presented may not include the impact of economic activity in the current quarter.\nThe table below provides the period to period rollforward of Total AUM.\n\nFund Performance Metrics\n(a) the aggregate fair value of our carry funds and related co-investment vehicles, NGP Predecessor Funds and separately managed accounts, plus the capital that Carlyle is entitled to call from investors in those funds and vehicles (including Carlyle commitments to those funds and vehicles and those of senior Carlyle professionals and employees) pursuant to the terms of their capital commitments to those funds and vehicles;\n(2) Adjusted unrealized principal investment income (loss) from the investment in Fortitude Re represents 19.9% of Fortitude Holdings' estimated net income (loss) for the respective periods through June 2, 2020, excluding the unrealized gains (losses) related to embedded derivatives.\n\nThe near-term outlook for oil and gas is expected to improve in 2021 as lockdowns are eased and fuel demand rebounds. The long-term outlook for oil and gas will be more dependent on the pace of the broader shift to alternative energy sources. For example, currently over 90% of surface, air and marine transportation is powered by oil-based fuels. While growth in electric vehicle sales should cause this share to decline over time, electric vehicles account for less than 3% of new auto sales, and less than 0.5% of the cars on the road today are fully electric. Additionally, ongoing concerns about climate change and carbon emissions may dampen investor interest in the oil and gas sector which could have a negative impact on our activities in the sector including raising capital, obtaining suitable or sufficient financing, exiting investments and achieving expected returns on new investments.\nWe include in our calculation of AUM and Fee-earning AUM certain energy and renewable resources funds that we jointly advise with Riverstone Holdings L.L.C. ( Riverstone\u201d) and the NGP Energy Funds that are advised by NGP.\n(3)Market Activity & Other generally represents realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments in our carry funds and related co-investment vehicles, the NGP Predecessor Funds and separately managed accounts, as well as the net impact of fees, expenses and non-investment income, and other changes in AUM.\nOther Contingencies\nThe following table sets forth our total segment revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nFund Management Fees. Fund management fees include management fees and transaction and portfolio advisory fees. We earn management fees for advisory services we provide to funds in which we hold a general partner interest or with which we have an investment advisory or investment management agreement. Additionally, management fees include catch-up management fees, which are episodic in nature and represent management fees charged to fund investors in subsequent closings of a fund which apply to the time period between the fee initiation date and the subsequent closing date. Approximately 90% of our fee revenue is in the form of management fees from traditional closed-end, long-dated funds, which are highly predictable and stable, and do not have significant exposure to the underlying fund valuations.\n(5) Adjustments to performance revenues and principal investment income (loss) relate to (i) unrealized performance allocations net of related compensation expense and unrealized principal investment income, which are excluded from our Non-GAAP results, (ii) amounts earned from the Consolidated Funds, which were eliminated in the U.S. GAAP consolidation but were included in the Non-GAAP results, (iii) amounts attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated entities, which were excluded from the Non-GAAP results, (iv) the reclassification of NGP performance revenues, which are included in investment income in the U.S. GAAP financial statements, (v) the reclassification of certain incentive fees from business development companies, which are included in fund management fees in the Non-GAAP results, and (vi) the reclassification of certain tax expenses associated with performance revenues. Adjustments to principal investment income (loss) also include the reclassification of earnings for the investment in NGP Management and its affiliates to the appropriate operating captions for the Non-GAAP results, and the exclusion of charges associated with the investment in NGP Management and its affiliates that are excluded from the Non-GAAP results (see Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements).\nThe table below details Fee-earning AUM by its respective components at each period.\nFee Revenues. Total fee revenues increased $36.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 and increased $72.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, due to the following:\n(2)Outflows represents the impact of realizations from vehicles with management fees based on remaining invested capital at cost or fair value, changes in basis for funds where the investment period, weighted-average investment period or commitment fee period has expired during the period, reductions for funds that are no longer calling for fees, and gross redemptions in open-ended vehicles with management fees based on net asset value. Realizations for funds earning management fees based on commitments during the period do not affect Fee-earning AUM.\nNon-controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities. Non-controlling interests in consolidated entities represent the component of equity in consolidated entities not held by us. These interests are adjusted for general partner allocations.\n\n(b)the remaining amount of limited partner invested capital at cost, generally for carry funds and certain co-investment vehicles where the original investment period has expired, Metropolitan carry funds after the expiration of the weighted-average investment period of the underlying funds, and one of our business development companies (see Fee-earning AUM based on invested capital\u201d in the table below for the amount of this component at each period);\n(4)Foreign Exchange represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated funds. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the period end.\nFee Related Earnings\nThe following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 on a consolidated basis and on a basis excluding the obligations of the Consolidated Funds:\n\nWe have historically required limited capital resources to support the working capital and operating needs of our business. Our management fees have largely covered our operating costs and all realized performance allocations, after covering the related compensation, are available for distribution to equityholders. Approximately 95% - 97% of all capital commitments to our funds have been provided by our fund investors, with the remaining amount typically funded by our senior Carlyle professionals, advisors and other professionals.\nSince our inception through December 31, 2020, we and our senior Carlyle professionals, operating executives and other professionals have invested or committed to invest in or alongside our funds. Approximately 3% to 5% of all capital commitments to our funds are funded collectively by us and our senior Carlyle professionals, operating executives and other professionals.\n(13) For purposes of aggregation, funds that report in foreign currency have been converted to U.S. dollars at the reporting period spot rate.\n\nThe table below provides the period to period rollforward of Total AUM.\nIn the absence of observable market prices, the Company values its investments using valuation methodologies applied on a consistent basis. For some investments little market activity may exist. Management's determination of fair value is then based on the best information available in the circumstances and may incorporate management's own assumptions and involves a significant degree of judgment, taking into consideration a combination of internal and external factors, including the appropriate risk adjustments for non-performance and liquidity risks. Investments for which market prices are not observable include private investments in the equity of operating companies and real estate properties, and certain debt positions. The valuation technique for each of these investments is described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\nThe table below provides the period to period rollforward of Fee-earning AUM.\nFee-earning AUM was $91.6 billion at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $3.2 billion, or 3%, compared to $94.8 billion at December 31, 2019. This was driven by outflows of $9.5 billion which were principally a result of dispositions in our U.S. Buyout, NGP Energy, and Legacy Energy funds, as well as distributions in other funds outside of their investment period. Partially offsetting this were inflows of $5.4 billion primarily related to the activation of management fees in CJP IV, subscriptions in CPI, and new fee-paying commitments raised in various other funds. Also offsetting the decrease was positive foreign exchange activity of $1.2 billion from the translation of our Europe buyout, growth, and real estate AUM from EUR to USD. Investment and distribution activity by funds still in the investment period does not impact Fee-earning AUM as these funds are based on commitments.\nDecember 31, 2020 at their then current fair values. These assets and liabilities will continue to fluctuate in accordance with the fair values of the fund investments until they are realized. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $10.6 million of the accrued giveback obligation is the responsibility of various current and former senior Carlyle professionals and other limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships, and the net accrued giveback obligation attributable to Carlyle Holdings is $8.1 million. The Company uses net accrued performance revenues\u201d to refer to the aggregation of the accrued performance allocations and incentive fees net of (i) accrued giveback obligations, (ii) accrued performance allocations and incentive fee-related compensation, (iii) performance allocations and incentive fee-related tax obligations, and (iv) accrued performance allocations and incentive fees attributable to non-controlling interests and excludes any net accrued performance allocations and incentive fees that hav
