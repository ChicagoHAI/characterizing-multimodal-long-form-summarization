MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIntroduction\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with ITEM 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\u201d Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nTPG Specialty Lending, Inc. is a Delaware corporation formed on July 21, 2010. The Adviser is our external manager. We have three wholly owned subsidiaries, TC Lending, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which holds a California finance lender and broker license, TPG SL SPV, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, in which we hold assets that were previously used to support our asset-backed credit facility, and TSL MR, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, in which we hold certain investments.\nWe have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and as a RIC under the Code. We made our BDC election on April 15, 2011. As a result, we are required to comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements, such as:\nTable 218: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the requirement to invest at least 70% of our assets in qualifying assets\u201d;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> source of income limitations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> asset diversification requirements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the requirement to distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year at least 90% of our investment company taxable income and tax-exempt interest for that taxable year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur shares are currently listed on the NYSE under the symbol TSLX.\u201d\nWe have in place a stock repurchase plan, the Company 10b5-1 Plan, to acquire up to $50 million in the aggregate of our common stock at prices below our net asset value per share over a specified period, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. We put the Company 10b5-1 Plan in place because we believe that if our common stock is trading below our then-current net asset value, it is in the best interest of our stockholders for us to reinvest in our portfolio and increase our leverage ratio through share repurchases.\nThe Company 10b5-1 Plan is designed to allow us to repurchase our common stock at times when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws. The Company 10b5-1 Plan requires Goldman, Sachs & Co., as our agent, to repurchase shares of common stock on our behalf when the market price per share is below the most recently reported net asset value per share (including any updates, corrections or adjustments publicly announced by us to any previously announced net asset value per share). Under the Company 10b5-1 Plan, the agent will increase the volume of purchases made as the price of our common stock declines, subject to volume restrictions. The timing and amount of any stock repurchases will depend on the terms and conditions of the Company 10b5-1 Plan, the market price of our common stock and trading volumes, and no assurance can be given that any particular amount of common stock will be repurchased.\nOn August 4, 2015, our Board authorized us to enter into a new stock repurchase plan, the Company 10b5-1 Plan, to acquire up to $50 million in the aggregate of our common stock at prices just below our net asset value over an initial six month period, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, and has continued to authorize extensions of the plan termination date prior to its expiration since that time. On February 21, 2018, the Board authorized the extension of the termination date of the Company 10b5-1 Plan to August 31, 2018. Unless extended or terminated by the Board, the Company 10b5-1 Plan will be in effect through the earlier of August 31, 2018 or such time as the current approved repurchase amount of up to $50 million has been fully utilized, subject to certain conditions.\nOur Investment Framework\nWe are a specialty finance company focused on lending to middle-market companies. Since we began our investment activities in July 2011, through December 31, 2017, we have originated more than $7.3 billion aggregate principal amount of investments and retained approximately $4.4 billion aggregate principal amount of these investments on our balance sheet prior to any subsequent exits and repayments. We seek to generate current income primarily in U.S.-domiciled middle-market companies through direct originations of senior secured loans and, to a lesser extent, originations of mezzanine and unsecured loans and investments in corporate bonds and equity securities.\nBy middle-market companies,\u201d we mean companies that have annual EBITDA, which we believe is a useful proxy for cash flow, of $10 million to $250 million, although we may invest in larger or smaller companies on occasion. As of December 31, 2017, our core portfolio companies, which excludes certain investments that fall outside of our typical borrower profile and represent 83.2% of our total investments based on fair value, had weighted average annual revenue of $130.3 million and weighted average annual EBITDA of $25.1 million.\nWe invest in first-lien debt, second-lien debt, mezzanine and unsecured debt and equity and other investments. Our first-lien debt may include stand-alone first-lien loans; last out\u201d first-lien loans, which are loans that have a secondary priority behind super-senior first out\u201d first-lien loans; unitranche\u201d loans, which are loans that combine features of first-lien, second-lien and mezzanine debt, generally in a first-lien position; and secured corporate bonds with similar features to these categories of first-lien loans. Our second-lien debt may include secured loans, and, to a lesser extent, secured corporate bonds, with a secondary priority behind first-lien debt.\nThe debt in which we invest typically is not rated by any rating agency, but if these instruments were rated, they would likely receive a rating of below investment grade (that is, below BBB- or Baa3), which is often referred to as junk.\u201d\nThe companies in which we invest use our capital to support organic growth, acquisitions, market or product expansion and recapitalizations (including restructurings). As of December 31, 2017, the largest single investment based on fair value represented 6.7% of our total investment portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the average investment size in each of our portfolio companies was approximately $37.6 million based on fair value.\nThrough our Adviser, we consider potential investments utilizing a four-tiered investment framework and against our existing portfolio as a whole:\nBusiness and sector selection. We focus on companies with enterprise value between $50 million and $1 billion. When reviewing potential investments, we seek to invest in businesses with high marginal cash flow, recurring revenue streams and where we believe credit quality will improve over time. We look for portfolio companies that we think have a sustainable competitive advantage in growing industries or distressed situations. We also seek companies where our investment will have a low loan-to-value ratio.\nWe currently do not limit our focus to any specific industry and we may invest in larger or smaller companies on occasion. We classify the industries of our portfolio companies by end-market (such as healthcare, and business services) and not by the products or services (such as software) directed to those end-markets.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the largest industry represented 14.0% of our total investment portfolio based on fair value.\nInvestment Structuring. We focus on investing at the top of the capital structure and protecting that position. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 97.0% of our portfolio was invested in secured debt, including 93.4% in first-lien debt investments. We carefully perform diligence and structure investments to include strong investor covenants. As a result, we structure investments with a view to creating opportunities for early intervention in the event of non-performance or stress. In addition, we seek to retain effective voting control in investments over the loans or particular class of securities in which we invest through maintaining affirmative voting positions or negotiating consent rights that allow us to retain a blocking position. We also aim for our loans to mature on a medium term, between two to six years after origination. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the weighted average term on new investment commitments in new portfolio companies was 4.2 years.\nDeal Dynamics. We focus on, among other deal dynamics, direct origination of investments, where we identify and lead the investment transaction. A substantial majority of our portfolio investments are sourced through our direct or proprietary relationships.\nRisk Mitigation. We seek to mitigate non-credit-related risk on our returns in several ways, including call protection provisions to protect future interest income. As of December 31, 2017, we had call protection on 91.2% of our debt investments based on fair value, with weighted average call prices of 106.2% for the first year, 103.2% for the second year and 101.4% for the third year, in each case from the date of the initial investment. As of December 31, 2017, 100.0% of our debt investments based on fair value bore interest at floating rates (when including investment specific hedges), with 93.3% of these subject to interest rate floors, which we believe helps act as a portfolio-wide hedge against inflation.\nRelationship with our Adviser, TSSP and TPG\nOur Adviser is a Delaware limited liability company. Our Adviser acts as our investment adviser and administrator and is a registered investment adviser with the SEC under the Advisers Act. Our Adviser sources and manages our portfolio through a dedicated team of investment professionals predominately focused on us. Our Investment Team is led by our Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer and our Adviser's Co-Chief Investment Officer Joshua Easterly and our Adviser's Co-Chief Investment Officer Alan Waxman, both of whom have substantial experience in credit origination, underwriting and asset management. Our investment decisions are made by our Investment Review Committee, which includes senior personnel of our Adviser and TPG Sixth Street Partners, or TSSP.\nTSSP, with approximately $20 billion of assets under management as of September 30, 2017, is TPG's special situations and credit platform and encompasses TPG Specialty Lending, TPG Opportunities Partners and TSSP Adjacent Opportunities Partners, which invest in special situations and distressed investments across the credit cycle, TSL Europe, which is aimed at European middle-market loan originations, and TPG Institutional Credit Partners, which is a public-side\u201d credit investment platform focused on investment opportunities in broadly syndicated leveraged loan markets. TSSP has extensive experience with highly complex, global public and private investments executed through primary originations, secondary market purchases and restructurings, and has a team of over 180 investment and operating professionals. As of December 31, 2017, thirty one (31) of these personnel are dedicated to our business, including twenty four (24) investment professionals.\nOur Adviser consults with TSSP and TPG in connection with a substantial number of our investments. The TSSP and TPG platforms provide us with a breadth of large and scalable investment resources. We believe we benefit from their market expertise, insights into sector and macroeconomic trends and intensive due diligence capabilities, which help us discern market conditions that vary across industries and credit cycles, identify favorable investment opportunities and manage our portfolio of investments. TSSP and TPG will refer all middle-market loan origination activities for companies domiciled in the United States to us and conduct those activities through us. The Adviser will determine whether it would be permissible, advisable or otherwise appropriate for us to pursue a particular investment opportunity allocated to us by TSSP and TPG.\nOn December 16, 2014, we were granted an exemptive order from the SEC that allows us to co-invest, subject to certain conditions and to the extent the size of an investment opportunity exceeds the amount our Adviser has independently determined is appropriate to invest, with affiliates of TSSP and TPG in middle-market loan origination activities for companies domiciled in the United States and certain follow-on\u201d investments in companies in which we have already co-invested pursuant to the order and remain invested.\nWe believe our ability to co-invest with TSSP and TPG affiliates is particularly useful where we identify larger capital commitments than otherwise would be appropriate for us. We expect that with the ability to co-invest with TSSP and TPG affiliates we will continue to be able to provide one-stop\u201d financing to a potential portfolio company in these circumstances, which may allow us to capture opportunities where we alone could not commit the full amount of required capital or would have to spend additional time to locate unaffiliated co-investors.\nUnder the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement, the Adviser's services are not exclusive, and the Adviser is free to furnish similar or other services to others, so long as its services to us are not impaired. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, we will pay the Adviser the base management fee, or the Management Fee, and may also pay certain incentive fees, or the Incentive Fees.\nUnder the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Adviser also provides administrative services to us. These services include providing office space, equipment and office services, maintaining financial records, preparing reports to stockholders and reports filed with the SEC, and managing the payment of expenses and the oversight of the performance of administrative and professional services rendered by others. Certain of these services are reimbursable to the Adviser under the terms of the Administration Agreement.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nInvestments\nWe focus primarily on the direct origination of loans to middle-market companies domiciled in the United States.\nOur level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital generally available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make.\nIn addition, as part of our risk strategy on investments, we may reduce certain levels of investments through partial sales or syndication to additional investors.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate income from dividends on direct equity investments, capital gains on the sale of investments and various loan origination and other fees. Our debt investments typically have a term of two to six years, and, as of December 31, 2017, 100.0% of these investments based on fair value bore interest at a floating rate (when including investment specific hedges), with 93.3% of these subject to interest rate floors. Interest on debt investments is generally payable quarterly or semiannually. Some of our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. For the year ended December 31, 2017, 2.8% of our total investment income was comprised of PIK interest.\nChanges in our net investment income are primarily driven by the spread between the payments we receive from our investments in our portfolio companies against our cost of funding, rather than by changes in interest rates. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of floating rate loans, and our credit facilities and Convertible Senior Notes, after taking into account the effect of the interest rate swaps we have entered into in connection with the Convertible Senior Notes, all bear interest at floating rates. Macro trends in base interest rates like LIBOR may affect our net investment income over the long term. However, because we generally originate loans to a small number of portfolio companies each quarter, and those investments also vary in size, our results in any given period-including the interest rate on investments that were sold or repaid in a period compared to the interest rate of new investments made during that period-often are idiosyncratic, and reflect the characteristics of the particular portfolio companies that we invested in or exited during the period and not necessarily any trends in our business.\nIn addition to interest income, our net investment income is also driven by prepayment and other fees, which also can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. The level of prepayment fees is generally correlated to the movement in credit spreads and risk premiums, but also will vary based on corporate events that may take place at an individual portfolio company in a given period-e.g., merger and acquisition activity, initial public offerings and restructurings. As noted above, generally a small but varied number of portfolio companies may make prepayments in any quarter, meaning that changes in the amount of prepayment fees received can vary significantly between periods and can vary without regard to underlying credit trends.\nLoan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income using the effective interest method for term instruments and the straight-line method for revolving or delayed draw instruments. Repayments of our debt investments can reduce interest income from period to period. We record prepayment premiums on loans as interest income when earned. We also may generate revenue in the form of commitment, amendment, structuring, syndication or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. The frequency or volume of these repayments may fluctuate significantly.\nDividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies.\nOur portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of investments. We recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to our Adviser under the Investment Advisory Agreement, expenses reimbursable under the Administration Agreement and other operating costs described below. Additionally, we pay interest expense on our outstanding debt. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including those relating to:\nTable 222: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> calculating individual asset values and our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firms);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> expenses, including travel expenses, incurred by the Adviser, or members of our Investment Team, or payable to third parties, in respect of due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and, if necessary, in respect of enforcing our rights with respect to investments in existing portfolio companies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of any public offerings of our common stock and other securities, including registration and listing fees;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the Management Fee and any Incentive Fee;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> certain costs and expenses relating to distributions paid on our shares;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> administration fees payable under our Administration Agreement;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 228: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs of preparing financial statements and maintaining books and records and filing reports or other documents with the SEC (or other regulatory bodies) and other reporting and compliance costs, and the compensation of professionals responsible for the preparation of the foregoing, including the allocable portion of the compensation of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other professionals who spend time on those related activities (based on the percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 229: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 230: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the Adviser's allocable share of costs incurred in providing significant managerial assistance to those portfolio companies that request it;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> amounts payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making or holding investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> transfer agent and custodial fees;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs of hedging;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 234: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> commissions and other compensation payable to brokers or dealers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 235: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> taxes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 236: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Independent Director fees and expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our stockholders (including printing and mailing costs), the costs of any stockholders' meetings and the compensation of investor relations personnel responsible for the preparation of the foregoing and related matters;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 238: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our fidelity bond;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 239: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 240: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> indemnification payments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 241: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> direct costs and expenses of administration, including audit, accounting, consulting and legal costs; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 242: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> all other expenses reasonably incurred by us in connection with making investments and administering our business.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect that during periods of asset growth, our general and administrative expenses will be relatively stable or will decline as a percentage of total assets, and will increase as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset declines.\nLeverage\nWhile as a BDC the amount of leverage that we are permitted to use is limited in significant respects, we use leverage to increase our ability to make investments. The amount of leverage we use in any period depends on a variety of factors, including cash available for investing, the cost of financing and general economic and market conditions, however, our total borrowings are limited so that our asset coverage ratio cannot fall below 200% immediately after any borrowing, as defined in the 1940 Act. In any period, our interest expense will depend largely on the extent of our borrowing and we expect interest expense will increase as we increase leverage over time within the limits of the 1940 Act. In addition, we may dedicate assets as collateral to financing facilities from time to time.\nMarket Trends\nWe believe trends in the middle-market lending environment, including the limited availability of capital, strong demand for debt capital and specialized lending requirements, are likely to continue to create favorable opportunities for us to invest at attractive risk-adjusted rates.\nThe limited number of dedicated providers of capital to middle-market companies, combined with increases in required capital levels for regulated financial institutions, reduces the capacity of traditional lenders to serve middle-market companies. We believe that the limited availability of capital creates a significant opportunity for us to directly originate investments. We also believe that the large amount of uninvested capital held by private equity firms will continue to drive deal activity, which may in turn create additional demand for debt capital.\nThe limited number of providers is further exacerbated by the specialized due diligence and underwriting capabilities, as well as extensive ongoing monitoring, required for middle-market lending. We believe middle-market lending is generally more labor-intensive than lending to larger companies due to smaller investment sizes and the lack of publicly available information on these companies.\nAn imbalance between the supply of, and demand for, middle-market debt capital creates attractive pricing dynamics for investors such as BDCs. The negotiated nature of middle-market financings also generally provides for more favorable terms to the lenders, including stronger covenant and reporting packages, better call protection and lender-protective change of control provisions. We believe that BDCs have flexibility to develop loans that reflect each borrower's distinct situation, provide long-term relationships and a potential source for future capital, which renders BDCs, including us, attractive lenders.\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nAs of December 31, 2017, our portfolio based on fair value consisted of 93.4% first-lien debt investments, 3.6% second-lien debt investments, and 3.0% equity and other investments. As of December 31, 2016, our portfolio based on fair value consisted of 96.5% first-lien debt investments, 1.2% second-lien debt investments, 0.6% mezzanine and unsecured debt investments, and 1.7% equity and other investments.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, our weighted average total yield of debt and income producing securities at fair value (which includes interest income and amortization of fees and discounts) was 10.7% and 10.4%, respectively, and our weighted average total yield of debt and income-producing securities at amortized cost (which includes interest income and amortization of fees and discounts) was 10.8% and 10.4%, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had investments in 45 and 52 portfolio companies, respectively, with an aggregate fair value of $1,693.7 million and $1,657.4 million, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we made new investment commitments of $1,072.6 million in 22 new portfolio companies and 12 existing portfolio companies. For this period, we had $951.5 million aggregate principal amount in exits and repayments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we made new investment commitments of $562.7 million in 14 new portfolio companies and 9 existing portfolio companies. For this period, we had $416.5 million aggregate principal amount in exits and repayments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we made new investment commitments of $718.7 million in 20 new portfolio companies and 14 existing portfolio companies. For this period, we had $385.2 million aggregate principal amount in exits and repayments.\nOur investment activity for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 is presented below (information presented herein is at par value unless otherwise indicated).\nTable 243: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in

Dividend income increased from $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to owning our dividend yielding investments for a full calendar year. Other income increased from $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to higher syndication, amendment and agency fees earned during 2016.\nExpenses\nOperating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 265: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Management fees (net of waivers)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Incentive fees related to pre-incentive fee net investment\nincome (net of waivers)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Incentive fees related to realized/unrealized capital gains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Directors fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 87.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 82.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest\nInterest expense, including other debt financing expenses, increased from $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $27.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the average 1-month LIBOR rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 0.5% to 1.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and an increase in our average interest rate on debt outstanding due to a change in the mix of our debt financing sources. The average interest rate on our debt outstanding increased from 2.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 3.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the increase in LIBOR and a change in the mix of our debt financing sources.\nInterest expense, including other debt financing expenses, increased from $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average debt outstanding from $540.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $725.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as well an increase in the average 1-month LIBOR rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 0.20% to 0.50% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The average interest rate on our debt outstanding increased from 2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 2.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the increase in LIBOR.\nManagement Fees\nManagement Fees (net of waivers) increased from $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Management Fees remained flat at $24.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017 due to total assets remaining $1.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017. Management Fees waived decreased from $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to owning investments subject to fee waivers for a shorter period in 2017 than 2016. Management Fees waived during the year ended December 31, 2016 were solely attributable to our ownership of TICC Shares. Management Fees waived during the year ended December 31, 2017 were solely attributable to our ownership of TCAP Shares.\nManagement Fees (net of waivers) increased from $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Management Fees increased from $21.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the increase in total assets, which increased from an average of $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 to an average of $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. Management Fees waived for both the year ended December 31, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2016 were $0.1 million. Management Fees waived during the year ended December 31, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2016 were solely attributable to our ownership of shares of common stock in the TICC Shares.\nThe Adviser has voluntarily waived the Management Fee on our ownership of the TCAP Shares for any period in which Triangle Capital Corp. remains our portfolio company. Any waived Management Fees are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser. For the period ended December 31, 2016 and prior, the Adviser voluntarily waived the Management Fee on our ownership of the TICC Shares. Any waived Management Fees are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser. Following our IPO, with the exception of its waiver of Management Fees attributable to our ownership of the TCAP Shares and TICC Shares, the Adviser has not waived its right to receive the full Management Fee payable pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement.\nIncentive Fees\nIncentive Fees (net of waivers) related to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income increased from $22.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase resulted from an increase in interest from investments received during the year ended December 31, 2017 and the related increase in net investment income. Incentive Fees waived related to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income decreased from $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, consisting solely of Incentive Fees attributable to our ownership of the TICC Shares for the year ended December 31, 2016 and to our ownership of the TCAP Shares for the year ended December 31, 2017. There were no Incentive Fees related to capital gains and losses for the year ended December 31, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2017 due to realized and unrealized losses on our investments.\nIncentive Fees (net of waivers) related to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income increased from $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $22.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase resulted from the increase in the size of the portfolio and related increase in net investment income. Incentive Fees waived related to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income increased from $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, consisting solely of Incentive Fees attributable to our ownership of the TICC Shares. There were no Incentive Fees related to capital gains and losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2016 due to realized and unrealized losses on our investments.\nFor the periods December 31, 2016 and prior, the Adviser voluntarily waived the Incentive Fees attributable to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income accrued by us as a result of our ownership of the TICC Shares. The Adviser has not waived any part of the Incentive Fee related to capital gains and losses attributable to our ownership of the TICC Shares and, accordingly, any realized capital gains or losses and unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation with respect to the TICC Shares applies towards our cumulative realized capital gains on which the Incentive Fee related to capital gains and losses is calculated.\nIn addition, the Adviser voluntarily waived the Incentive Fees attributable to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income accrued by us as a result of our ownership of the TCAP Shares. The Adviser has not waived any part of the Incentive Fee related to capital gains and losses attributable to our ownership of the TCAP Shares and, accordingly, any realized capital gains or losses and unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation with respect to the TCAP Shares applies towards our cumulative realized capital gains on which the Incentive Fee related to capital gains and losses is calculated.\nAny waived Incentive Fees are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser.\nProfessional Fees and Other General and Administrative Expenses\nProfessional fees decreased from $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to additional professional fees incurred relating to our investment in the TICC Shares and related activity for the year ended December 31, 2016. Other general and administrative fees increased from $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nProfessional fees increased from $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to an increase in costs associated with servicing our investment portfolio, as well as additional professional fees incurred relating to our investment in the TICC Shares and related activity. Other general and administrative fees decreased from $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIncome Taxes, Including Excise Taxes\nWe have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our stockholders in each taxable year generally at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. To maintain our RIC status, we, among other things, have made and intend to continue to make the requisite distributions to our stockholders, which generally relieve us from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes.\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we can be expected to carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year dividend distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such income, we accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income.\nFor the calendar years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 we recorded a net expense of $2.8 million, $2.2 million and $1.5 million, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax.\nNet Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses\nThe following table summarizes our net realized and unrealized gains (losses) for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 266: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized losses on investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (14.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized gains on interest rate swaps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized gains (losses) on foreign currency transactions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized losses on foreign currency investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized gains on foreign currency borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (14.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in unrealized gains on investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 56.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in unrealized losses on investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (48.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (23.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (43.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Change in Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (34.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on foreign currency\nborrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on foreign\ncurrency cash and forward contracts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized depreciation on interest rate swaps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Change in Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Foreign\nCurrency Transactions and Interest Rate Swaps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (12.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Change in Unrealized Gains (Losses)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (28.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had net realized losses on investments of $14.3 million, $0.8 million and $5.0 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had net realized gains on interest rate swaps of $1.8 million. We did not have realized gains or losses on interest rate swaps for the years ended December 31, 2017 or 2016. For both the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2015, we had net realized gains on foreign currency transactions of less than $0.1 million, respectively, and net realized losses on foreign currency transactions of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of translating foreign currency related to our non-USD denominated investments. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had net realized losses on foreign currency investments of $4.9 million, $10.9 million, $0.4 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 we had net realized gains on foreign currency borrowings of $5.2 million, $11.8 million and $0.4 million, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 we had $66.7 million in unrealized appreciation on 43 portfolio company investments, which was offset by $48.9 million in unrealized depreciation on 32 portfolio company investments. Unrealized appreciation for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from an increase in fair value, primarily due to reversal of prior period unrealized depreciation, positive valuation adjustments and tightening credit spreads. Unrealized depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from the reversal of prior period unrealized appreciation on realized investments and in some instances negative credit-related adjustments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 we had $56.7 million in unrealized appreciation on 48 portfolio company investments, which was offset by $23.0 million in unrealized depreciation on 10 portfolio company investments. Unrealized appreciation for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted from an increase in fair value, primarily due to positive valuation adjustments and tightening credit spreads. Unrealized depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted from the reversal of prior period unrealized appreciation on realized investments and in some instances negative credit-related adjustments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 we had $9.0 million in unrealized appreciation on 15 portfolio company investments, which was offset by $43.3 million in unrealized depreciation on 40 portfolio company investments. Unrealized appreciation for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted from an increase in fair value, primarily due to positive valuation adjustments. Unrealized depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted from widening in credit spreads, the reversal of prior period unrealized appreciation and in some instances negative credit-related adjustments.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had unrealized depreciation on foreign currency borrowings of $11.5 million and $3.6 million, respectively, primarily as a result of fluctuations in the GBP and EUR exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2017 and GBP, SEK and EUR exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we\nhad unrealized appreciation on foreign currency borrowings of $6.3 million, primarily as a result of fluctuations in the GBP, SEK and EUR exchange rates. For both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had unrealized appreciation on foreign currency cash and forward contracts of less than $0.1 million, primarily as a result of settling our foreign currency forward contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had unrealized depreciation on foreign currency cash and forward contracts of less than $0.1 million, primarily as a result of settling our foreign currency forward contracts. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had unrealized depreciation on interest rate swaps of $1.0 million, $0.3 million, and $0.5 million, respectively, due to fluctuations in interest rates.\nRealized Gross Internal Rate of Return\nSince we began investing in 2011 through December 31, 2017, weighted by capital invested, our exited investments have generated an average realized gross internal rate of return to us of 18.8% (based on total capital invested of $2.6 billion and total proceeds from these exited investments of $3.2 billion). Eighty eight percent of these exited investments resulted in a realized gross internal rate of return to us of 10% or greater.\nGross IRR, with respect to an investment, is calculated based on the dates that we invested capital and dates we received distributions, regardless of when we made distributions to our stockholders. Initial investments are assumed to occur at time zero, and all cash flows are deemed to occur on the fifteenth of each month in which they occur.\nGross IRR reflects historical results relating to our past performance and is not necessarily indicative of our future results. In addition, gross IRR does not reflect the effect of Management Fees, expenses, Incentive Fees or taxes borne, or to be borne, by us or our stockholders, and would be lower if it did.\nAverage gross IRR is the average of the gross IRR for each of our exited investments (each calculated as described above), weighted by the total capital invested for each of those investments.\nAverage gross IRR on our exited investments reflects only invested and realized cash amounts as described above, and does not reflect any unrealized gains or losses in our portfolio.\nInternal rate of return, or IRR, is a measure of our discounted cash flows (inflows and outflows). Specifically, IRR is the discount rate at which the net present value of all cash flows is equal to zero. That is, IRR is the discount rate at which the present value of total capital invested in each of our investments is equal to the present value of all realized returns from that investment. Our IRR calculations are unaudited.\nCapital invested, with respect to an investment, represents the aggregate cost basis allocable to the realized or unrealized portion of the investment, net of any upfront fees paid at closing for the term loan portion of the investment. Capital invested also includes realized losses on hedging activity, with respect to an investment, which represents any inception-to-date realized losses on foreign currency forward contracts allocable to the investment, if any.\nRealized returns, with respect to an investment, represents the total cash received with respect to each investment, including all amortization payments, interest, dividends, prepayment fees, upfront fees (except upfront fees paid at closing for the term loan portion of an investment), administrative fees, agent fees, amendment fees, accrued interest, and other fees and proceeds. Realized returns also include realized gains on hedging activity, with respect to an investment, which represents any inception-to-date realized gains on foreign currency forward contracts allocable to the investment, if any.\nHedging\nOur current approach to hedging the foreign currency exposure in our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments is primarily to borrow the par amount in local currency under our Revolving Credit Facility to fund these investments. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had $11.5 million and $3.6 million of realized losses and $6.3 million of unrealized gains, respectively, on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated debt into U.S. dollars; such amounts approximate the corresponding unrealized gains and losses on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments into U.S. dollars for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. See Note 2 for additional disclosure regarding our accounting for foreign currency. See Note 7 for additional disclosure regarding the amounts of outstanding debt denominated in each foreign currency at December 31, 2017. See our consolidated schedule of investments for additional disclosure regarding the foreign currency amounts (in both par and fair value) of our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity and capital resources are derived primarily from proceeds from equity issuances, advances from our credit facilities, and cash flows from operations. The primary uses of our cash and cash equivalents are:\nTable 267: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> investments in portfolio companies and other investments and to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 268: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cost of operations (including paying our Adviser);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 269: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> debt service, repayment, and other financing costs; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 270: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> cash dividends to the holders of our shares.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe intend to continue to generate cash primarily from cash flows from operations, future borrowings and future offerings of securities. We may from time to time enter into additional debt facilities, increase the size of existing facilities or issue debt securities. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock if immediately after the borrowing or issuance the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock, is at least 200%. As of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our asset coverage ratio was 235.5%, 237.7%, and 225.7%, respectively. We carefully consider our unfunded commitments for the purpose of planning our capital resources and ongoing liquidity including our financial leverage. Further, we maintain sufficient borrowing capacity within the 200% asset coverage limitation to cover any outstanding unfunded commitments we are required to fund.\nCash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017, taken together with cash available under our credit facilities, is expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations in the near term. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $488.2 million of availability on our Revolving Credit Facility, subject to asset coverage limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $6.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we provided $82.4 million in cash for operating activities, primarily as a result of proceeds from investments of $103.6 million, repayments on investments of $922.5 million, and an increase in net assets resulting from operations of $111.6 million, which was partially offset by funding portfolio investments of $1,028.0 million and other operating activity of $27.3 million. Lastly, cash used in financing activities was $81.7 million during the period, primarily due to paydowns on our Revolving Credit Facility of $1,171.6 million, dividends paid of $94.7 million, and deferred financing costs of $3.9 million, which were partially offset by borrowings of $1,188.5 million (including the issuance of $115.0 million principal amount of our 2022 Convertible Senior Notes).\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $4.9 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we used $37.9 million in cash for operating activities, primarily as a result of funding portfolio investments of $720.7 million and other operating activity of $49.8 million, which was partially offset by proceeds from investments of $71.4 million, repayments on investments of $524.2 million, and an increase in net assets resulting from operations of $137.0 million. Lastly, cash provided by financing activities was $40.3 million during the period, primarily due to borrowings of $580.4 million and proceeds from issuance of common stock (net of purchases of treasury stock and offering and underwriting costs) of $76.9 million, partially offset by repayments on debt of $533.8 million, debt issuance costs of $2.9 million and dividends paid of $80.3 million.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $3.2 million of restricted cash pledged as collateral under our interest rate swap agreements, compared to $1.1 million as of December 31, 2016.\nEquity\nOn March 3, 2016, we issued 5,000,000 shares of common stock at $16.42 per share. Net of underwriting fees and offering costs, we received total cash proceeds of $78.3 million.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we also issued 530,996 and 638,326 shares of our common stock, respectively, to investors who have not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan for proceeds of $10.2 million and $10.3 million, respectively. On January 12, 2018, we issued 153,295 shares of our common stock through our dividend reinvestment plan for proceeds of $2.9 million, which is not reflected in the number of shares issued for the year ended December 31, 2017 in this section or the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOn November 3, 2014, the Board approved the Company 10b5-1 Plan to acquire up to $50 million in the aggregate of our common stock at prices just below our net asset value over a specified period, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. We put the Company 10b5-1 Plan in place because we believe that, in current market conditions, if our common stock is trading below our then-current net asset value, it is in the best interest of our stockholders for us to reinvest in our portfolio and increase our leverage ratio through share repurchases.\nThe Company 10b5-1 Plan is designed to allow us to repurchase our common stock at times when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws. The Company 10b5-1 Plan requires Goldman, Sachs & Co., as our agent, to repurchase shares of common stock on our behalf when the market price per share is below the most recently reported net asset value per share (including any updates, corrections or adjustments publicly announced by us to any previously announced net asset value per share). Under the Company 10b5-1 Plan, the agent will increase the volume of purchases made as the price of our common stock declines, subject to volume restrictions. The timing and amount of any stock repurchases will depend on the terms and conditions of the Company 10b5-1 Plan, the market price of our common stock and trading volumes, and no assurance can be given that any particular amount of common stock will be repurchased.\nThe purchase of shares pursuant to the Company 10b5-1 Plan is intended to satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, and will otherwise be subject to applicable law, including Regulation M, which may prohibit purchases under certain circumstances.\nThe Company 10b5-1 Plan expired in accordance with its terms on June 30, 2015. On August 4, 2015, the Board authorized us to enter into a new stock repurchase plan, on substantially the same terms as the prior stock repurchase plan, over an initial six month period, and has continued to authorize extensions of the plan termination date prior to its expiration since that time. On February 21, 2018, the Board authorized the extension of the termination date of the Company 10b5-1 Plan to August 31, 2018. Unless extended or terminated by the Board, the Company 10b5-1 Plan will be in effect through the earlier of August 31, 2018 or such time as the current approved repurchase amount of up to $50 million has been fully utilized, subject to certain conditions.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, no shares were repurchased under the Company 10b5-1 Plan. During the year ended December 31, 2016, 86,081 shares were repurchased under the Company 10b5-1 Plan at a weighted average price per share of $15.44, inclusive of commissions, for a total cost of $1.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, 2,000 shares were repurchased under the Company 10b5-1 Plan at a weighted average price per share of $14.44, inclusive of commissions, for a total cost of $28.9.\nDebt\nDebt obligations consisted of the following as of December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 271: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Aggregate Principal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Carrying\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount Committed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Principal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Available (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Value (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 975.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 486.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 488.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 479.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2019 Convertible Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 115.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 115.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 112.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2022 Convertible Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 115.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 115.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 111.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,205.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 716.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 488.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 703.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 272: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> The amount available reflects any limitations related to the respective debt facilities' borrowing bases.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 273: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> The carrying values of the Revolving Credit Facility and 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes are presented net of deferred financing costs of $7.1 million, $1.5 million and $3.2 million, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 274: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Aggregate Principal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Carrying\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount Committed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Principal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Available (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Value (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 945.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 578.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 366.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 569.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2019 Convertible Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 115.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 115.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 110.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,060.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 693.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 366.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 680.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 275: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> The amount available reflects any limitations related to the respective debt facilities' borrowing bases.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 276: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> The carrying values of the Revolving Credit Facility and 2019 Convertible Senior Notes are presented net of deferred financing costs of $8.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the terms of our debt arrangements. We intend to continue to utilize our credit facilities to fund investments and for other general corporate purposes.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn August 23, 2012, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement with SunTrust Bank, as administrative agent, and J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, and certain other lenders (as amended, the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d).\nAs of December 31, 2017, aggregate commitments under the facility were $975 million. The facility includes an uncommitted accordion feature that allows us, under certain circumstances, to increase the size of the facility to up to $1.25 billion.\nAs of December 31, 2017, with respect to $915 million in commitments, the revolving period, during which period we, subject to certain conditions, may make borrowings under the facility, ended December 22, 2020 and the stated maturity date was December 22, 2021. For the remaining $60 million of commitments, the revolving period ended October 2, 2019 and the stated maturity date was October 2, 2020.\nWe may borrow amounts in U.S. dollars or certain other permitted currencies. As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding debt denominated in Euro (EUR) of 59.4 million on our Revolving Credit Facility, included in the Outstanding Principal amount in the table above.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit up to an aggregate amount of $75 million. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had no outstanding letters of credit issued through the Revolving Credit Facility. The amount available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility is reduced by any letters of credit issued through the Revolving Credit Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2017, amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility, including amounts drawn in respect of letters of credit, bore interest at either LIBOR plus a margin of either 1.75% or 2.00%, or the prime rate plus a margin of either 0.75% or 1.00%, in each case, based on the total amount of the borrowing base relative to the sum of the total commitments (or, if greater, the total exposure) under the Revolving Credit Facility plus certain other designated secured debt. We may elect either the LIBOR or prime rate at the time of drawdown, and loans may be converted from one rate to another at any time, subject to certain conditions. We also pay a fee of 0.375% on undrawn amounts and, in respect of each undrawn letter of credit, a fee and interest rate equal to the then-applicable margin while the letter of credit is outstanding.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by TPG SL SPV, LLC, TC Lending, LLC and TSL MR, LLC and may be guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries in the future. The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a perfected first-priority security interest in substantially all the portfolio investments held by us and each guarantor. Proceeds from borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of portfolio investments.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility includes customary events of default, as well as customary covenants, including restrictions on certain distributions and financial covenants requiring:\nTable 277: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> an asset coverage ratio of no less than 2 to 1 on the last day of any fiscal quarter;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 278: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a liquidity test under which we must not maintain cash and liquid investments of less than 10% of the covered debt amount for more than 30 consecutive business days under circumstances where our adjusted covered debt balance is greater than 90% of our adjusted borrowing base under the facility; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 279: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> stockholders' equity of at least $500 million plus 25% of the net proceeds of the sale of equity interests after December 22, 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet proceeds received from our common stock issuance in March 2016, and net proceeds received from the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes and the 2023 Notes were used to pay down borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility.\nOn February 20, 2018, we entered into an amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility. Under the terms of the amendment, aggregate commitments under the facility were increased to $990 million. In addition, with respect to $895 million in commitments, amounts drawn under the facility bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of either 1.75% or 1.875%, or the prime rate plus a margin of either 0.75% or 0.875%. With respect to $95 million in commitments, amounts drawn under the facility bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of either 1.75% or 2.00%, or the prime rate plus a margin of either 0.75% or 1.00%.\nThe maturity of the facility was also extended. With respect to $895 million in commitments, the revolving period ends in February 2022 and the stated maturity date is February 2023. For the remaining $95 million of commitments, the revolving period ends in either October 2019 or December 2020, and the stated maturity date is either October 2020 or December 2021. Under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, we may at any time determine to cancel the commitments that were not extended.\n2019 Convertible Senior Notes\nIn June 2014, we issued in a private offering $115 million aggregate principal amount convertible senior notes due December 2019, or the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes. The 2019 Convertible Senior Notes were issued in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The 2019 Convertible Senior Notes are unsecured and bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year, payable semiannually. The 2019 Convertible Senior Notes will mature on December 15, 2019. In certain circumstances, the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election, at an initial conversion rate of 38.7162 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2019 Convertible Senior Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $25.83 per share of our common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. As of December 31, 2017, the estimated adjusted conversion price was approximately $25.41. The sale of the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes generated net proceeds of approximately $110.8 million. We used the net proceeds of the offering to pay down debt under the Revolving Credit Facility. In connection with the offering of 2019 Convertible Senior Notes, we have entered into interest rate swaps to continue to align the interest rates of our liabilities with our investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans. As a result of the swaps, our effective interest rate on the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 286 basis points.\nHolders may convert their 2019 Convertible Senior Notes at their option at any time prior to June 15, 2019 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2014 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period, or the measurement period, in which the trading price (as defined in the indenture governing the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes) per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.\nOn or after June 15, 2019 until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any of the foregoing circumstances.\n2022 Convertible Senior Notes\nIn February 2017, we issued in a private offering $115 million aggregate principal amount convertible senior notes due August 2022, or the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes. We refer to the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes and the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes collectively as the Convertible Senior Notes. The 2022 Convertible Senior Notes were issued in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The 2022 Convertible Senior Notes are unsecured, and bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year, payable semiannually. The 2022 Convertible Senior Notes will mature on August 1, 2022. In certain circumstances, the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election, at an initial conversion rate of 46.8516 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2022 Convertible Senior Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $21.34 per share of our common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. As of December 31, 2017, the estimated adjusted conversion price was approximately $21.15. The sale of the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes generated net proceeds of approximately $111.2 million. We used the net proceeds of the offering to pay down debt under the Revolving Credit Facility. In connection with the offering of 2022 Convertible Senior Notes, we have entered into an interest rate swap to continue to align the interest rates of our liabilities with our investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans. As a result of the swaps, our effective interest rate on the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 237.2 basis points.\nHolders may convert their 2022 Convertible Senior Notes at their option at any time prior to February 1, 2022 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2017 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period, or the measurement period, in which the trading price (as defined in the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes) per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after February 1, 2022 until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any of the foregoing circumstances.\nThe Convertible Senior Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to our future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Senior Notes; equal in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the principal amount of the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes exceeded the value of the underlying shares multiplied by the per share closing price of our common stock.\nThe indentures governing the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes contain certain covenants, including covenants requiring us to comply with the requirement under the 1940 Act that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the 1940 Act, equal at least 200% and to provide financial information to the holders of the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes under certain circumstances. These covenants are subject to important limitations and exceptions that are described in the indentures governing the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with the terms of the indentures governing the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes.\nThe Convertible Senior Notes are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 470-20. Upon conversion of any of the Convertible Senior Notes, we intend to pay the outstanding principal amount in cash and, to the extent that the conversion value exceeds the principal amount, we have the option to pay in cash or shares of our common stock (or a combination of cash and shares) in respect of the excess amount, subject to the requirements of the indentures governing the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes. We have determined that the embedded conversion options in the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes are not required to be separately accounted for as a derivative under U.S. GAAP. In accounting for the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes, we estimated at the time of issuance separate debt and equity components of the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes. An original issue discount equal to the equity components of the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes was recorded in additional paid-in capital\u201d in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the issuance costs associated with the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes were allocated to the debt and equity components in proportion to the allocation of the proceeds and accounted for as deferred financing costs and equity issuance costs, respectively.\n2023 Notes\nIn January 2018, we issued $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on January 22, 2023 (the 2023 Notes\u201d). The principal amount of the 2023 Notes is payable at maturity. The 2023 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year, payable semi-annually commencing on July 22, 2018, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option at any time at par plus a make whole\u201d premium. Total proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Notes, net of underwriting discounts and estimated offering costs, were approximately $147.1 million. We used the net proceeds of the 2023 Notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nIn connection with the offering, we entered into an interest rate swap to better align the interest rates of our liabilities with our investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans. As a result of the swap, our effective interest rate on the 2023 Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 199 basis points. The swap transaction matures on January 22, 2023.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nPortfolio Company Commitments\nFrom time to time, we may enter into commitments to fund investments. We incorporate these commitments into our assessment of our liquidity position. Our senior secured revolving loan commitments are generally available on a borrower's demand and may remain outstanding until the maturity date of the applicable loan. Our senior secured term loan commitments are generally available on a borrower's demand and, once drawn, generally have the same remaining term as the associated loan agreement. Undrawn senior secured term loan commitments generally have a shorter availability period than the term of the associated loan agreement. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had the following commitments to fund investments in current portfolio companies:\nTable 280: <table> <tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AppStar Financial, LLC - Revolver\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Clarabridge, Inc. - Revolver\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CrunchTime Information Systems, Inc. - Delayed Draw\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CrunchTime Information Systems, Inc. - Revolver\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ecommerce Industries, Inc. - Revolver\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Frontline Technologies Group LLC - Delayed Draw\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Heartland Automotive Holdings, LLC - Revolver\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Helix Health Ltd. - Revolver\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Illuminate Education, Inc. - Revolver\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Industrial Physics LLC - Revolver\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> IRGSE Holding Corp. - Revolver\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lithium Technologies LLC - Revolver\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Leaf US Holdings, Inc. - Revolver\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marketo, Inc. - Revolver\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Northern Oil & Gas - Delayed Draw\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> My Alarm Center, LLC - Delayed Draw\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Network Merchants, Inc. - Revolver\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> PayLease, LLC - Revolver\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> PaySimple - Revolver\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rex Energy Corporation - Delayed Draw\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Riskonnect, Inc. - Revolver\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sailpoint Technologies, Inc. - Revolver\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ScentAir Technologies, Inc. - Revolver\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sovos Compliance, LLC - Delayed Draw\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sovos Compliance, LLC - Revolver\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Portfolio Company Commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 79.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 43.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Commitments and Contingencies\nAs of December 31, 2017, we did not have any unfunded commitments to fund investments to new borrowers that were not current portfolio companies as of such date. As of December 31, 2016, we had additional unfunded commitments of $50.0 million to fund investments to new borrowers that were not current portfolio companies as of such date.\nWe have certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Adviser provides us with investment advisory and management services. For these services, we pay the Management Fee and the Incentive Fee.\nUnder the Administration Agreement, our Adviser furnishes us with office facilities and equipment, provides us clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities and provides us with other administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. We reimburse our Adviser for the allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of our Board) of expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions and our allocable portion of the compensation of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other professionals who spend time on those related activities (based on a percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs). Our Adviser also offers on our behalf significant managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to offer to provide such assistance.\nContractual Obligations\nA summary of our contractual payment obligations as of December 31, 2017 is as follows:\nTable 281: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> After 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 486.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 30.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 456.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2019 Convertible Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 115.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 115.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2022 Convertible Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 115.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 115.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 716.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 145.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 571.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to the contractual payment obligations in the tables above, we also have commitments to fund investments and to pledge assets as collateral under the terms of our derivatives agreements.\nDistributions\nWe have elected and qualified to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our RIC status, we must distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year dividends for tax purposes equal to at least 90 percent of the sum of our:\nTable 282: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> investment company taxable income (which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid, for such taxable year; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 283: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> net tax-exempt interest income (which is the excess of our gross tax exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions) for such taxable year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a RIC, we (but not our stockholders) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on investment company taxable income and net capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders.\nWe intend to distribute annually all or substantially all of such income. To the extent that we retain our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income, we generally will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. We may choose to retain our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income, and pay the U.S. federal excise tax described below.\nAmounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax payable by us. To avoid this tax, we must distribute (or be treated as distributing) during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of:\nTable 284: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 98% of our net ordinary income excluding certain ordinary gains or losses for that calendar year;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 285: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 98.2% of our capital gain net income, adjusted for certain ordinary gains and losses, recognized for the twelve-month period ending on October 31 of that calendar year; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 286: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 100% of any income or gains recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in the manner necessary to minimize imposition of the 4% U.S. federal excise tax, sufficient amounts of our taxable income and capital gains may not be distributed to avoid entirely the imposition of this tax. In that event, we will be liable for this tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement.\nWe intend to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution. All dividends will be paid at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of our RIC status, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as our Board may deem relevant from time to time.\nTo the extent our current taxable earnings for a year fall below the total amount of our distributions for that year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our stockholders may be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather than our income or gains. Stockholders should read any written disclosure carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains.\nWe have adopted an opt out\u201d dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a cash dividend or other distribution, each stockholder that has not opted out\u201d of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock rather than receiving cash dividends. Stockholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions.\nRelated-Party Transactions\nWe have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:\nTable 287: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the Investment Advisory Agreement;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 288: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the Administration Agreement; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 289: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a license agreement with an affiliate of TPG under which the affiliate granted us a non-exclusive license to use the TPG name and logo, for a nominal fee, for so long as the Adviser or one of its affiliates remains our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the TPG\u201d name or logo.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting policies, including those relating to the valuation of our investment portfolio, are described below. The critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our risk factors as disclosed in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\u201d\nInvestments at Fair Value\nInvestment transactions purchased on a secondary basis are recorded on the trade date. Loan originations are recorded on the date of the binding commitment, which is generally the funding date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds received (excluding prepayment fees, if any) and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. The net change in unrealized gains or losses primarily reflects the change in investment values and also includes the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses with respect to investments realized during the period.\nInvestments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at those market quotations. To validate market quotations, we utilize a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available, as is the case for substantially all of our investments, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board, based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, our Audit Committee and independent third-party valuation firms engaged at the direction of the Board.\nAs part of the valuation process, the Board takes into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of our investments, including:\nTable 290: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company (that is, the total fair value of the portfolio company's debt and equity);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 291: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the nature and realizable value of any collateral;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 292: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the portfolio company's ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 293: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the markets in which the portfolio company does business;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 294: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a comparison of the portfolio company's securities to any similar publicly traded securities; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 295: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhen an external event, such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Board considers whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates our valuation.\nThe Board undertakes a multi-step valuation process, which includes, among other procedures, the following:\nTable 296: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The valuation process begins with each investment being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment in conjunction with the portfolio management team.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 297: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The Adviser's management reviews the preliminary valuations with the investment professionals. Agreed-upon valuation recommendations are presented to the Audit Committee.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 298: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The Audit Committee reviews the valuations presented and recommends values for each investment to the Board.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 299: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The Board reviews the recommended valuations and determines the fair value of each investment; valuations that are not based on readily available market quotations are valued in good faith based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, Audit Committee and, where applicable, other third parties.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe conduct this valuation process on a quarterly basis.\nIn connection with debt and equity securities that are valued at fair value in good faith by the Board, the Board has engaged independent third-party valuation firms to perform certain limited procedures that the Board has identified and requested them to perform.\nWe apply Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurement ( ASC 820\u201d), as amended, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC 820 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820, we consider our principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820 specifies a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in determination of fair value. In accordance with ASC 820, these levels are summarized below:\nTable 300: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Level 1-Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 301: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Level 2-Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 302: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Level 3-Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTransfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the quarter in which the transfers occur. In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, we apply the valuation policy approved by our Board that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, we evaluate the source of inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. When a security is valued based on prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services (that is, broker quotes), we subject those prices to various criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular investment would qualify for treatment as a Level 2 or Level 3 investment. For example, we review pricing methodologies provided by dealers or pricing services in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs. Some additional factors considered include the number of prices obtained, as well as an assessment as to their quality.\nOur accounting policy on the fair value of our investments is critical because the determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of these valuations, and any change in these valuations, on the consolidated financial statements.\nSee Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information on the fair value of our investments.\nInterest and Dividend Income Recognition\nInterest income is recorded on an accrual basis and includes the amortization of discounts and premiums. Discounts and premiums to par value on securities purchased are amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the respective security using the effective yield method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the amortization of discounts and premiums, if any.\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nDividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies.\nOur accounting policy on interest and dividend income recognition is critical because it involves the primary source of our revenue and accordingly is significant to the financial results as disclosed in our consolidated financial statements.\nU.S. Federal Income Taxes\nWe have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We also have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code. So long as we maintain our status as a RIC, we will generally not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income or excise taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute at least annually to our stockholders as dividends. As a result, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by us represents obligations of our stockholders and will not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not\u201d threshold are reversed and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2017, the Company did not have any uncertain tax positions that met the recognition or measurement criteria, nor did the Company have any unrecognized tax benefits.

As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $488.2 million of availability on our Revolving Credit Facility, subject to asset coverage limitations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, no shares were repurchased under the Company 10b5-1 Plan. During the year ended December 31, 2016, 86,081 shares were repurchased under the Company 10b5-1 Plan at a weighted average price per share of $15.44, inclusive of commissions, for a total cost of $1.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, 2,000 shares were repurchased under the Company 10b5-1 Plan at a weighted average price per share of $14.44, inclusive of commissions, for a total cost of $28.9.\nOur portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of investments. We recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOn August 4, 2015, our Board authorized us to enter into a new stock repurchase plan, the Company 10b5-1 Plan, to acquire up to $50 million in the aggregate of our common stock at prices just below our net asset value over an initial six month period, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, and has continued to authorize extensions of the plan termination date prior to its expiration since that time. On February 21, 2018, the Board authorized the extension of the termination date of the Company 10b5-1 Plan to August 31, 2018. Unless extended or terminated by the Board, the Company 10b5-1 Plan will be in effect through the earlier of August 31, 2018 or such time as the current approved repurchase amount of up to $50 million has been fully utilized, subject to certain conditions.\n \u2022 source of income limitations; \nThe Convertible Senior Notes are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 470-20. Upon conversion of any of the Convertible Senior Notes, we intend to pay the outstanding principal amount in cash and, to the extent that the conversion value exceeds the principal amount, we have the option to pay in cash or shares of our common stock (or a combination of cash and shares) in respect of the excess amount, subject to the requirements of the indentures governing the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes. We have determined that the embedded conversion options in the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes are not required to be separately accounted for as a derivative under U.S. GAAP. In accounting for the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes, we estimated at the time of issuance separate debt and equity components of the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes. An original issue discount equal to the equity components of the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes was recorded in additional paid-in capital\u201d in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the issuance costs associated with the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes were allocated to the debt and equity components in proportion to the allocation of the proceeds and accounted for as deferred financing costs and equity issuance costs, respectively.\n \u2022 cash dividends to the holders of our shares. \n \u2022 An investment will be assigned a rating of 4 if a material covenant has been violated, but the company is making its scheduled payments. For these investments, the Adviser prepares a bi-monthly asset review email and generally has monthly meetings with senior management. For investments where there have been material defaults, including bankruptcy filings, failures to achieve financial performance requirements or failure to maintain liquidity or loan-to-value requirements, the Adviser often will take immediate action to protect its position. These remedies may include negotiating for additional collateral, modifying investment terms or structure, or payment of amendment and waiver fees. \nA summary of our contractual payment obligations as of December 31, 2017 is as follows:\nManagement Fees\nRelationship with our Adviser, TSSP and TPG\nAs of December 31, 2017, we did not have any unfunded commitments to fund investments to new borrowers that were not current portfolio companies as of such date. As of December 31, 2016, we had additional unfunded commitments of $50.0 million to fund investments to new borrowers that were not current portfolio companies as of such date.\n \u2022 A rating of 5 indicates an investment is in default on its interest or principal payments. For these investments, our Adviser reviews the investments on a bi-monthly basis and, where possible, pursues workouts that achieve an early resolution to avoid further deterioration. The Adviser retains legal counsel and takes actions to preserve our rights, which may include working with the portfolio company to have the default cured, to have the investment restructured or to have the investment repaid through a consensual workout. \nTransfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the quarter in which the transfers occur. In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, we apply the valuation policy approved by our Board that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, we evaluate the source of inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. When a security is valued based on prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services (that is, broker quotes), we subject those prices to various criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular investment would qualify for treatment as a Level 2 or Level 3 investment. For example, we review pricing methodologies provided by dealers or pricing services in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs. Some additional factors considered include the number of prices obtained, as well as an assessment as to their quality.\n \u2022 directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums; \nWe evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not\u201d threshold are reversed and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2017, the Company did not have any uncertain tax positions that met the recognition or measurement criteria, nor did the Company have any unrecognized tax benefits. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. The Company's 2016, 2015 and 2014 tax year returns remain subject to examination by the relevant federal, state, and local tax authorities.\nThe indentures governing the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes contain certain covenants, including covenants requiring us to comply with the requirement under the 1940 Act that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the 1940 Act, equal at least 200% and to provide financial information to the holders of the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes under certain circumstances. These covenants are subject to important limitations and exceptions that are described in the indentures governing the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with the terms of the indentures governing the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes.\n \u2022 Level 1-Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. \nThe Company 10b5-1 Plan expired in accordance with its terms on June 30, 2015. On August 4, 2015, the Board authorized us to enter into a new stock repurchase plan, on substantially the same terms as the prior stock repurchase plan, over an initial six month period, and has continued to authorize extensions of the plan termination date prior to its expiration since that time. On February 21, 2018, the Board authorized the extension of the termination date of the Company 10b5-1 Plan to August 31, 2018. Unless extended or terminated by the Board, the Company 10b5-1 Plan will be in effect through the earlier of August 31, 2018 or such time as the current approved repurchase amount of up to $50 million has been fully utilized, subject to certain conditions.\nTSSP, with approximately $20 billion of assets under management as of September 30, 2017, is TPG's special situations and credit platform and encompasses TPG Specialty Lending, TPG Opportunities Partners and TSSP Adjacent Opportunities Partners, which invest in special situations and distressed investments across the credit cycle, TSL Europe, which is aimed at European middle-market loan originations, and TPG Institutional Credit Partners, which is a public-side\u201d credit investment platform focused on investment opportunities in broadly syndicated leveraged loan markets. TSSP has extensive experience with highly complex, global public and private investments executed through primary originations, secondary market purchases and restructurings, and has a team of over 180 investment and operating professionals. As of December 31, 2017, thirty one (31) of these personnel are dedicated to our business, including twenty four (24) investment professionals.\nMarket Trends\nHolders may convert their 2019 Convertible Senior Notes at their option at any time prior to June 15, 2019 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2014 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period, or the measurement period, in which the trading price (as defined in the indenture governing the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes) per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.\nOur accounting policy on the fair value of our investments is critical because the determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of these valuations, and any change in these valuations, on the consolidated financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOperating results for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\n \u2022 net tax-exempt interest income (which is the excess of our gross tax exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions) for such taxable year. \n (1) The amount available reflects any limitations related to the respective debt facilities' borrowing bases. \n \u2022 Level 3-Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. \nOur shares are currently listed on the NYSE under the symbol TSLX.\u201d\nOn March 3, 2016, we issued 5,000,000 shares of common stock at $16.42 per share. Net of underwriting fees and offering costs, we received total cash proceeds of $78.3 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 we had $66.7 million in unrealized appreciation on 43 portfolio company investments, which was offset by $48.9 million in unrealized depreciation on 32 portfolio company investments. Unrealized appreciation for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from an increase in fair value, primarily due to reversal of prior period unrealized depreciation, positive valuation adjustments and tightening credit spreads. Unrealized depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from the reversal of prior period unrealized appreciation on realized investments and in some instances negative credit-related adjustments.\nFor the calendar years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 we recorded a net expense of $2.8 million, $2.2 million and $1.5 million, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax.\nThe following tables show the fair value and amortized cost of our performing and non-accrual investments as of December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n \u2022 The Adviser's management reviews the preliminary valuations with the investment professionals. Agreed-upon valuation recommendations are presented to the Audit Committee. \nOn February 20, 2018, we entered into an amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility. Under the terms of the amendment, aggregate commitments under the facility were increased to $990 million. In addition, with respect to $895 million in commitments, amounts drawn under the facility bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of either 1.75% or 1.875%, or the prime rate plus a margin of either 0.75% or 0.875%. With respect to $95 million in commitments, amounts drawn under the facility bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of either 1.75% or 2.00%, or the prime rate plus a margin of either 0.75% or 1.00%.\n\n \u2022 investments in portfolio companies and other investments and to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements; \n \u2022 the markets in which the portfolio company does business; \nOn or after June 15, 2019 until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any of the foregoing circumstances.\nOn December 16, 2014, we were granted an exemptive order from the SEC that allows us to co-invest, subject to certain conditions and to the extent the size of an investment opportunity exceeds the amount our Adviser has independently determined is appropriate to invest, with affiliates of TSSP and TPG in middle-market loan origination activities for companies domiciled in the United States and certain follow-on\u201d investments in companies in which we have already co-invested pursuant to the order and remain invested.\nHedging\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had net realized losses on investments of $14.3 million, $0.8 million and $5.0 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had net realized gains on interest rate swaps of $1.8 million. We did not have realized gains or losses on interest rate swaps for the years ended December 31, 2017 or 2016. For both the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2015, we had net realized gains on foreign currency transactions of less than $0.1 million, respectively, and net realized losses on foreign currency transactions of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of translating foreign currency related to our non-USD denominated investments. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had net realized losses on foreign currency investments of $4.9 million, $10.9 million, $0.4 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 we had net realized gains on foreign currency borrowings of $5.2 million, $11.8 million and $0.4 million, respectively.\nIntroduction\nThe Revolving Credit Facility includes customary events of default, as well as customary covenants, including restrictions on certain distributions and financial covenants requiring:\nThe weighted average yields and interest rates of our performing debt investments at fair value as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\n (1) Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more or when management has reasonable doubt that the borrower will pay principal or interest in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest has been paid and, in management's judgment, the borrower is likely to make principal and interest payments in the future. Management may determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if, notwithstanding any failure to pay, the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. See -Critical Accounting Policies - Interest and Dividend Recognition.\u201d \nU.S. Federal Income Taxes\nWe conduct this valuation process on a quarterly basis.\n \u2022 costs of preparing financial statements and maintaining books and records and filing reports or other documents with the SEC (or other regulatory bodies) and other reporting and compliance costs, and the compensation of professionals responsible for the preparation of the foregoing, including the allocable portion of the compensation of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other professionals who spend time on those related activities (based on the percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs); \nWe apply Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurement ( ASC 820\u201d), as amended, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC 820 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820, we consider our principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820 specifies a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in determination of fair value. In accordance with ASC 820, these levels are summarized below:\n \u2022 attendance at, and participation in, board meetings; and \nOther Commitments and Contingencies\nResults of Operations\nProfessional Fees and Other General and Administrative Expenses\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\n \u2022 a liquidity test under which we must not maintain cash and liquid investments of less than 10% of the covered debt amount for more than 30 consecutive business days under circumstances where our adjusted covered debt balance is greater than 90% of our adjusted borrowing base under the facility; and \nAverage gross IRR on our exited investments reflects only invested and realized cash amounts as described above, and does not reflect any unrealized gains or losses in our portfolio.\n \u2022 transfer agent and custodial fees; \nWe currently do not limit our focus to any specific industry and we may invest in larger or smaller companies on occasion. We classify the industries of our portfolio companies by end-market (such as healthcare, and business services) and not by the products or services (such as software) directed to those end-markets.\nThe limited number of providers is further exacerbated by the specialized due diligence and underwriting capabilities, as well as extensive ongoing monitoring, required for middle-market lending. We believe middle-market lending is generally more labor-intensive than lending to larger companies due to smaller investment sizes and the lack of publicly available information on these companies.\nWe focus primarily on the direct origination of loans to middle-market companies domiciled in the United States.\nThe Company 10b5-1 Plan is designed to allow us to repurchase our common stock at times when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws. The Company 10b5-1 Plan requires Goldman, Sachs & Co., as our agent, to repurchase shares of common stock on our behalf when the market price per share is below the most recently reported net asset value per share (including any updates, corrections or adjustments publicly announced by us to any previously announced net asset value per share). Under the Company 10b5-1 Plan, the agent will increase the volume of purchases made as the price of our common stock declines, subject to volume restrictions. The timing and amount of any stock repurchases will depend on the terms and conditions of the Company 10b5-1 Plan, the market price of our common stock and trading volumes, and no assurance can be given that any particular amount of common stock will be repurchased.\nChanges in our net investment income are primarily driven by the spread between the payments we receive from our investments in our portfolio companies against our cost of funding, rather than by changes in interest rates. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of floating rate loans, and our credit facilities and Convertible Senior Notes, after taking into account the effect of the interest rate swaps we have entered into in connection with the Convertible Senior Notes, all bear interest at floating rates. Macro trends in base interest rates like LIBOR may affect our net investment income over the long term. However, because we generally originate loans to a small number of portfolio companies each quarter, and those investments also vary in size, our results in any given period-including the interest rate on investments that were sold or repaid in a period compared to the interest rate of new investments made during that period-often are idiosyncratic, and reflect the characteristics of the particular portfolio companies that we invested in or exited during the period and not necessarily any trends in our business.\n \u2022 the requirement to distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year at least 90% of our investment company taxable income and tax-exempt interest for that taxable year. \n \u2022 Level 2-Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. \nAs of December 31, 2017, aggregate commitments under the facility were $975 million. The facility includes an uncommitted accordion feature that allows us, under certain circumstances, to increase the size of the facility to up to $1.25 billion.\nPortfolio Company Commitments\n \u2022 the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our stockholders (including printing and mailing costs), the costs of any stockholders' meetings and the compensation of investor relations personnel responsible for the preparation of the foregoing and related matters; \nUnder the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement, the Adviser's services are not exclusive, and the Adviser is free to furnish similar or other services to others, so long as its services to us are not impaired. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, we will pay the Adviser the base management fee, or the Management Fee, and may also pay certain incentive fees, or the Incentive Fees.\nThe Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Adviser monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. The Adviser has a number of methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we made new investment commitments of $718.7 million in 20 new portfolio companies and 14 existing portfolio companies. For this period, we had $385.2 million aggregate principal amount in exits and repayments.\n \u2022 a comparison of the portfolio company's securities to any similar publicly traded securities; and \nThe Board undertakes a multi-step valuation process, which includes, among other procedures, the following:\nSince we began investing in 2011 through December 31, 2017, weighted by capital invested, our exited investments have generated an average realized gross internal rate of return to us of 18.8% (based on total capital invested of $2.6 billion and total proceeds from these exited investments of $3.2 billion). Eighty eight percent of these exited investments resulted in a realized gross internal rate of return to us of 10% or greater.\n \u2022 commissions and other compensation payable to brokers or dealers; \nAs a RIC, we (but not our stockholders) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on investment company taxable income and net capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders.\n \u2022 100% of any income or gains recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years. \n (2) The carrying values of the Revolving Credit Facility and 2019 Convertible Senior Notes are presented net of deferred financing costs of $8.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively. \n\nOur accounting policy on interest and dividend income recognition is critical because it involves the primary source of our revenue and accordingly is significant to the financial results as disclosed in our consolidated financial statements.\nUnder the Administration Agreement, our Adviser furnishes us with office facilities and equipment, provides us clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities and provides us with other administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. We reimburse our Adviser for the allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of our Board) of expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions and our allocable portion of the compensation of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other professionals who spend time on those related activities (based on a percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs). Our Adviser also offers on our behalf significant managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to offer to provide such assistance.\nOur Investment Framework\n \u2022 amounts payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making or holding investments; \nInvestment transactions purchased on a secondary basis are recorded on the trade date. Loan originations are recorded on the date of the binding commitment, which is generally the funding date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds received (excluding prepayment fees, if any) and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. The net change in unrealized gains or losses primarily reflects the change in investment values and also includes the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses with respect to investments realized during the period.\nWe have in place a stock repurchase plan, the Company 10b5-1 Plan, to acquire up to $50 million in the aggregate of our common stock at prices below our net asset value per share over a specified period, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. We put the Company 10b5-1 Plan in place because we believe that if our common stock is trading below our then-current net asset value, it is in the best interest of our stockholders for us to reinvest in our portfolio and increase our leverage ratio through share repurchases.\nWhile we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in the manner necessary to minimize imposition of the 4% U.S. federal excise tax, sufficient amounts of our taxable income and capital gains may not be distributed to avoid entirely the imposition of this tax. In that event, we will be liable for this tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement.\n \u2022 indemnification payments; \nAmounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax payable by us. To avoid this tax, we must distribute (or be treated as distributing) during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of:\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWhen an external event, such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Board considers whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates our valuation.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our portfolio based on fair value consisted of 93.4% first-lien debt investments, 3.6% second-lien debt investments, and 3.0% equity and other investments. As of December 31, 2016, our portfolio based on fair value consisted of 96.5% first-lien debt investments, 1.2% second-lien debt investments, 0.6% mezzanine and unsecured debt investments, and 1.7% equity and other investments.\n2023 Notes\n \u2022 The Audit Committee reviews the valuations presented and recommends values for each investment to the Board. \n \u2022 debt service, repayment, and other financing costs; and \nInterest expense, including other debt financing expenses, increased from $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $27.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the average 1-month LIBOR rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 0.5% to 1.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and an increase in our average interest rate on debt outstanding due to a change in the mix of our debt financing sources. The average interest rate on our debt outstanding increased from 2.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 3.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the increase in LIBOR and a change in the mix of our debt financing sources.\nWe have certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Adviser provides us with investment advisory and management services. For these services, we pay the Management Fee and the Incentive Fee.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 we had $9.0 million in unrealized appreciation on 15 portfolio company investments, which was offset by $43.3 million in unrealized depreciation on 40 portfolio company investments. Unrealized appreciation for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted from an increase in fair value, primarily due to positive valuation adjustments. Unrealized depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted from widening in credit spreads, the reversal of prior period unrealized appreciation and in some instances negative credit-related adjustments.\n\nAn imbalance between the supply of, and demand for, middle-market debt capital creates attractive pricing dynamics for investors such as BDCs. The negotiated nature of middle-market financings also generally provides for more favorable terms to the lenders, including stronger covenant and reporting packages, better call protection and lender-protective change of control provisions. We believe that BDCs have flexibility to develop loans that reflect each borrower's distinct situation, provide long-term relationships and a potential source for future capital, which renders BDCs, including us, attractive lenders.\nWhile as a BDC the amount of leverage that we are permitted to use is limited in significant respects, we use leverage to increase our ability to make investments. The amount of leverage we use in any period depends on a variety of factors, including cash available for investing, the cost of financing and general economic and market conditions, however, our total borrowings are limited so that our asset coverage ratio cannot fall below 200% immediately after any borrowing, as defined in the 1940 Act. In any period, our interest expense will depend largely on the extent of our borrowing and we expect interest expense will increase as we increase leverage over time within the limits of the 1940 Act. In addition, we may dedicate assets as collateral to financing facilities from time to time.\nUnder the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Adviser also provides administrative services to us. These services include providing office space, equipment and office services, maintaining financial records, preparing reports to stockholders and reports filed with the SEC, and managing the payment of expenses and the oversight of the performance of administrative and professional services rendered by others. Certain of these services are reimbursable to the Adviser under the terms of the Administration Agreement.\nInterest from investments, which includes amortization of upfront fees and prepayment fees, increased from $177.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $200.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase in accelerated amortization of upfront fees and prepayment fees. Accelerated amortization of upfront fees, primarily from unscheduled paydowns, increased from $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and prepayment fees increased from $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The accelerated amortization and prepayment fees primarily resulted from full paydowns on seven portfolio investments, a partial paydown on one portfolio investment and prepayment fees on four portfolio investments during the year ended December 31, 2016, and full paydowns on 22 portfolio investments, partial paydowns on seven portfolio investments and prepayment fees on 12 portfolio investments during the year ended December 31, 2017. Dividend income decreased from $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to a partial realization of dividend yielding investments in 2017. Other income decreased from $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to lower syndication, amendment and agency fees earned during 2017.\nAny waived Incentive Fees are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $3.2 million of restricted cash pledged as collateral under our interest rate swap agreements, compared to $1.1 million as of December 31, 2016.\nExpenses\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our investments consisted of the following:\nWe have elected and qualified to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our RIC status, we must distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year dividends for tax purposes equal to at least 90 percent of the sum of our:\n \u2022 assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants; \nThe Convertible Senior Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to our future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Senior Notes; equal in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities.\n \u2022 The Board reviews the recommended valuations and determines the fair value of each investment; valuations that are not based on readily available market quotations are valued in good faith based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, Audit Committee and, where applicable, other third parties. \nIn connection with the offering, we entered into an interest rate swap to better align the interest rates of our liabilities with our investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans. As a result of the swap, our effective interest rate on the 2023 Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 199 basis points. The swap transaction matures on January 22, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $6.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we provided $82.4 million in cash for operating activities, primarily as a result of proceeds from investments of $103.6 million, repayments on investments of $922.5 million, and an increase in net assets resulting from operations of $111.6 million, which was partially offset by funding portfolio investments of $1,028.0 million and other operating activity of $27.3 million. Lastly, cash used in financing activities was $81.7 million during the period, primarily due to paydowns on our Revolving Credit Facility of $1,171.6 million, dividends paid of $94.7 million, and deferred financing costs of $3.9 million, which were partially offset by borrowings of $1,188.5 million (including the issuance of $115.0 million principal amount of our 2022 Convertible Senior Notes).\nFor the periods December 31, 2016 and prior, the Adviser voluntarily waived the Incentive Fees attributable to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income accrued by us as a result of our ownership of the TICC Shares. The Adviser has not waived any part of the Incentive Fee related to capital gains and losses attributable to our ownership of the TICC Shares and, accordingly, any realized capital gains or losses and unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation with respect to the TICC Shares applies towards our cumulative realized capital gains on which the Incentive Fee related to capital gains and losses is calculated.\n\n (1) Includes two fixed rate investments for the year ended December 31, 2017 and one fixed rate investment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 for which we entered into interest rate swap agreements to swap to floating rates. \nAs of December 31, 2017, the largest industry represented 14.0% of our total investment portfolio based on fair value.\nNet proceeds received from our common stock issuance in March 2016, and net proceeds received from the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes and the 2023 Notes were used to pay down borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility.\n2019 Convertible Senior Notes\nAs of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had investments in 45 and 52 portfolio companies, respectively, with an aggregate fair value of $1,693.7 million and $1,657.4 million, respectively.\nThe limited number of dedicated providers of capital to middle-market companies, combined with increases in required capital levels for regulated financial institutions, reduces the capacity of traditional lenders to serve middle-market companies. We believe that the limited availability of capital creates a significant opportunity for us to directly originate investments. We also believe that the large amount of uninvested capital held by private equity firms will continue to drive deal activity, which may in turn create additional demand for debt capital.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the principal amount of the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes exceeded the value of the underlying shares multiplied by the per share closing price of our common stock.\nExecutive Officer and our Adviser's Co-Chief Investment Officer Joshua Easterly and our Adviser's Co-Chief Investment Officer Alan Waxman, both of whom have substantial experience in credit origination, underwriting and asset management. Our investment decisions are made by our Investment Review Committee, which includes senior personnel of our Adviser and TPG Sixth Street Partners, or TSSP.\nIncentive Fees\n \u2022 The valuation process begins with each investment being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment in conjunction with the portfolio management team. \n \u2022 the cost of operations (including paying our Adviser); \n \u2022 calculating individual asset values and our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firms); \nOverview\n \u2022 the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company (that is, the total fair value of the portfolio company's debt and equity); \nThe Company 10b5-1 Plan is designed to allow us to repurchase our common stock at times when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws. The Company 10b5-1 Plan requires Goldman, Sachs & Co., as our agent, to repurchase shares of common stock on our behalf when the market price per share is below the most recently reported net asset value per share (including any updates, corrections or adjustments publicly announced by us to any previously announced net asset value per share). Under the Company 10b5-1 Plan, the agent will increase the volume of purchases made as the price of our common stock declines, subject to volume restrictions. The timing and amount of any stock repurchases will depend on the terms and conditions of the Company 10b5-1 Plan, the market price of our common stock and trading volumes, and no assurance can be given that any particular amount of common stock will be repurchased.\nOur Adviser consults with TSSP and TPG in connection with a substantial number of our investments. The TSSP and TPG platforms provide us with a breadth of large and scalable investment resources. We believe we benefit from their market expertise, insights into sector and macroeconomic trends and intensive due diligence capabilities, which help us discern market conditions that vary across industries and credit cycles, identify favorable investment opportunities and manage our portfolio of investments. TSSP and TPG will refer all middle-market loan origination activities for companies domiciled in the United States to us and conduct those activities through us. The Adviser will determine whether it would be permissible, advisable or otherwise appropriate for us to pursue a particular investment opportunity allocated to us by TSSP and TPG.\nIn June 2014, we issued in a private offering $115 million aggregate principal amount convertible senior notes due December 2019, or the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes. The 2019 Convertible Senior Notes were issued in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The 2019 Convertible Senior Notes are unsecured and bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year, payable semiannually. The 2019 Convertible Senior Notes will mature on December 15, 2019. In certain circumstances, the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election, at an initial conversion rate of 38.7162 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2019 Convertible Senior Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $25.83 per share of our common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. As of December 31, 2017, the estimated adjusted conversion price was approximately $25.41. The sale of the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes generated net proceeds of approximately $110.8 million. We used the net proceeds of the offering to pay down debt under the Revolving Credit Facility. In connection with the offering of 2019 Convertible Senior Notes, we have entered into interest rate swaps to continue to align the interest rates of our liabilities with our investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans. As a result of the swaps, our effective interest rate on the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 286 basis points.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\n \u2022 98% of our net ordinary income excluding certain ordinary gains or losses for that calendar year; \n \u2022 An investment is rated 2 if it is performing as agreed, but, in the opinion of the Adviser, there may be concerns about the company's operating performance or trends in the industry. For these investments, in addition to monthly reports and quarterly asset reviews, the Adviser also researches any areas of concern with the objective of early intervention with the portfolio company. \nThe purchase of shares pursuant to the Company 10b5-1 Plan is intended to satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, and will otherwise be subject to applicable law, including Regulation M, which may prohibit purchases under certain circumstances.\nInterest expense, including other debt financing expenses, increased from $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average debt outstanding from $540.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $725.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as well an increase in the average 1-month LIBOR rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 0.20% to 0.50% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The average interest rate on our debt outstanding increased from 2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 2.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the increase in LIBOR.\nAs part of the monitoring process, the Adviser regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and, on a quarterly basis, grades each investment on a risk scale of 1 to 5. Risk assessment is not standardized in our industry and our risk assessment may not be comparable to ones used by our competitors. Our assessment is based on the following categories:\n \u2022 overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future. \nInvestments\n \u2022 the Investment Advisory Agreement; \nInvestment Structuring. We focus on investing at the top of the capital structure and protecting that position. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 97.0% of our portfolio was invested in secured debt, including 93.4% in first-lien debt investments. We carefully perform diligence and structure investments to include strong investor covenants. As a result, we structure investments with a view to creating opportunities for early intervention in the event of non-performance or stress. In addition, we seek to retain effective voting control in investments over the loans or particular class of securities in which we invest through maintaining affirmative voting positions or negotiating consent rights that allow us to retain a blocking position. We also aim for our loans to mature on a medium term, between two to six years after origination. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the weighted average term on new investment commitments in new portfolio companies was 4.2 years.\n\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to our Adviser under the Investment Advisory Agreement, expenses reimbursable under the Administration Agreement and other operating costs described below. Additionally, we pay interest expense on our outstanding debt. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including those relating to:\nLoan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income using the effective interest method for term instruments and the straight-line method for revolving or delayed draw instruments. Repayments of our debt investments can reduce interest income from period to period. We record prepayment premiums on loans as interest income when earned. We also may generate revenue in the form of commitment, amendment, structuring, syndication or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. The frequency or volume of these repayments may fluctuate significantly.\nOperating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nRevolving Credit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, our weighted average total yield of debt and income producing securities at fair value (which includes interest income and amortization of fees and discounts) was 10.7% and 10.4%, respectively, and our weighted average total yield of debt and income-producing securities at amortized cost (which includes interest income and amortization of fees and discounts) was 10.8% and 10.4%, respectively.\nOur liquidity and capital resources are derived primarily from proceeds from equity issuances, advances from our credit facilities, and cash flows from operations. The primary uses of our cash and cash equivalents are:\nTPG Specialty Lending, Inc. is a Delaware corporation formed on July 21, 2010. The Adviser is our external manager. We have three wholly owned subsidiaries, TC Lending, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which holds a California finance lender and broker license, TPG SL SPV, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, in which we hold assets that were previously used to support our asset-backed credit facility, and TSL MR, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, in which we hold certain investments.\n \u2022 expenses, including travel expenses, incurred by the Adviser, or members of our Investment Team, or payable to third parties, in respect of due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and, if necessary, in respect of enforcing our rights with respect to investments in existing portfolio companies; \nWe have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We also have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code. So long as we maintain our status as a RIC, we will generally not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income or excise taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute at least annually to our stockholders as dividends. As a result, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by us represents obligations of our stockholders and will not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and as a RIC under the Code. We made our BDC election on April 15, 2011. As a result, we are required to comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements, such as:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we made new investment commitments of $562.7 million in 14 new portfolio companies and 9 existing portfolio companies. For this period, we had $416.5 million aggregate principal amount in exits and repayments.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit up to an aggregate amount of $75 million. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had no outstanding letters of credit issued through the Revolving Credit Facility. The amount available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility is reduced by any letters of credit issued through the Revolving Credit Facility.\n2022 Convertible Senior Notes\nIn addition, as part of our risk strategy on investments, we may reduce certain levels of investments through partial sales or syndication to additional investors.\nDividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies.\nOn November 3, 2014, the Board approved the Company 10b5-1 Plan to acquire up to $50 million in the aggregate of our common stock at prices just below our net asset value over a specified period, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. We put the Company 10b5-1 Plan in place because we believe that, in current market conditions, if our common stock is trading below our then-current net asset value, it is in the best interest of our stockholders for us to reinvest in our portfolio and increase our leverage ratio through share repurchases.\nWe believe our ability to co-invest with TSSP and TPG affiliates is particularly useful where we identify larger capital commitments than otherwise would be appropriate for us. We expect that with the ability to co-invest with TSSP and TPG affiliates we will continue to be able to provide one-stop\u201d financing to a potential portfolio company in these circumstances, which may allow us to capture opportunities where we alone could not commit the full amount of required capital or would have to spend additional time to locate unaffiliated co-investors.\nThrough our Adviser, we consider potential investments utilizing a four-tiered investment framework and against our existing portfolio as a whole:\n \u2022 investment company taxable income (which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid, for such taxable year; and \n \u2022 Independent Director fees and expenses; \n \u2022 a license agreement with an affiliate of TPG under which the affiliate granted us a non-exclusive license to use the TPG name and logo, for a nominal fee, for so long as the Adviser or one of its affiliates remains our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the TPG\u201d name or logo. \nIncome Taxes, Including Excise Taxes\nDebt obligations consisted of the following as of December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nBusiness and sector selection. We focus on companies with enterprise value between $50 million and $1 billion. When reviewing potential investments, we seek to invest in businesses with high marginal cash flow, recurring revenue streams and where we believe credit quality will improve over time. We look for portfolio companies that we think have a sustainable competitive advantage in growing industries or distressed situations. We also seek companies where our investment will have a low loan-to-value ratio.\nSee Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information on the fair value of our investments.\n \u2022 stockholders' equity of at least $500 million plus 25% of the net proceeds of the sale of equity interests after December 22, 2016. \n \u2022 review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies. \nThe following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 investment performance rating scale at fair value as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. Investment performance ratings are accurate only as of those dates and may change due to subsequent developments relating to a portfolio company's business or financial condition, market conditions or developments, and other factors.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had unrealized depreciation on foreign currency borrowings of $11.5 million and $3.6 million, respectively, primarily as a result of fluctuations in the GBP and EUR exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2017 and GBP, SEK and EUR exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we\n (2) The carrying values of the Revolving Credit Facility and 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes are presented net of deferred financing costs of $7.1 million, $1.5 million and $3.2 million, respectively. \nRelated-Party Transactions\nExpenses\nInvestment Income\n (1) Includes fixed rate investments for which we entered into interest rate swap agreements to swap to floating rates. \n \u2022 all other expenses reasonably incurred by us in connection with making investments and administering our business. \nOur Adviser is a Delaware limited liability company. Our Adviser acts as our investment adviser and administrator and is a registered investment adviser with the SEC under the Advisers Act. Our Adviser sources and manages our portfolio through a dedicated team of investment professionals predominately focused on us. Our Investment Team is led by our Chairman and Chief\nAs part of the valuation process, the Board takes into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of our investments, including:\n (1) Includes foreign exchange hedging activity. \n \u2022 an asset coverage ratio of no less than 2 to 1 on the last day of any fiscal quarter; \nWe have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:\nWe are a specialty finance company focused on lending to middle-market companies. Since we began our investment activities in July 2011, through December 31, 2017, we have originated more than $7.3 billion aggregate principal amount of investments and retained approximately $4.4 billion aggregate principal amount of these investments on our balance sheet prior to any subsequent exits and repayments. We seek to generate current income primarily in U.S.-domiciled middle-market companies through direct originations of senior secured loans and, to a lesser extent, originations of mezzanine and unsecured loans and investments in corporate bonds and equity securities.\nCapital invested, with respect to an investment, represents the aggregate cost basis allocable to the realized or unrealized portion of the investment, net of any upfront fees paid at closing for the term loan portion of the investment. Capital invested also includes realized losses on hedging activity, with respect to an investment, which represents any inception-to-date realized losses on foreign currency forward contracts allocable to the investment, if any.\nIncentive Fees (net of waivers) related to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income increased from $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $22.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase resulted from the increase in the size of the portfolio and related increase in net investment income. Incentive Fees waived related to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income increased from $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, consisting solely of Incentive Fees attributable to our ownership of the TICC Shares. There were no Incentive Fees related to capital gains and losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2016 due to realized and unrealized losses on our investments.\nInterest\nWe invest in first-lien debt, second-lien debt, mezzanine and unsecured debt and equity and other investments. Our first-lien debt may include stand-alone first-lien loans; last out\u201d first-lien loans, which are loans that have a secondary priority behind super-senior first out\u201d first-lien loans; unitranche\u201d loans, which are loans that combine features of first-lien, second-lien and mezzanine debt, generally in a first-lien position; and secured corporate bonds with similar features to these categories of first-lien loans. Our second-lien debt may include secured loans, and, to a lesser extent, secured corporate bonds, with a secondary priority behind first-lien debt.\n\n \u2022 the costs of any public offerings of our common stock and other securities, including registration and listing fees; \nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we made new investment commitments of $1,072.6 million in 22 new portfolio companies and 12 existing portfolio companies. For this period, we had $951.5 million aggregate principal amount in exits and repayments.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we also issued 530,996 and 638,326 shares of our common stock, respectively, to investors who have not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan for proceeds of $10.2 million and $10.3 million, respectively. On January 12, 2018, we issued 153,295 shares of our common stock through our dividend reinvestment plan for proceeds of $2.9 million, which is not reflected in the number of shares issued for the year ended December 31, 2017 in this section or the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe maturity of the facility was also extended. With respect to $895 million in commitments, the revolving period ends in February 2022 and the stated maturity date is February 2023. For the remaining $95 million of commitments, the revolving period ends in either October 2019 or December 2020, and the stated maturity date is either October 2020 or December 2021. Under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, we may at any time determine to cancel the commitments that were not extended.\nRisk Mitigation. We seek to mitigate non-credit-related risk on our returns in several ways, including call protection provisions to protect future interest income. As of December 31, 2017, we had call protection on 91.2% of our debt investments based on fair value, with weighted average call prices of 106.2% for the first year, 103.2% for the second year and 101.4% for the third year, in each case from the date of the initial investment. As of December 31, 2017, 100.0% of our debt investments based on fair value bore interest at floating rates (when including investment specific hedges), with 93.3% of these subject to interest rate floors, which we believe helps act as a portfolio-wide hedge against inflation.\nWe intend to distribute annually all or substantially all of such income. To the extent that we retain our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income, we generally will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. We may choose to retain our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income, and pay the U.S. federal excise tax described below.\n \u2022 An investment is rated 1 if, in the opinion of the Adviser, it is performing as agreed and there are no concerns about the portfolio company's performance or ability to meet covenant requirements. For these investments, the Adviser generally prepares monthly reports on investment performance and intensive quarterly asset reviews. \nInterest and Dividend Income Recognition\nInvestments at Fair Value\nAverage gross IRR is the average of the gross IRR for each of our exited investments (each calculated as described above), weighted by the total capital invested for each of those investments.\nRealized Gross Internal Rate of Return\nWe generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate income from dividends on direct equity investments, capital gains on the sale of investments and various loan origination and other fees. Our debt investments typically have a term of two to six years, and, as of December 31, 2017, 100.0% of these investments based on fair value bore interest at a floating rate (when including investment specific hedges), with 93.3% of these subject to interest rate floors. Interest on debt investments is generally payable quarterly or semiannually. Some of our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. For the year ended December 31, 2017, 2.8% of our total investment income was comprised of PIK interest.\nOn August 23, 2012, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement with SunTrust Bank, as administrative agent, and J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, and certain other lenders (as amended, the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d).\nOur accounting policy on income taxes is critical because if we are unable to maintain our status as a RIC, we would be required to record a provision for corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes which may be significant to our financial results.\nAs of December 31, 2017, amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility, including amounts drawn in respect of letters of credit, bore interest at either LIBOR plus a margin of either 1.75% or 2.00%, or the prime rate plus a margin of either 0.75% or 1.00%, in each case, based on the total amount of the borrowing base relative to the sum of the total commitments (or, if greater, the total exposure) under the Revolving Credit Facility plus certain other designated secured debt. We may elect either the LIBOR or prime rate at the time of drawdown, and loans may be converted from one rate to another at any time, subject to certain conditions. We also pay a fee of 0.375% on undrawn amounts and, in respect of each undrawn letter of credit, a fee and interest rate equal to the then-applicable margin while the letter of credit is outstanding.\nGross IRR reflects historical results relating to our past performance and is not necessarily indicative of our future results. In addition, gross IRR does not reflect the effect of Management Fees, expenses, Incentive Fees or taxes borne, or to be borne, by us or our stockholders, and would be lower if it did.\n \u2022 the Management Fee and any Incentive Fee; \nAs of December 31, 2017, with respect to $915 million in commitments, the revolving period, during which period we, subject to certain conditions, may make borrowings under the facility, ended December 22, 2020 and the stated maturity date was December 22, 2021. For the remaining $60 million of commitments, the revolving period ended October 2, 2019 and the stated maturity date was October 2, 2020.\nInvestments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at those market quotations. To validate market quotations, we utilize a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available, as is the case for substantially all of our investments, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board, based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, our Audit Committee and independent third-party valuation firms engaged at the direction of the Board.\nIn addition, the Adviser voluntarily waived the Incentive Fees attributable to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income accrued by us as a result of our ownership of the TCAP Shares. The Adviser has not waived any part of the Incentive Fee related to capital gains and losses attributable to our ownership of the TCAP Shares and, accordingly, any realized capital gains or losses and unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation with respect to the TCAP Shares applies towards our cumulative realized capital gains on which the Incentive Fee related to capital gains and losses is calculated.\nIn connection with debt and equity securities that are valued at fair value in good faith by the Board, the Board has engaged independent third-party valuation firms to perform certain limited procedures that the Board has identified and requested them to perform.\n \u2022 the Administration Agreement; and \nContractual Obligations\nWe may borrow amounts in U.S. dollars or certain other permitted currencies. As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding debt denominated in Euro (EUR) of 59.4 million on our Revolving Credit Facility, included in the Outstanding Principal amount in the table above.\n \u2022 the Adviser's allocable share of costs incurred in providing significant managerial assistance to those portfolio companies that request it; \nIn January 2018, we issued $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on January 22, 2023 (the 2023 Notes\u201d). The principal amount of the 2023 Notes is payable at maturity. The 2023 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year, payable semi-annually commencing on July 22, 2018, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option at any time at par plus a make whole\u201d premium. Total proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Notes, net of underwriting discounts and estimated offering costs, were approximately $147.1 million. We used the net proceeds of the 2023 Notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we can be expected to carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year dividend distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such income, we accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income.\n \u2022 An investment will be assigned a rating of 3 if it is paying as agreed but a material covenant violation is expected. For these investments, in addition to monthly reports and quarterly asset reviews, the Adviser also adds the investment to its watch list\u201d and researches any areas of concern with the objective of early intervention with the portfolio company. \nOur current approach to hedging the foreign currency exposure in our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments is primarily to borrow the par amount in local currency under our Revolving Credit Facility to fund these investments. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had $11.5 million and $3.6 million of realized losses and $6.3 million of unrealized gains, respectively, on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated debt into U.S. dollars; such amounts approximate the corresponding unrealized gains and losses on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments into U.S. dollars for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. See Note 2 for additional disclosure regarding our accounting for foreign currency. See Note 7 for additional disclosure regarding the amounts of outstanding debt denominated in each foreign currency at December 31, 2017. See our consolidated schedule of investments for additional disclosure regarding the foreign currency amounts (in both par and fair value) of our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with ITEM 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\u201d Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\n \u2022 debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; \nManagement Fees (net of waivers) increased from $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Management Fees remained flat at $24.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017 due to total assets remaining $1.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017. Management Fees waived decreased from $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to owning investments subject to fee waivers for a shorter period in 2017 than 2016. Management Fees waived during the year ended December 31, 2016 were solely attributable to our ownership of TICC Shares. Management Fees waived during the year ended December 31, 2017 were solely attributable to our ownership of TCAP Shares.\nBy middle-market companies,\u201d we mean companies that have annual EBITDA, which we believe is a useful proxy for cash flow, of $10 million to $250 million, although we may invest in larger or smaller companies on occasion. As of December 31, 2017, our core portfolio companies, which excludes certain investments that fall outside of our typical borrower profile and represent 83.2% of our total investments based on fair value, had weighted average annual revenue of $130.3 million and weighted average annual EBITDA of $25.1 million.\nNet Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses\nThe Adviser has voluntarily waived the Management Fee on our ownership of the TCAP Shares for any period in which Triangle Capital Corp. remains our portfolio company. Any waived Management Fees are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser. For the period ended December 31, 2016 and prior, the Adviser voluntarily waived the Management Fee on our ownership of the TICC Shares. Any waived Management Fees are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser. Following our IPO, with the exception of its waiver of Management Fees attributable to our ownership of the TCAP Shares and TICC Shares, the Adviser has not waived its right to receive the full Management Fee payable pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement.\nLeverage\nWe have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our stockholders in each taxable year generally at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. To maintain our RIC status, we, among other things, have made and intend to continue to make the requisite distributions to our stockholders, which generally relieve us from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes.\n \u2022 direct costs and expenses of administration, including audit, accounting, consulting and legal costs; and \nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 we had $56.7 million in unrealized appreciation on 48 portfolio company investments, which was offset by $23.0 million in unrealized depreciation on 10 portfolio company investments. Unrealized appreciation for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted from an increase in fair value, primarily due to positive valuation adjustments and tightening credit spreads. Unrealized depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted from the reversal of prior period unrealized appreciation on realized investments and in some instances negative credit-related adjustments.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the terms of our debt arrangements. We intend to continue to utilize our credit facilities to fund investments and for other general corporate purposes.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn addition to interest income, our net investment income is also driven by prepayment and other fees, which also can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. The level of prepayment fees is generally correlated to the movement in credit spreads and risk premiums, but also will vary based on corporate events that may take place at an individual portfolio company in a given period-e.g., merger and acquisition activity, initial public offerings and restructurings. As noted above, generally a small but varied number of portfolio companies may make prepayments in any quarter, meaning that changes in the amount of prepayment fees received can vary significantly between periods and can vary without regard to underlying credit trends.\nGross IRR, with respect to an investment, is calculated based on the dates that we invested capital and dates we received distributions, regardless of when we made distributions to our stockholders. Initial investments are assumed to occur at time zero, and all cash flows are deemed to occur on the fifteenth of each month in which they occur.\n\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nThe following table summarizes our net realized and unrealized gains (losses) for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nInterest income is recorded on an accrual basis and includes the amortization of discounts and premiums. Discounts and premiums to par value on securities purchased are amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the respective security using the effective yield method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the amortization of discounts and premiums, if any.\nManagement Fees (net of waivers) increased from $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Management Fees increased from $21.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the increase in total assets, which increased from an average of $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 to an average of $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. Management Fees waived for both the year ended December 31, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2016 were $0.1 million. Management Fees waived during the year ended December 31, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2016 were solely attributable to our ownership of shares of common stock in the TICC Shares.\nWe intend to continue to generate cash primarily from cash flows from operations, future borrowings and future offerings of securities. We may from time to time enter into additional debt facilities, increase the size of existing facilities or issue debt securities. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock if immediately after the borrowing or issuance the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock, is at least 200%. As of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our asset coverage ratio was 235.5%, 237.7%, and 225.7%, respectively. We carefully consider our unfunded commitments for the purpose of planning our capital resources and ongoing liquidity including our financial leverage. Further, we maintain sufficient borrowing capacity within the 200% asset coverage limitation to cover any outstanding unfunded commitments we are required to fund.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into commitments to fund investments. We incorporate these commitments into our assessment of our liquidity position. Our senior secured revolving loan commitments are generally available on a borrower's demand and may remain outstanding until the maturity date of the applicable loan. Our senior secured term loan commitments are generally available on a borrower's demand and, once drawn, generally have the same remaining term as the associated loan agreement. Undrawn senior secured term loan commitments generally have a shorter availability period than the term of the associated loan agreement. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had the following commitments to fund investments in current portfolio companies:\nInternal rate of return, or IRR, is a measure of our discounted cash flows (inflows and outflows). Specifically, IRR is the discount rate at which the net present value of all cash flows is equal to zero. That is, IRR is the discount rate at which the present value of total capital invested in each of our investments is equal to the present value of all realized returns from that investment. Our IRR calculations are unaudited.\n\nThe debt in which we invest typically is not rated by any rating agency, but if these instruments were rated, they would likely receive a rating of below investment grade (that is, below BBB- or Baa3), which is often referred to as junk.\u201d\nWe have adopted an opt out\u201d dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a cash dividend or other distribution, each stockholder that has not opted out\u201d of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock rather than receiving cash dividends. Stockholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions.\n \u2022 administration fees payable under our Administration Agreement; \nTo the extent our current taxable earnings for a year fall below the total amount of our distributions for that year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our stockholders may be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather than our income or gains. Stockholders should read any written disclosure carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains.\nIn February 2017, we issued in a private offering $115 million aggregate principal amount convertible senior notes due August 2022, or the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes. We refer to the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes and the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes collectively as the Convertible Senior Notes. The 2022 Convertible Senior Notes were issued in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The 2022 Convertible Senior Notes are unsecured, and bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year, payable semiannually. The 2022 Convertible Senior Notes will mature on August 1, 2022. In certain circumstances, the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election, at an initial conversion rate of 46.8516 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2022 Convertible Senior Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $21.34 per share of our common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. As of December 31, 2017, the estimated adjusted conversion price was approximately $21.15. The sale of the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes generated net proceeds of approximately $111.2 million. We used the net proceeds of the offering to pay down debt under the Revolving Credit Facility. In connection with the offering of 2022 Convertible Senior Notes, we have entered into an interest rate swap to continue to align the interest rates of our liabilities with our investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans. As a result of the swaps, our effective interest rate on the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 237.2 basis points.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting policies, including those relating to the valuation of our investment portfolio, are described below. The critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our risk factors as disclosed in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\u201d\n (1) The amount available reflects any limitations related to the respective debt facilities' borrowing bases. \n \u2022 comparisons to other companies in the industry; \nIn addition to the contractual payment obligations in the tables above, we also have commitments to fund investments and to pledge assets as collateral under the terms of our derivatives agreements.\nProfessional fees increased from $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to an increase in costs associated with servicing our investment portfolio, as well as additional professional fees incurred relating to our investment in the TICC Shares and related activity. Other general and administrative fees decreased from $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n \u2022 the nature and realizable value of any collateral; \nDividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by TPG SL SPV, LLC, TC Lending, LLC and TSL MR, LLC and may be guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries in the future. The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a perfected first-priority security interest in substantially all the portfolio investments held by us and each guarantor. Proceeds from borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of portfolio investments.\nhad unrealized appreciation on foreign currency borrowings of $6.3 million, primarily as a result of fluctuations in the GBP, SEK and EUR exchange rates. For both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had unrealized appreciation on foreign currency cash and forward contracts of less than $0.1 million, primarily as a result of settling our foreign currency forward contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had unrealized depreciation on foreign currency cash and forward contracts of less than $0.1 million, primarily as a result of settling our foreign currency forward contracts. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had unrealized depreciation on interest rate swaps of $1.0 million, $0.3 million, and $0.5 million, respectively, due to fluctuations in interest rates.\n \u2022 98.2% of our capital gain net income, adjusted for certain ordinary gains and losses, recognized for the twelve-month period ending on October 31 of that calendar year; and \nWe expect that during periods of asset growth, our general and administrative expenses will be relatively stable or will decline as a percentage of total assets, and will increase as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset declines.\n \u2022 certain costs and expenses relating to distributions paid on our shares; \nDistributions", "item_7_text": "We believe trends in the middle-market lending environment, including the limited availability of capital, strong demand for debt capital and specialized lending requirements, are likely to continue to create favorable opportunities for us to invest at attractive risk-adjusted rates.\nProfessional fees decreased from $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to additional professional fees incurred relating to our investment in the TICC Shares and related activity for the year ended December 31, 2016. Other general and administrative fees increased from $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\n \u2022 periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; \nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $4.9 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we used $37.9 million in cash for operating activities, primarily as a result of funding portfolio investments of $720.7 million and other operating activity of $49.8 million, which was partially offset by proceeds from investments of $71.4 million, repayments on investments of $524.2 million, and an increase in net assets resulting from operations of $137.0 million. Lastly, cash provided by financing activities was $40.3 million during the period, primarily due to borrowings of $580.4 million and proceeds from issuance of common stock (net of purchases of treasury stock and offering and underwriting costs) of $76.9 million, partially offset by repayments on debt of $533.8 million, debt issuance costs of $2.9 million and dividends paid of $80.3 million.\n \u2022 taxes; \n\nRevenues\n \u2022 the portfolio company's ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow; \nHolders may convert their 2022 Convertible Senior Notes at their option at any time prior to February 1, 2022 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2017 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period, or the measurement period, in which the trading price (as defined in the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes) per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after February 1, 2022 until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any of the foregoing circumstances.\n \u2022 asset diversification requirements; and \n\nRealized returns, with respect to an investment, represents the total cash received with respect to each investment, including all amortization payments, interest, dividends, prepayment fees, upfront fees (except upfront fees paid at closing for the term loan portion of an investment), administrative fees, agent fees, amendment fees, accrued interest, and other fees and proceeds. Realized returns also include realized gains on hedging activity, with respect to an investment, which represents any inception-to-date realized gains on foreign currency forward contracts allocable to the investment, if any.\n \u2022 our fidelity bond; \nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nThe companies in which we invest use our capital to support organic growth, acquisitions, market or product expansion and recapitalizations (including restructurings). As of December 31, 2017, the largest single investment based on fair value represented 6.7% of our total investment portfolio.\n\nAs of December 31, 2017, the average investment size in each of our portfolio companies was approximately $37.6 million based on fair value.\nDeal Dynamics. We focus on, among other deal dynamics, direct origination of investments, where we identify and lead the investment transaction. A substantial majority of our portfolio investments are sourced through our direct or proprietary relationships.\n \u2022 costs of hedging; \nEquity\nInterest from investments, which includes amortization of upfront fees and prepayment fees, increased from $164.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $177.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the increase in the size of our investment portfolio. The average size of our investment portfolio increased from $1.4 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015 to $1.6 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016. Accelerated amortization of upfront fees, primarily from unscheduled paydowns, decreased from $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and prepayment fees decreased from $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The accelerated amortization and prepayment fees primarily resulted from full paydowns on 11 portfolio investments, a partial paydown on one portfolio investment and prepayment fees on 13 portfolio investments during the year ended December 31, 2015, and full paydowns on seven portfolio investments, a partial paydown on one portfolio investment and prepayment fees on four portfolio investments during the year ended December 31, 2016. Dividend income increased from $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to owning our dividend yielding investments for a full calendar year. Other income increased from $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to higher syndication, amendment and agency fees earned during 2016.\nOur level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital generally available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make.\nWe intend to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution. All dividends will be paid at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of our RIC status, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as our Board may deem relevant from time to time.\n\n \u2022 the requirement to invest at least 70% of our assets in qualifying assets\u201d; \nDebt\n\nOur investment activity for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 is presented below (information presented herein is at par value unless otherwise indicated).\nIncentive Fees (net of waivers) related to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income increased from $22.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase resulted from an increase in interest from investments received during the year ended December 31, 2017 and the related increase in net investment income. Incentive Fees waived related to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income decreased from $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, consisting solely of Incentive Fees attributable to our ownership of the TICC Shares for the year ended December 31, 2016 and to our ownership of the TCAP Shares for the year ended December 31, 2017. There were no Incentive Fees related to capital gains and losses for the year ended December 31, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2017 due to realized and unrealized losses on our investments.\nCash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017, taken together with cash available under our credit facilities, is expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations in the near term. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $488.2 million of availability on our Revolving Credit Facility, subject to asset coverage limitations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, no shares were repurchased under the Company 10b5-1 Plan. During the year ended December 31, 2016, 86,081 shares were repurchased under the Company 10b5-1 Plan at a weighted average price per share of $15.44, inclusive of commissions, for a total cost of $1.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, 2,000 shares were repurchased under the Company 10b5-1 Plan at a weighted average price per share of $14.44, inclusive of commissions, for a total cost of $28.9.\nOur portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of investments. We recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOn August 4, 2015, our Board authorized us to enter into a new stock repurchase plan, the Company 10b5-1 Plan, to acquire up to $50 million in the aggregate of our common stock at prices just below our net asset value over an initial six month period, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, and has continued to authorize extensions of the plan termination date prior to its expiration since that time. On February 21, 2018, the Board authorized the extension of the termination date of the Company 10b5-1 Plan to August 31, 2018. Unless extended or terminated by the Board, the Company 10b5-1 Plan will be in effect through the earlier of August 31, 2018 or such time as the current approved repurchase amount of up to $50 million has been fully utilized, subject to certain conditions.\n \u2022 source of income limitations; \nThe Convertible Senior Notes are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 470-20. Upon conversion of any of the Convertible Senior Notes, we intend to pay the outstanding principal amount in cash and, to the extent that the conversion value exceeds the principal amount, we have the option to pay in cash or shares of our common stock (or a combination of cash and shares) in respect of the excess amount, subject to the requirements of the indentures governing the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes. We have determined that the embedded conversion options in the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes are not required to be separately accounted for as a derivative under U.S. GAAP. In accounting for the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes, we estimated at the time of issuance separate debt and equity components of the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes. An original issue discount equal to the equity components of the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes was recorded in additional paid-in capital\u201d in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the issuance costs associated with the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes were allocated to the debt and equity components in proportion to the allocation of the proceeds and accounted for as deferred financing costs and equity issuance costs, respectively.\n \u2022 cash dividends to the holders of our shares. \n \u2022 An investment will be assigned a rating of 4 if a material covenant has been violated, but the company is making its scheduled payments. For these investments, the Adviser prepares a bi-monthly asset review email and generally has monthly meetings with senior management. For investments where there have been material defaults, including bankruptcy filings, failures to achieve financial performance requirements or failure to maintain liquidity or loan-to-value requirements, the Adviser often will take immediate action to protect its position. These remedies may include negotiating for additional collateral, modifying investment terms or structure, or payment of amendment and waiver fees. \nA summary of our contractual payment obligations as of December 31, 2017 is as follows:\nManagement Fees\nRelationship with our Adviser, TSSP and TPG\nAs of December 31, 2017, we did not have any unfunded commitments to fund investments to new borrowers that were not current portfolio companies as of such date. As of December 31, 2016, we had additional unfunded commitments of $50.0 million to fund investments to new borrowers that were not current portfolio companies as of such date.\n \u2022 A rating of 5 indicates an investment is in default on its interest or principal payments. For these investments, our Adviser reviews the investments on a bi-monthly basis and, where possible, pursues workouts that achieve an early resolution to avoid further deterioration. The Adviser retains legal counsel and takes actions to preserve our rights, which may include working with the portfolio company to have the default cured, to have the investment restructured or to have the investment repaid through a consensual workout. \nTransfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the quarter in which the transfers occur. In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, we apply the valuation policy approved by our Board that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, we evaluate the source of inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. When a security is valued based on prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services (that is, broker quotes), we subject those prices to various criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular investment would qualify for treatment as a Level 2 or Level 3 investment. For example, we review pricing methodologies provided by dealers or pricing services in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs. Some additional factors considered include the number of prices obtained, as well as an assessment as to their quality.\n \u2022 directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums; \nWe evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not\u201d threshold are reversed and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2017, the Company did not have any uncertain tax positions that met the recognition or measurement criteria, nor did the Company have any unrecognized tax benefits. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. The Company's 2016, 2015 and 2014 tax year returns remain subject to examination by the relevant federal, state, and local tax authorities.\nThe indentures governing the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes contain certain covenants, including covenants requiring us to comply with the requirement under the 1940 Act that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the 1940 Act, equal at least 200% and to provide financial information to the holders of the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes under certain circumstances. These covenants are subject to important limitations and exceptions that are described in the indentures governing the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with the terms of the indentures governing the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes.\n \u2022 Level 1-Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. \nThe Company 10b5-1 Plan expired in accordance with its terms on June 30, 2015. On August 4, 2015, the Board authorized us to enter into a new stock repurchase plan, on substantially the same terms as the prior stock repurchase plan, over an initial six month period, and has continued to authorize extensions of the plan termination date prior to its expiration since that time. On February 21, 2018, the Board authorized the extension of the termination date of the Company 10b5-1 Plan to August 31, 2018. Unless extended or terminated by the Board, the Company 10b5-1 Plan will be in effect through the earlier of August 31, 2018 or such time as the current approved repurchase amount of up to $50 million has been fully utilized, subject to certain conditions.\nTSSP, with approximately $20 billion of assets under management as of September 30, 2017, is TPG's special situations and credit platform and encompasses TPG Specialty Lending, TPG Opportunities Partners and TSSP Adjacent Opportunities Partners, which invest in special situations and distressed investments across the credit cycle, TSL Europe, which is aimed at European middle-market loan originations, and TPG Institutional Credit Partners, which is a public-side\u201d credit investment platform focused on investment opportunities in broadly syndicated leveraged loan markets. TSSP has extensive experience with highly complex, global public and private investments executed through primary originations, secondary market purchases and restructurings, and has a team of over 180 investment and operating professionals. As of December 31, 2017, thirty one (31) of these personnel are dedicated to our business, including twenty four (24) investment professionals.\nMarket Trends\nHolders may convert their 2019 Convertible Senior Notes at their option at any time prior to June 15, 2019 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2014 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period, or the measurement period, in which the trading price (as defined in the indenture governing the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes) per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.\nOur accounting policy on the fair value of our investments is critical because the determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of these valuations, and any change in these valuations, on the consolidated financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOperating results for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\n \u2022 net tax-exempt interest income (which is the excess of our gross tax exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions) for such taxable year. \n (1) The amount available reflects any limitations related to the respective debt facilities' borrowing bases. \n \u2022 Level 3-Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. \nOur shares are currently listed on the NYSE under the symbol TSLX.\u201d\nOn March 3, 2016, we issued 5,000,000 shares of common stock at $16.42 per share. Net of underwriting fees and offering costs, we received total cash proceeds of $78.3 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 we had $66.7 million in unrealized appreciation on 43 portfolio company investments, which was offset by $48.9 million in unrealized depreciation on 32 portfolio company investments. Unrealized appreciation for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from an increase in fair value, primarily due to reversal of prior period unrealized depreciation, positive valuation adjustments and tightening credit spreads. Unrealized depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from the reversal of prior period unrealized appreciation on realized investments and in some instances negative credit-related adjustments.\nFor the calendar years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 we recorded a net expense of $2.8 million, $2.2 million and $1.5 million, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax.\nThe following tables show the fair value and amortized cost of our performing and non-accrual investments as of December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n \u2022 The Adviser's management reviews the preliminary valuations with the investment professionals. Agreed-upon valuation recommendations are presented to the Audit Committee. \nOn February 20, 2018, we entered into an amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility. Under the terms of the amendment, aggregate commitments under the facility were increased to $990 million. In addition, with respect to $895 million in commitments, amounts drawn under the facility bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of either 1.75% or 1.875%, or the prime rate plus a margin of either 0.75% or 0.875%. With respect to $95 million in commitments, amounts drawn under the facility bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of either 1.75% or 2.00%, or the prime rate plus a margin of either 0.75% or 1.00%.\n\n \u2022 investments in portfolio companies and other investments and to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements; \n \u2022 the markets in which the portfolio company does business; \nOn or after June 15, 2019 until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any of the foregoing circumstances.\nOn December 16, 2014, we were granted an exemptive order from the SEC that allows us to co-invest, subject to certain conditions and to the extent the size of an investment opportunity exceeds the amount our Adviser has independently determined is appropriate to invest, with affiliates of TSSP and TPG in middle-market loan origination activities for companies domiciled in the United States and certain follow-on\u201d investments in companies in which we have already co-invested pursuant to the order and remain invested.\nHedging\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had net realized losses on investments of $14.3 million, $0.8 million and $5.0 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had net realized gains on interest rate swaps of $1.8 million. We did not have realized gains or losses on interest rate swaps for the years ended December 31, 2017 or 2016. For both the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2015, we had net realized gains on foreign currency transactions of less than $0.1 million, respectively, and net realized losses on foreign currency transactions of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of translating foreign currency related to our non-USD denominated investments. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had net realized losses on foreign currency investments of $4.9 million, $10.9 million, $0.4 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 we had net realized gains on foreign currency borrowings of $5.2 million, $11.8 million and $0.4 million, respectively.\nIntroduction\nThe Revolving Credit Facility includes customary events of default, as well as customary covenants, including restrictions on certain distributions and financial covenants requiring:\nThe weighted average yields and interest rates of our performing debt investments at fair value as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\n (1) Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more or when management has reasonable doubt that the borrower will pay principal or interest in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest has been paid and, in management's judgment, the borrower is likely to make principal and interest payments in the future. Management may determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if, notwithstanding any failure to pay, the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. See -Critical Accounting Policies - Interest and Dividend Recognition.\u201d \nU.S. Federal Income Taxes\nWe conduct this valuation process on a quarterly basis.\n \u2022 costs of preparing financial statements and maintaining books and records and filing reports or other documents with the SEC (or other regulatory bodies) and other reporting and compliance costs, and the compensation of professionals responsible for the preparation of the foregoing, including the allocable portion of the compensation of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other professionals who spend time on those related activities (based on the percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs); \nWe apply Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurement ( ASC 820\u201d), as amended, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC 820 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820, we consider our principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820 specifies a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in determination of fair value. In accordance with ASC 820, these levels are summarized below:\n \u2022 attendance at, and participation in, board meetings; and \nOther Commitments and Contingencies\nResults of Operations\nProfessional Fees and Other General and Administrative Expenses\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\n \u2022 a liquidity test under which we must not maintain cash and liquid investments of less than 10% of the covered debt amount for more than 30 consecutive business days under circumstances where our adjusted covered debt balance is greater than 90% of our adjusted borrowing base under the facility; and \nAverage gross IRR on our exited investments reflects only invested and realized cash amounts as described above, and does not reflect any unrealized gains or losses in our portfolio.\n \u2022 transfer agent and custodial fees; \nWe currently do not limit our focus to any specific industry and we may invest in larger or smaller companies on occasion. We classify the industries of our portfolio companies by end-market (such as healthcare, and business services) and not by the products or services (such as software) directed to those end-markets.\nThe limited number of providers is further exacerbated by the specialized due diligence and underwriting capabilities, as well as extensive ongoing monitoring, required for middle-market lending. We believe middle-market lending is generally more labor-intensive than lending to larger companies due to smaller investment sizes and the lack of publicly available information on these companies.\nWe focus primarily on the direct origination of loans to middle-market companies domiciled in the United States.\nThe Company 10b5-1 Plan is designed to allow us to repurchase our common stock at times when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws. The Company 10b5-1 Plan requires Goldman, Sachs & Co., as our agent, to repurchase shares of common stock on our behalf when the market price per share is below the most recently reported net asset value per share (including any updates, corrections or adjustments publicly announced by us to any previously announced net asset value per share). Under the Company 10b5-1 Plan, the agent will increase the volume of purchases made as the price of our common stock declines, subject to volume restrictions. The timing and amount of any stock repurchases will depend on the terms and conditions of the Company 10b5-1 Plan, the market price of our common stock and trading volumes, and no assurance can be given that any particular amount of common stock will be repurchased.\nChanges in our net investment income are primarily driven by the spread between the payments we receive from our investments in our portfolio companies against our cost of funding, rather than by changes in interest rates. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of floating rate loans, and our credit facilities and Convertible Senior Notes, after taking into account the effect of the interest rate swaps we have entered into in connection with the Convertible Senior Notes, all bear interest at floating rates. Macro trends in base interest rates like LIBOR may affect our net investment income over the long term. However, because we generally originate loans to a small number of portfolio companies each quarter, and those investments also vary in size, our results in any given period-including the interest rate on investments that were sold or repaid in a period compared to the interest rate of new investments made during that period-often are idiosyncratic, and reflect the characteristics of the particular portfolio companies that we invested in or exited during the period and not necessarily any trends in our business.\n \u2022 the requirement to distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year at least 90% of our investment company taxable income and tax-exempt interest for that taxable year. \n \u2022 Level 2-Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. \nAs of December 31, 2017, aggregate commitments under the facility were $975 million. The facility includes an uncommitted accordion feature that allows us, under certain circumstances, to increase the size of the facility to up to $1.25 billion.\nPortfolio Company Commitments\n \u2022 the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our stockholders (including printing and mailing costs), the costs of any stockholders' meetings and the compensation of investor relations personnel responsible for the preparation of the foregoing and related matters; \nUnder the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement, the Adviser's services are not exclusive, and the Adviser is free to furnish similar or other services to others, so long as its services to us are not impaired. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, we will pay the Adviser the base management fee, or the Management Fee, and may also pay certain incentive fees, or the Incentive Fees.\nThe Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Adviser monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. The Adviser has a number of methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we made new investment commitments of $718.7 million in 20 new portfolio companies and 14 existing portfolio companies. For this period, we had $385.2 million aggregate principal amount in exits and repayments.\n \u2022 a comparison of the portfolio company's securities to any similar publicly traded securities; and \nThe Board undertakes a multi-step valuation process, which includes, among other procedures, the following:\nSince we began investing in 2011 through December 31, 2017, weighted by capital invested, our exited investments have generated an average realized gross internal rate of return to us of 18.8% (based on total capital invested of $2.6 billion and total proceeds from these exited investments of $3.2 billion). Eighty eight percent of these exited investments resulted in a realized gross internal rate of return to us of 10% or greater.\n \u2022 commissions and other compensation payable to brokers or dealers; \nAs a RIC, we (but not our stockholders) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on investment company taxable income and net capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders.\n \u2022 100% of any income or gains recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years. \n (2) The carrying values of the Revolving Credit Facility and 2019 Convertible Senior Notes are presented net of deferred financing costs of $8.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively. \n\nOur accounting policy on interest and dividend income recognition is critical because it involves the primary source of our revenue and accordingly is significant to the financial results as disclosed in our consolidated financial statements.\nUnder the Administration Agreement, our Adviser furnishes us with office facilities and equipment, provides us clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities and provides us with other administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. We reimburse our Adviser for the allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of our Board) of expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions and our allocable portion of the compensation of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other professionals who spend time on those related activities (based on a percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs). Our Adviser also offers on our behalf significant managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to offer to provide such assistance.\nOur Investment Framework\n \u2022 amounts payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making or holding investments; \nInvestment transactions purchased on a secondary basis are recorded on the trade date. Loan originations are recorded on the date of the binding commitment, which is generally the funding date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds received (excluding prepayment fees, if any) and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. The net change in unrealized gains or losses primarily reflects the change in investment values and also includes the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses with respect to investments realized during the period.\nWe have in place a stock repurchase plan, the Company 10b5-1 Plan, to acquire up to $50 million in the aggregate of our common stock at prices below our net asset value per share over a specified period, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. We put the Company 10b5-1 Plan in place because we believe that if our common stock is trading below our then-current net asset value, it is in the best interest of our stockholders for us to reinvest in our portfolio and increase our leverage ratio through share repurchases.\nWhile we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in the manner necessary to minimize imposition of the 4% U.S. federal excise tax, sufficient amounts of our taxable income and capital gains may not be distributed to avoid entirely the imposition of this tax. In that event, we will be liable for this tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement.\n \u2022 indemnification payments; \nAmounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax payable by us. To avoid this tax, we must distribute (or be treated as distributing) during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of:\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWhen an external event, such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Board considers whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates our valuation.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our portfolio based on fair value consisted of 93.4% first-lien debt investments, 3.6% second-lien debt investments, and 3.0% equity and other investments. As of December 31, 2016, our portfolio based on fair value consisted of 96.5% first-lien debt investments, 1.2% second-lien debt investments, 0.6% mezzanine and unsecured debt investments, and 1.7% equity and other investments.\n2023 Notes\n \u2022 The Audit Committee reviews the valuations presented and recommends values for each investment to the Board. \n \u2022 debt service, repayment, and other financing costs; and \nInterest expense, including other debt financing expenses, increased from $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $27.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the average 1-month LIBOR rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 0.5% to 1.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and an increase in our average interest rate on debt outstanding due to a change in the mix of our debt financing sources. The average interest rate on our debt outstanding increased from 2.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 3.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the increase in LIBOR and a change in the mix of our debt financing sources.\nWe have certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Adviser provides us with investment advisory and management services. For these services, we pay the Management Fee and the Incentive Fee.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 we had $9.0 million in unrealized appreciation on 15 portfolio company investments, which was offset by $43.3 million in unrealized depreciation on 40 portfolio company investments. Unrealized appreciation for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted from an increase in fair value, primarily due to positive valuation adjustments. Unrealized depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted from widening in credit spreads, the reversal of prior period unrealized appreciation and in some instances negative credit-related adjustments.\n\nAn imbalance between the supply of, and demand for, middle-market debt capital creates attractive pricing dynamics for investors such as BDCs. The negotiated nature of middle-market financings also generally provides for more favorable terms to the lenders, including stronger covenant and reporting packages, better call protection and lender-protective change of control provisions. We believe that BDCs have flexibility to develop loans that reflect each borrower's distinct situation, provide long-term relationships and a potential source for future capital, which renders BDCs, including us, attractive lenders.\nWhile as a BDC the amount of leverage that we are permitted to use is limited in significant respects, we use leverage to increase our ability to make investments. The amount of leverage we use in any period depends on a variety of factors, including cash available for investing, the cost of financing and general economic and market conditions, however, our total borrowings are limited so that our asset coverage ratio cannot fall below 200% immediately after any borrowing, as defined in the 1940 Act. In any period, our interest expense will depend largely on the extent of our borrowing and we expect interest expense will increase as we increase leverage over time within the limits of the 1940 Act. In addition, we may dedicate assets as collateral to financing facilities from time to time.\nUnder the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Adviser also provides administrative services to us. These services include providing office space, equipment and office services, maintaining financial records, preparing reports to stockholders and reports filed with the SEC, and managing the payment of expenses and the oversight of the performance of administrative and professional services rendered by others. Certain of these services are reimbursable to the Adviser under the terms of the Administration Agreement.\nInterest from investments, which includes amortization of upfront fees and prepayment fees, increased from $177.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $200.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase in accelerated amortization of upfront fees and prepayment fees. Accelerated amortization of upfront fees, primarily from unscheduled paydowns, increased from $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and prepayment fees increased from $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The accelerated amortization and prepayment fees primarily resulted from full paydowns on seven portfolio investments, a partial paydown on one portfolio investment and prepayment fees on four portfolio investments during the year ended December 31, 2016, and full paydowns on 22 portfolio investments, partial paydowns on seven portfolio investments and prepayment fees on 12 portfolio investments during the year ended December 31, 2017. Dividend income decreased from $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to a partial realization of dividend yielding investments in 2017. Other income decreased from $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to lower syndication, amendment and agency fees earned during 2017.\nAny waived Incentive Fees are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $3.2 million of restricted cash pledged as collateral under our interest rate swap agreements, compared to $1.1 million as of December 31, 2016.\nExpenses\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our investments consisted of the following:\nWe have elected and qualified to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our RIC status, we must distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year dividends for tax purposes equal to at least 90 percent of the sum of our:\n \u2022 assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants; \nThe Convertible Senior Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to our future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Senior Notes; equal in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities.\n \u2022 The Board reviews the recommended valuations and determines the fair value of each investment; valuations that are not based on readily available market quotations are valued in good faith based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, Audit Committee and, where applicable, other third parties. \nIn connection with the offering, we entered into an interest rate swap to better align the interest rates of our liabilities with our investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans. As a result of the swap, our effective interest rate on the 2023 Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 199 basis points. The swap transaction matures on January 22, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $6.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we provided $82.4 million in cash for operating activities, primarily as a result of proceeds from investments of $103.6 million, repayments on investments of $922.5 million, and an increase in net assets resulting from operations of $111.6 million, which was partially offset by funding portfolio investments of $1,028.0 million and other operating activity of $27.3 million. Lastly, cash used in financing activities was $81.7 million during the period, primarily due to paydowns on our Revolving Credit Facility of $1,171.6 million, dividends paid of $94.7 million, and deferred financing costs of $3.9 million, which were partially offset by borrowings of $1,188.5 million (including the issuance of $115.0 million principal amount of our 2022 Convertible Senior Notes).\nFor the periods December 31, 2016 and prior, the Adviser voluntarily waived the Incentive Fees attributable to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income accrued by us as a result of our ownership of the TICC Shares. The Adviser has not waived any part of the Incentive Fee related to capital gains and losses attributable to our ownership of the TICC Shares and, accordingly, any realized capital gains or losses and unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation with respect to the TICC Shares applies towards our cumulative realized capital gains on which the Incentive Fee related to capital gains and losses is calculated.\n\n (1) Includes two fixed rate investments for the year ended December 31, 2017 and one fixed rate investment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 for which we entered into interest rate swap agreements to swap to floating rates. \nAs of December 31, 2017, the largest industry represented 14.0% of our total investment portfolio based on fair value.\nNet proceeds received from our common stock issuance in March 2016, and net proceeds received from the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes and the 2023 Notes were used to pay down borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility.\n2019 Convertible Senior Notes\nAs of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had investments in 45 and 52 portfolio companies, respectively, with an aggregate fair value of $1,693.7 million and $1,657.4 million, respectively.\nThe limited number of dedicated providers of capital to middle-market companies, combined with increases in required capital levels for regulated financial institutions, reduces the capacity of traditional lenders to serve middle-market companies. We believe that the limited availability of capital creates a significant opportunity for us to directly originate investments. We also believe that the large amount of uninvested capital held by private equity firms will continue to drive deal activity, which may in turn create additional demand for debt capital.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the principal amount of the 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes exceeded the value of the underlying shares multiplied by the per share closing price of our common stock.\nExecutive Officer and our Adviser's Co-Chief Investment Officer Joshua Easterly and our Adviser's Co-Chief Investment Officer Alan Waxman, both of whom have substantial experience in credit origination, underwriting and asset management. Our investment decisions are made by our Investment Review Committee, which includes senior personnel of our Adviser and TPG Sixth Street Partners, or TSSP.\nIncentive Fees\n \u2022 The valuation process begins with each investment being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment in conjunction with the portfolio management team. \n \u2022 the cost of operations (including paying our Adviser); \n \u2022 calculating individual asset values and our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firms); \nOverview\n \u2022 the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company (that is, the total fair value of the portfolio company's debt and equity); \nThe Company 10b5-1 Plan is designed to allow us to repurchase our common stock at times when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws. The Company 10b5-1 Plan requires Goldman, Sachs & Co., as our agent, to repurchase shares of common stock on our behalf when the market price per share is below the most recently reported net asset value per share (including any updates, corrections or adjustments publicly announced by us to any previously announced net asset value per share). Under the Company 10b5-1 Plan, the agent will increase the volume of purchases made as the price of our common stock declines, subject to volume restrictions. The timing and amount of any stock repurchases will depend on the terms and conditions of the Company 10b5-1 Plan, the market price of our common stock and trading volumes, and no assurance can be given that any particular amount of common stock will be repurchased.\nOur Adviser consults with TSSP and TPG in connection with a substantial number of our investments. The TSSP and TPG platforms provide us with a breadth of large and scalable investment resources. We believe we benefit from their market expertise, insights into sector and macroeconomic trends and intensive due diligence capabilities, which help us discern market conditions that vary across industries and credit cycles, identify favorable investment opportunities and manage our portfolio of investments. TSSP and TPG will refer all middle-market loan origination activities for companies domiciled in the United States to us and conduct those activities through us. The Adviser will determine whether it would be permissible, advisable or otherwise appropriate for us to pursue a particular investment opportunity allocated to us by TSSP and TPG.\nIn June 2014, we issued in a private offering $115 million aggregate principal amount convertible senior notes due December 2019, or the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes. The 2019 Convertible Senior Notes were issued in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The 2019 Convertible Senior Notes are unsecured and bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year, payable semiannually. The 2019 Convertible Senior Notes will mature on December 15, 2019. In certain circumstances, the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election, at an initial conversion rate of 38.7162 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2019 Convertible Senior Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $25.83 per share of our common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. As of December 31, 2017, the estimated adjusted conversion price was approximately $25.41. The sale of the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes generated net proceeds of approximately $110.8 million. We used the net proceeds of the offering to pay down debt under the Revolving Credit Facility. In connection with the offering of 2019 Convertible Senior Notes, we have entered into interest rate swaps to continue to align the interest rates of our liabilities with our investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans. As a result of the swaps, our effective interest rate on the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 286 basis points.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\n \u2022 98% of our net ordinary income excluding certain ordinary gains or losses for that calendar year; \n \u2022 An investment is rated 2 if it is performing as agreed, but, in the opinion of the Adviser, there may be concerns about the company's operating performance or trends in the industry. For these investments, in addition to monthly reports and quarterly asset reviews, the Adviser also researches any areas of concern with the objective of early intervention with the portfolio company. \nThe purchase of shares pursuant to the Company 10b5-1 Plan is intended to satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, and will otherwise be subject to applicable law, including Regulation M, which may prohibit purchases under certain circumstances.\nInterest expense, including other debt financing expenses, increased from $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average debt outstanding from $540.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $725.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as well an increase in the average 1-month LIBOR rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 0.20% to 0.50% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The average interest rate on our debt outstanding increased from 2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 2.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the increase in LIBOR.\nAs part of the monitoring process, the Adviser regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and, on a quarterly basis, grades each investment on a risk scale of 1 to 5. Risk assessment is not standardized in our industry and our risk assessment may not be comparable to ones used by our competitors. Our assessment is based on the following categories:\n \u2022 overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future. \nInvestments\n \u2022 the Investment Advisory Agreement; \nInvestment Structuring. We focus on investing at the top of the capital structure and protecting that position. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 97.0% of our portfolio was invested in secured debt, including 93.4% in first-lien debt investments. We carefully perform diligence and structure investments to include strong investor covenants. As a result, we structure investments with a view to creating opportunities for early intervention in the event of non-performance or stress. In addition, we seek to retain effective voting control in investments over the loans or particular class of securities in which we invest through maintaining affirmative voting positions or negotiating consent rights that allow us to retain a blocking position. We also aim for our loans to mature on a medium term, between two to six years after origination. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the weighted average term on new investment commitments in new portfolio companies was 4.2 years.\n\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to our Adviser under the Investment Advisory Agreement, expenses reimbursable under the Administration Agreement and other operating costs described below. Additionally, we pay interest expense on our outstanding debt. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including those relating to:\nLoan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income using the effective interest method for term instruments and the straight-line method for revolving or delayed draw instruments. Repayments of our debt investments can reduce interest income from period to period. We record prepayment premiums on loans as interest income when earned. We also may generate revenue in the form of commitment, amendment, structuring, syndication or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. The frequency or volume of these repayments may fluctuate significantly.\nOperating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nRevolving Credit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, our weighted average total yield of debt and income producing securities at fair value (which includes interest income and amortization of fees and discounts) was 10.7% and 10.4%, respectively, and our weighted average total yield of debt and income-producing securities at amortized cost (which includes interest income and amortization of fees and discounts) was 10.8% and 10.4%, respectively.\nOur liquidity and capital resources are derived primarily from proceeds from equity issuances, advances from our credit facilities, and cash flows from operations. The primary uses of our cash and cash equivalents are:\nTPG Specialty Lending, Inc. is a Delaware corporation formed on July 21, 2010. The Adviser is our external manager. We have three wholly owned subsidiaries, TC Lending, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which holds a California finance lender and broker license, TPG SL SPV, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, in which we hold assets that were previously used to support our asset-backed credit facility, and TSL MR, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, in which we hold certain investments.\n \u2022 expenses, including travel expenses, incurred by the Adviser, or members of our Investment Team, or payable to third parties, in respect of due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and, if necessary, in respect of enforcing our rights with respect to investments in existing portfolio companies; \nWe have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We also have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code. So long as we maintain our status as a RIC, we will generally not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income or excise taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute at least annually to our stockholders as dividends. As a result, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by us represents obligations of our stockholders and will not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and as a RIC under the Code. We made our BDC election on April 15, 2011. As a result, we are required to comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements, such as:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we made new investment commitments of $562.7 million in 14 new portfolio companies and 9 existing portfolio companies. For this period, we had $416.5 million aggregate principal amount in exits and repayments.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit up to an aggregate amount of $75 million. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had no outstanding letters of credit issued through the Revolving Credit Facility. The amount available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility is reduced by any letters of credit issued through the Revolving Credit Facility.\n2022 Convertible Senior Notes\nIn addition, as part of our risk strategy on investments, we may reduce certain levels of investments through partial sales or syndication to additional investors.\nDividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies.\nOn November 3, 2014, the Board approved the Company 10b5-1 Plan to acquire up to $50 million in the aggregate of our common stock at prices just below our net asset value over a specified period, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. We put the Company 10b5-1 Plan in place because we believe that, in current market conditions, if our common stock is trading below our then-current net asset value, it is in the best interest of our stockholders for us to reinvest in our portfolio and increase our leverage ratio through share repurchases.\nWe believe our ability to co-invest with TSSP and TPG affiliates is particularly useful where we identify larger capital commitments than otherwise would be appropriate for us. We expect that with the ability to co-invest with TSSP and TPG affiliates we will continue to be able to provide one-stop\u201d financing to a potential portfolio company in these circumstances, which may allow us to capture opportunities where we alone could not commit the full amount of required capital or would have to spend additional time to locate unaffiliated co-investors.\nThrough our Adviser, we consider potential investments utilizing a four-tiered investment framework and against our existing portfolio as a whole:\n \u2022 investment company taxable income (which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid, for such taxable year; and \n \u2022 Independent Director fees and expenses; \n \u2022 a license agreement with an affiliate of TPG under which the affiliate granted us a non-exclusive license to use the TPG name and logo, for a nominal fee, for so long as the Adviser or one of its affiliates remains our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the TPG\u201d name or logo. \nIncome Taxes, Including Excise Taxes\nDebt obligations consisted of the following as of December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nBusiness and sector selection. We focus on companies with enterprise value between $50 million and $1 billion. When reviewing potential investments, we seek to invest in businesses with high marginal cash flow, recurring revenue streams and where we believe credit quality will improve over time. We look for portfolio companies that we think have a sustainable competitive advantage in growing industries or distressed situations. We also seek companies where our investment will have a low loan-to-value ratio.\nSee Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information on the fair value of our investments.\n \u2022 stockholders' equity of at least $500 million plus 25% of the net proceeds of the sale of equity interests after December 22, 2016. \n \u2022 review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies. \nThe following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 investment performance rating scale at fair value as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. Investment performance ratings are accurate only as of those dates and may change due to subsequent developments relating to a portfolio company's business or financial condition, market conditions or developments, and other factors.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had unrealized depreciation on foreign currency borrowings of $11.5 million and $3.6 million, respectively, primarily as a result of fluctuations in the GBP and EUR exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2017 and GBP, SEK and EUR exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we\n (2) The carrying values of the Revolving Credit Facility and 2019 and 2022 Convertible Senior Notes are presented net of deferred financing costs of $7.1 million, $1.5 million and $3.2 million, respectively. \nRelated-Party Transactions\nExpenses\nInvestment Income\n (1) Includes fixed rate investments for which we entered into interest rate swap agreements to swap to floating rates. \n \u2022 all other expenses reasonably incurred by us in connection with making investments and administering our business. \nOur Adviser is a Delaware limited liability company. Our Adviser acts as our investment adviser and administrator and is a registered investment adviser with the SEC under the Advisers Act. Our Adviser sources and manages our portfolio through a dedicated team of investment professionals predominately focused on us. Our Investment Team is led by our Chairman and Chief\nAs part of the valuation process, the Board takes into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of our investments, including:\n (1) Includes foreign exchange hedging activity. \n \u2022 an asset coverage ratio of no less than 2 to 1 on the last day of any fiscal quarter; \nWe have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:\nWe are a specialty finance company focused on lending to middle-market companies. Since we began our investment activities in July 2011, through December 31, 2017, we have originated more than $7.3 billion aggregate principal amount of investments and retained approximately $4.4 billion aggregate principal amount of these investments on our balance sheet prior to any subsequent exits and repayments. We seek to generate current income primarily in U.S.-domiciled middle-market companies through direct originations of senior secured loans and, to a lesser extent, originations of mezzanine and unsecured loans and investments in corporate bonds and equity securities.\nCapital invested, with respect to an investment, represents the aggregate cost basis allocable to the realized or unrealized portion of the investment, net of any upfront fees paid at closing for the term loan portion of the investment. Capital invested also includes realized losses on hedging activity, with respect to an investment, which represents any inception-to-date realized losses on foreign currency forward contracts allocable to the investment, if any.\nIncentive Fees (net of waivers) related to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income increased from $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $22.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase resulted from the increase in the size of the portfolio and related increase in net investment income. Incentive Fees waived related to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income increased from $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, consisting solely of Incentive Fees attributable to our ownership of the TICC Shares. There were no Incentive Fees related to capital gains and losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2016 due to realized and unrealized losses on our investments.\nInterest\nWe invest in first-lien debt, second-lien debt, mezzanine and unsecured debt and equity and other investments. Our first-lien debt may include stand-alone first-lien loans; last out\u201d first-lien loans, which are loans that have a secondary priority behind super-senior first out\u201d first-lien loans; unitranche\u201d loans, which are loans that combine features of first-lien, second-lien and mezzanine debt, generally in a first-lien position; and secured corporate bonds with similar features to these categories of first-lien loans. Our second-lien debt may include secured loans, and, to a lesser extent, secured corporate bonds, with a secondary priority behind first-lien debt.\n\n \u2022 the costs of any public offerings of our common stock and other securities, including registration and listing fees; \nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we made new investment commitments of $1,072.6 million in 22 new portfolio companies and 12 existing portfolio companies. For this period, we had $951.5 million aggregate principal amount in exits and repayments.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we also issued 530,996 and 638,326 shares of our common stock, respectively, to investors who have not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan for proceeds of $10.2 million and $10.3 million, respectively. On January 12, 2018, we issued 153,295 shares of our common stock through our dividend reinvestment plan for proceeds of $2.9 million, which is not reflected in the number of shares issued for the year ended December 31, 2017 in this section or the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe maturity of the facility was also extended. With respect to $895 million in commitments, the revolving period ends in February 2022 and the stated maturity date is February 2023. For the remaining $95 million of commitments, the revolving period ends in either October 2019 or December 2020, and the stated maturity date is either October 2020 or December 2021. Under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, we may at any time determine to cancel the commitments that were not extended.\nRisk Mitigation. We seek to mitigate non-credit-related risk on our returns in several ways, including call protection provisions to protect future interest income. As of December 31, 2017, we had call protection on 91.2% of our debt investments based on fair value, with weighted average call prices of 106.2% for the first year, 103.2% for the second year and 101.4% for the third year, in each case from the date of the initial investment. As of December 31, 2017, 100.0% of our debt investments based on fair value bore interest at floating rates (when including investment specific hedges), with 93.3% of these subject to interest rate floors, which we believe helps act as a portfolio-wide hedge against inflation.\nWe intend to distribute annually all or substantially all of such income. To the extent that we retain our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income, we generally will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. We may choose to retain our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income, and pay the U.S. federal excise tax described below.\n \u2022 An investment is rated 1 if, in the opinion of the Adviser, it is performing as agreed and there are no concerns about the portfolio company's performance or ability to meet covenant requirements. For these investments, the Adviser generally prepares monthly reports on investment performance and intensive quarterly asset reviews. \nInterest and Dividend Income Recognition\nInvestments at Fair Value\nAverage gross IRR is the average of the gross IRR for each of our exited investments (each calculated as described above), weighted by the total capital invested for each of those investments.\nRealized Gross Internal Rate of Return\nWe generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate income from dividends on direct equity investments, capital gains on the sale of investments and various loan origination and other fees. Our debt investments typically have a term of two to six years, and, as of December 31, 2017, 100.0% of these investments based on fair value bore interest at a floating rate (when including investment specific hedges), with 93.3% of these subject to interest rate floors. Interest on debt investments is generally payable quarterly or semiannually. Some of our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. For the year ended December 31, 2017, 2.8% of our total investment income was comprised of PIK interest.\nOn August 23, 2012, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement with SunTrust Bank, as administrative agent, and J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, and certain other lenders (as amended, the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d).\nOur accounting policy on income taxes is critical because if we are unable to maintain our status as a RIC, we would be required to record a provision for corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes which may be significant to our financial results.\nAs of December 31, 2017, amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility, including amounts drawn in respect of letters of credit, bore interest at either LIBOR plus a margin of either 1.75% or 2.00%, or the prime rate plus a margin of either 0.75% or 1.00%, in each case, based on the total amount of the borrowing base relative to the sum of the total commitments (or, if greater, the total exposure) under the Revolving Credit Facility plus certain other designated secured debt. We may elect either the LIBOR or prime rate at the time of drawdown, and loans may be converted from one rate to another at any time, subject to certain conditions. We also pay a fee of 0.375% on undrawn amounts and, in respect of each undrawn letter of credit, a fee and interest rate equal to the then-applicable margin while the letter of credit is outstanding.\nGross IRR reflects historical results relating to our past performance and is not necessarily indicative of our future results. In addition, gross IRR does not reflect the effect of Management Fees, expenses, Incentive Fees or taxes borne, or to be borne, by us or our stockholders, and would be lower if it did.\n \u2022 the Management Fee and any Incentive Fee; \nAs of December 31, 2017, with respect to $915 million in commitments, the revolving period, during which period we, subject to certain conditions, may make borrowings under the facility, ended December 22, 2020 and the stated maturity date was December 22, 2021. For the remaining $60 million of commitments, the revolving period ended October 2, 2019 and the stated maturity date was October 2, 2020.\nInvestments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at those market quotations. To validate market quotations, we utilize a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available, as is the case for substantially all of our investments, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board, based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, our Audit Committee and independent third-party valuation firms engaged at the direction of the Board.\nIn addition, the Adviser voluntarily waived the Incentive Fees attributable to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income accrued by us as a result of our ownership of the TCAP Shares. The Adviser has not waived any part of the Incentive Fee related to capital gains and losses attributable to our ownership of the TCAP Shares and, accordingly, any realized capital gains or losses and unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation with respect to the TCAP Shares applies towards our cumulative realized capital gains on which the Incentive Fee related to capital gains and losses is calculated.\nIn connection with debt and equity securities that are valued at fair value in good faith by the Board, the Board has engaged independent third-party valuation firms to perform certain limited procedures that the Board has identified and requested them to perform.\n \u2022 the Administration Agreement; and \nContractual Obligations\nWe may borrow amounts in U.S. dollars or certain other permitted currencies. As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding debt denominated in Euro (EUR) of 59.4 million on our Revolving Credit Facility, included in the Outstanding Principal amount in the table above.\n \u2022 the Adviser's allocable share of costs incurred in providing significant managerial assistance to those portfolio companies that request it; \nIn January 2018, we issued $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on January 22, 2023 (the 2023 Notes\u201d). The principal amount of the 2023 Notes is payable at maturity. The 2023 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year, payable semi-annually commencing on July 22, 2018, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option at any time at par plus a make whole\u201d premium. Total proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Notes, net of underwriting discounts and estimated offering costs, were approximately $147.1 million. We used the net proceeds of the 2023 Notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we can be expected to carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year dividend distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such income, we accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income.\n \u2022 An investment will be assigned a rating of 3 if it is paying as agreed but a material covenant violation is expected. For these investments, in addition to monthly reports and quarterly asset reviews, the Adviser also adds the investment to its watch list\u201d and researches any areas of concern with the objective of early intervention with the portfolio company. \nOur current approach to hedging the foreign currency exposure in our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments is primarily to borrow the par amount in local currency under our Revolving Credit Facility to fund these investments. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had $11.5 million and $3.6 million of realized losses and $6.3 million of unrealized gains, respectively, on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated debt into U.S. dollars; such amounts approximate the corresponding unrealized gains and losses on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments into U.S. dollars for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. See Note 2 for additional disclosure regarding our accounting for foreign currency. See Note 7 for additional disclosure regarding the amounts of outstanding debt denominated in each foreign currency at December 31, 2017. See our consolidated schedule of investments for additional disclosure regarding the foreign currency amounts (in both par and fair value) of our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with ITEM 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\u201d Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\n \u2022 debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; \nManagement Fees (net of waivers) increased from $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Management Fees remained flat at $24.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017 due to total assets remaining $1.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017. Management Fees waived decreased from $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to owning investments subject to fee waivers for a shorter period in 2017 than 2016. Management Fees waived during the year ended December 31, 2016 were solely attributable to our ownership of TICC Shares. Management Fees waived during the year ended December 31, 2017 were solely attributable to our ownership of TCAP Shares.\nBy middle-market companies,\u201d we mean companies that have annual EBITDA, which we believe is a useful proxy for cash flow, of $10 million to $250 million, although we may invest in larger or smaller companies on occasion. As of December 31, 2017, our core portfolio companies, which excludes certain investments that fall outside of our typical borrower profile and represent 83.2% of our total investments based on fair value, had weighted average annual revenue of $130.3 million and weighted average annual EBITDA of $25.1 million.\nNet Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses\nThe Adviser has voluntarily waived the Management Fee on our ownership of the TCAP Shares for any period in which Triangle Capital Corp. remains our portfolio company. Any waived Management Fees are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser. For the period ended December 31, 2016 and prior, the Adviser voluntarily waived the Management Fee on our ownership of the TICC Shares. Any waived Management Fees are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser. Following our IPO, with the exception of its waiver of Management Fees attributable to our ownership of the TCAP Shares and TICC Shares, the Adviser has not waived its right to receive the full Management Fee payable pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement.\nLeverage\nWe have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our stockholders in each taxable year generally at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. To maintain our RIC status, we, among other things, have made and intend to continue to make the requisite distributions to our stockholders, which generally relieve us from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes.\n \u2022 direct costs and expenses of administration, including audit, accounting, consulting and legal costs; and \nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 we had $56.7 million in unrealized appreciation on 48 portfolio company investments, which was offset by $23.0 million in unrealized depreciation on 10 portfolio company investments. Unrealized appreciation for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted from an increase in fair value, primarily due to positive valuation adjustments and tightening credit spreads. Unrealized depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted from the reversal of prior period unrealized appreciation on realized investments and in some instances negative credit-related adjustments.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the terms of our debt arrangements. We intend to continue to utilize our credit facilities to fund investments and for other general corporate purposes.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn addition to interest income, our net investment income is also driven by prepayment and other fees, which also can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. The level of prepayment fees is generally correlated to the movement in credit spreads and risk premiums, but also will vary based on corporate events that may take place at an individual portfolio company in a given period-e.g., merger and acquisition activity, initial public offerings and restructurings. As noted above, generally a small but varied number of portfolio companies may make prepayments in any quarter, meaning that changes in the amount of prepayment fees received can vary significantly between periods and can vary without regard to underlying credit trends.\nGross IRR, with respect to an investment, is calculated based on the dates that we invested capital and dates we received distributions, regardless of when we made distributions to our stockholders. Initial investments are assumed to occur at time zero, and all cash flows are deemed to occur on the fifteenth of each month in which they occur.\n\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nThe following table summarizes our net realized and unrealized gains (losses) for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nInterest income is recorded on an accrual basis and includes the amortization of discounts and premiums. Discounts and premiums to par value on securities purchased are amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the respective security using the effective yield method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the amortization of discounts and premiums, if any.\nManagement Fees (net of waivers) increased from $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Management Fees increased from $21.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the increase in total assets, which increased from an average of $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 to an average of $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. Management Fees waived for both the year ended December 31, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2016 were $0.1 million. Management Fees waived during the year ended December 31, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2016 were solely attributable to our ownership of shares of common stock in the TICC Shares.\nWe intend to continue to generate cash primarily from cash flows from operations, future borrowings and future offerings of securities. We may from time to time enter into additional debt facilities, increase the size of existing facilities or issue debt securities. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock if immediately after the borrowing or issuance the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock, is at least 200%. As of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our asset coverage ratio was 235.5%, 237.7%, and 225.7%, respectively. We carefully consider our unfunded commitments for the purpose of planning our capital resources and ongoing liquidity including our financial leverage. Further, we maintain sufficient borrowing capacity within the 200% asset coverage limitation to cover any outstanding unfunded commitments we are required to fund.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into commitments to fund investments. We incorporate these commitments into our assessment of our liquidity position. Our senior secured revolving loan commitments are generally available on a borrower's demand and may remain outstanding until the maturity date of the applicable loan. Our senior secured term loan commitments are generally available on a borrower's demand and, once drawn, generally have the same remaining term as the associated loan agreement. Undrawn senior secured term loan commitments generally have a shorter availability period than the term of the associated loan agreement. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had the following commitments to fund investments in current portfolio companies:\nInternal rate of return, or IRR, is a measure of our discounted cash flows (inflows and outflows). Specifically, IRR is the discount rate at which the net present value of all cash flows is equal to zero. That is, IRR is the discount rate at which the present value of total capital invested in each of our investments is equal to the present value of all realized returns from that investment. Our IRR calculations are unaudited.\n\nThe debt in which we invest typically is not rated by any rating agency, but if these instruments were rated, they would likely receive a rating of below investment grade (that is, below BBB- or Baa3), which is often referred to as junk.\u201d\nWe have adopted an opt out\u201d dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a cash dividend or other distribution, each stockholder that has not opted out\u201d of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock rather than receiving cash dividends. Stockholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions.\n \u2022 administration fees payable under our Administration Agreement; \nTo the extent our current taxable earnings for a year fall below the total amount of our distributions for that year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our stockholders may be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather than our income or gains. Stockholders should read any written disclosure carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains.\nIn February 2017, we issued in a private offering $115 million aggregate principal amount convertible senior notes due August 2022, or the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes. We refer to the 2019 Convertible Senior Notes and the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes collectively as the Convertible Senior Notes. The 2022 Convertible Senior Notes were issued in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The 2022 Convertible Senior Notes are unsecured, and bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year, payable semiannually. The 2022 Convertible Senior Notes will mature on August 1, 2022. In certain circumstances, the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election, at an initial conversion rate of 46.8516 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2022 Convertible Senior Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $21.34 per share of our common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. As of December 31, 2017, the estimated adjusted conversion price was approximately $21.15. The sale of the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes generated net proceeds of approximately $111.2 million. We used the net proceeds of the offering to pay down debt under the Revolving Credit Facility. In connection with the offering of 2022 Convertible Senior Notes, we have entered into an interest rate swap to continue to align the interest rates of our liabilities with our investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans. As a result of the swaps, our effective interest rate on the 2022 Convertible Senior Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 237.2 basis points.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting policies, including those relating to the valuation of our investment portfolio, are described below. The critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our risk factors as disclosed in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\u201d\n (1) The amount available reflects any limitations related to the respective debt facilities' borrowing bases. \n \u2022 comparisons to other companies in the industry; \nIn addition to the contractual payment obligations in the tables above, we also have commitments to fund investments and to pledge assets as collateral under the terms of our derivatives agreements.\nProfessional fees increased from $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to an increase in costs associated with servicing our investment portfolio, as well as additional professional fees incurred relating to our investment in the TICC Shares and related activity. Other general and administrative fees decreased from $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n \u2022 the nature and realizable value of any collateral; \nDividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by TPG SL SPV, LLC, TC Lending, LLC and TSL MR, LLC and may be guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries in the future. The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a perfected first-priority security interest in substantially all the portfolio investments held by us and each guarantor. Proceeds from borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of portfolio investments.\nhad unrealized appreciation on foreign currency borrowings of $6.3 million, primarily as a result of fluctuations in the GBP, SEK and EUR exchange rates. For both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had unrealized appreciation on foreign currency cash and forward contracts of less than $0.1 million, primarily as a result of settling our foreign currency forward contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had unrealized depreciation on foreign currency cash and forward contracts of less than $0.1 million, primarily as a result of settling our foreign currency forward contracts. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had unrealized depreciation on interest rate swaps of $1.0 million, $0.3 million, and $0.5 million, respectively, due to fluctuations in interest rates.\n \u2022 98.2% of our capital gain net income, adjusted for certain ordinary gains and losses, recognized for the twelve-month period ending on October 31 of that calendar year; and \nWe expect that during periods of asset growth, our general and administrative expenses will be relatively stable or will decline as a percentage of total assets, and will increase as a percentage of

middle-market companies. Since 2011, it has originated over $7.3 billion in investments and retained about $4.4 billion on its balance sheet.\n\nKey Components of Results\n- Revenues are driven primarily by interest income on debt investments, which are typically floating rate with 2-6 year terms. Other income sources are dividends, capital gains, and various fees.\n- Expenses include management and incentive fees paid to the investment adviser, interest expense on debt financings, and other operating costs. \n- Net realized and unrealized gains/losses come from investment exits or changes in fair value.\n\nInvestment Portfolio and Activity \n- As of Dec 2017, the portfolio at fair value was $1.7 billion invested in 45 companies, mostly first-lien debt. Average investment size was $37.6 million.\n- In 2017, $1.1 billion of new commitments were made and $951 million exited the portfolio.  \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n- Capital comes from equity issuances, credit facilities, and operating cash flow. It funds new investments and operations. Asset coverage ratio was 235.5% as of Dec 2017.\n- Has over $475 million available on its credit facility as a source of liquidity.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\n- Valuation of investments, given most are not publicly traded securities. Relies on inputs from investment adviser, Board, and independent valuation firms.\n- Maintenance of RIC tax status. Important for operating without entity-level federal income tax."}
