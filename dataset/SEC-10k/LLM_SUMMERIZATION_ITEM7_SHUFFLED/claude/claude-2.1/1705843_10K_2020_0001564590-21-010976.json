We are a leader in gene editing with exclusive access to proprietary TALEN technology for use in plants, which we used to successfully commercialize the first gene edited food product in the United States. We have a robust development pipeline that spans multiple crops and that is focused on several important trends, including functional nutrition, regenerative agriculture, sustainability, plant-based protein, and animal nutrition.\nOur strategy is based on focusing on our core strengths in research and development, gene editing, and trait development. We deploy a capital-efficient, streamlined business model comprising three differentiated go-to-market strategies. Specific deal structure and the amount and timing of cash flows and revenues are expected to vary depending upon several factors, including cost to develop, size of the opportunity, and the stage at which a partner or licensee enters the development process. Across each of our go-to-market strategies, we seek to develop relationships with strategic customers where our product candidates are most likely to benefit from the counterparty's deep agronomy, product management, and commercialization expertise.\nOur business is described in greater detail in Item 1. Business-Company Overview.\u201d\nSelected Achievements and Developments\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> In August 2020, as part of the broader transition of our business model, we announced a change in the go-to-market strategy for our high oleic soybean products. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we announced that we had contracted to sell all 2020 grain production of our high oleic soybean to Archer Daniels Midland (ADM). The total purchases represent approximately four million bushels of high oleic soybean grain. Sales began in the third quarter of 2020 and will continue throughout 2021, with prices to be determined on the basis of agricultural commodity market prices in effect at the time our planned deliveries of grain are agreed upon.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> In the fourth quarter of 2020, we entered into a research collaboration with NRGene\u00ae that includes the adoption of NRGene's cloud-based genomics platform to support several of our research projects. The genomics solutions, including NRGene's QuickGENETICS\u2122 technology, which analyzes breeding populations, delivers high resolution genetic mapping, and generates unique genetic markers for high value traits, are expected to allow for more comprehensive evaluations to accelerate trait discovery and breeding across multiple crops. We are integrating NRGene's genomic resources to build out our proprietary predictive data analytics, which combines insights, scientific data, predictive algorithms, and data visualization tools to develop customized products to meet specific customer requirements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we executed a commercialization agreement with S&W Seed Company, a global agricultural company headquartered in Longmont, Colorado, for the exclusive license of an improved quality alfalfa seed in the United States and several geographies outside the United States excluding the European Union, United Kingdom, Ukraine, Russia, and India. The new alfalfa seed will be sold as part of the S&W seed portfolio and branded IQA.

As of December 31, 2020, Cellectis owned 64.7 percent of our issued and outstanding common stock.\nOur historical financial information reflects expense allocations for certain support functions that were provided on a centralized basis pursuant to a management services agreement. As a result, such historical financial information may not reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows we would have achieved as a stand-alone company and not a subsidiary of Cellectis during such historical periods. Effective with the end of the third quarter of 2019 we have internalized nearly all the services Cellectis previously provided. Cellectis has also guaranteed the lease of our headquarters facility.\nCellectis has certain contractual rights as well as rights pursuant to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, in each case, provided it maintains threshold beneficial ownership levels in our shares.\nWe hold an exclusive license from Cellectis that broadly covers the use of engineered nucleases for plant gene editing. This intellectual property covers methods to edit plant genes using chimeric restriction endonucleases,\u201d which include TALEN, CRISPR/Cas9, zinc finger nucleases, and some types of meganucleases.\nFINANCIAL OPERATIONS OVERVIEW\nRevenue\nRevenues are recognized as described in our Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized revenue from the sales of high oleic soybean grain, oil, and meal as well as sales of our first hemp product. Historically, we have not recognized revenue from seed transactions because of the grower's commitment to sell their crop to us. We benefit from the cash upon payment and defer the net profit on the seed to inventory and recognize that benefit when the grower delivers grain to us. Beginning in 2021, we expect seed sales to result in revenue because we will not be buying back grain from growers.\nCost of Goods Sold and Inventory\nPrior to 2019, our cost of goods sold represented immaterial costs associated with our out-licensing activities. Costs we incurred associated with the purchasing, storing, transporting, and processing grain and seed, net of proceeds of seed sales (Grain Costs), were expensed as R&D. Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, we began to capitalize all Grain Costs into inventory. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred $3.3 million of Grain Costs that were expensed as R&D. These amounts affect the year-over-year comparability of costs of goods sold, gross margins, and R&D expenses.\nCost of goods sold also includes crush and refining losses that are expensed as incurred since they do not add to the value of the finished products. All other grain and risk management costs, net of the benefit from our seed activity, are capitalized to inventory and relieved to cost of goods sold as the high oleic soybean grain, oil and meal is sold. Cost of goods sold also includes any gains and losses on commodity derivative contracts to hedge fixed price grain inventories and Forward Purchase Contracts. Any valuation adjustments to inventory are recognized as incurred.\nResearch and Development Expense\nR&D expenses consist of the costs of performing activities to discover and develop products and advance our intellectual property. We recognize R&D expenses as they are incurred. Prior to commercialization of our high oleic soybean products in early 2019, we also reported Grain Costs as R&D expenses.\nExcluding the Grain Costs mentioned above, our R&D expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for personnel who research and develop our product candidates, fees for contractors who support product development and breeding activities, expenses for trait validation, purchasing material and supplies for our laboratories, licensing, an allocation of facility and information technology expenses, and other costs associated with owning and operating our own laboratories. R&D expenses also include costs to write and support the research for filing patents.\nOur R&D efforts are central to our business and account for a significant portion of our operating expenses, and as a result, we expect mid-single digit growth in these cash expenses over time.\nSelling and Supply Chain Expense\nSelling and Supply Chain (S&SC) expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for selling our products, acreage acquisition, managing the supply chain, and business development, as well as costs to market our products and an allocation of facility and information technology expenses. In 2020, we made significant staffing adjustments as part of the change in our soybean go-to-market strategy, including adjustments related to soybean processing and product sales.\nFollowing these adjustments, we expect our S&SC expenses will decrease significantly from 2020 to 2021, and then expect low-single digit growth in these cash expenses over time.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for our executive, legal, intellectual property, information technology, finance, and human resources functions. Other G&A expenses include facility and information technology expenses not otherwise allocated to R&D or S&SC expenses, professional fees for auditing, tax and legal services, expenses associated with maintaining patents, consulting costs and other costs of our information systems.\nWe expect low-single digit growth in these cash expenses over time as we believe we have the necessary foundation to grow and scale up our business.\nInterest, net\nInterest, net is comprised of interest income resulting from investments of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, unrealized gains and losses on short-term investments, and interest expense on our financing lease obligations. It is also driven by balances, yields, and timing of financing and other capital raising activities.\nNon-operating expenses\nNon-operating expenses are expenses that are not directly related to our ongoing operations and are primarily comprised of gains and losses from foreign exchange-related transactions and disposals of land, buildings, and equipment.\nAnticipated Changes Between Revenues and Costs\nAs we execute upon our streamlined business model with differentiated go-to-market strategies, we expect the composition of our revenues and costs to evolve. Future cash and revenue-generating opportunities are expected to primarily arise from seed sales, trait development and licensing activities, and licensing arrangements. Under trait development and licensing activities, revenues are expected to arise from up-front, annual or milestone, and royalty payments upon the licensees' commercial sale of products. Under licensing arrangements, revenues are expected to arise from up-front, annual and royalty payments upon the licensees' commercial sale of products.\nBecause our strategy is based on focusing on our core strengths in research and development, gene editing, and trait development, we expect R&D expenses to be the primary area of increase in our expenses. At the same time, because our streamlined business model relies on third parties assuming responsibility for agronomy infrastructure, product management, and commercialization, we expect that S&SC expense will decline as the new models are fully implemented.\nRecent Developments - COVID-19 Update\nAs previously reported, our operations in Minnesota are classified as critical sector work under the State of Minnesota's COVID-19 executive orders. Accordingly, most of our laboratory workers have continued to work onsite at our headquarters throughout the pandemic, and our R&D programs and seed distribution activities have not experienced material delays. In accordance with our COVID-19 Preparedness Plan, Minnesota executive order requirements, and CDC guidelines, we have implemented health and safety measures for the protection of our onsite workers, have maintained remote work arrangements for our non-laboratory personnel and have implemented, as necessary, appropriate self-quarantine precautions for potentially affected laboratory personnel.\nDuring 2020, supply chain disruptions did not have a material impact on our operations. however, a resurgence or prolonging of the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental response measures, and resulting disruptions could rapidly offset such improvements. Moreover, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial markets remain substantial and broader economic uncertainties persist, which may make obtaining capital challenging and have exacerbated the risk that such capital, if available, may not be available on terms acceptable to us. There continues to be significant uncertainty relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact, and many factors could affect our results and operations, including, but not limited to, those discussed under the caption Risk Factors\u201d in the reports we file with the SEC.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019\nDuring 2020 we purchased soybeans and then either further processed them and sold the resulting oil and meal or, following our announcement in August 2020 to move our soybean go-to-market strategy to seed sales, sold grain outright. As of the end of the year we had sold all our 2019 grain and nearly all of the grain delivered to us at harvest in 2020. As of December 31, 2020, our receivables were from two of the world's largest soybean processors and nearly all were collected shortly after year-end. We have sold all our soybean meal and oil and have exited nearly all of our soybean transportation and processing agreements. We will purchase the remainder of the 2020 harvest between January 1, 2021 and August 31, 2021. As we announced in December 2020, ADM has committed to purchase over four million bushels of our grain, which includes all the 2020 crop. We expect to sell that grain throughout 2021. We expect to sell the remaining grain to ADM at market prices, and as a result, we will continue to hedge our fixed price grain inventories and fixed price Forward Purchase Contracts to mitigate the risk changing market prices may have on our margins. In the fourth quarter of 2020, our gross margins and adjusted gross margins (a non-GAAP measure) were negative 47 percent and negative 30 percent, respectively, which reflects our current business strategy and go-to-market strategies.\nThe following discussion of results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 should be read together with -Financial Operations Overview-Anticipated Changes between Revenues and Costs.\u201d\nA summary of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 follows:\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands, except percentage values)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 226.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 278.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,276\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,984\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,292\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 468.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,131\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling and supply chain expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (792\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,809\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Management fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,086\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (81.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (878\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (988\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (898.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (126\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (77\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 157.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (44,836\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (39,612\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5,224\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic and diluted net loss per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1.32\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1.21\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.11\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (31,641\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (29,792\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,849\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 See Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net loss, the most comparable GAAP measure.\nRevenue\nRevenue was $23.9 million in 2020, an increase of $16.6 million, or 227 percent, from 2019, driven by the sale of a substantial portion of the 2020 grain crop and the completion of the sale of all soybean oil and meal during 2020. The sales of grain were $13.0 million and included all remaining 2019 grain and seed and represent approximately 40 percent of the 2020 grain crop.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold were $35.1 million in 2020, an increase of $25.8 million from 2019, driven by the higher volume of product sold, higher average prices paid for grain as a result of increases in commodity market prices for soybeans and lower costs associated with products sold in 2019 because $3.3 million of Grain Costs were previously expensed as R&D, $2.8 million of unrealized commodity derivative losses from hedging contracts sold to convert our fixed price grain inventory and fixed price Forward Purchase Contracts to floating prices to link them to market, consistent with how we expect to sell the grain, and a $1.3 million increase in net realizable value adjustments to period-end inventories including write-downs of excess seed produced for 2020 plantings. These increases were partially offset by the benefits resulting from the advancement of our soybean product line go-to-market strategy.\nGross Margin\nGross margin was a negative $11.3 million, or negative 47 percent, in 2020, a decrease of $9.3 million or 2,008 basis points from 2019, driven by the higher volume of product sold, the impact of lower costs associated with products sold in 2019 because $3.3 million of Grain Costs were previously expensed as R&D, $2.8 million of unrealized commodity derivative losses from futures contracts sold to hedge our fixed price grain inventory and fixed price Forward Purchase Contracts, and a $1.3 million increase in our net realizable value adjustment to period-end inventories including write-downs of excess seed produced for 2020 plantings. These increases were partially offset by higher selling prices and benefits from the advancement of our soybean product line go-to-market strategy.\nAdjusted gross margin, a non-GAAP measure, was a negative $7.2 million, or negative 30 percent, in 2020, compared to negative $4.5 million, or negative 61 percent, in 2019. The improvement on a percentage basis was driven by savings from the advancement of our soybean product line go-to-market strategy.\nSee below under the heading Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for a discussion of adjusted gross margin and a reconciliation of gross margin, the most comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted gross margin.\nResearch and Development Expense\nR&D expenses were $11.1 million in 2020, a decrease of $1.1 million from 2019, driven by lower non-cash stock compensation expense of $1.1 million primarily from a recapture of non-cash stock compensation expense from the forfeiture and modification of unvested stock awards and lower stock award values. The same period in 2019 also included $0.4 million of expense to write off research and development tax credits that were no longer realizable.\nSelling and Supply Chain Expense\nS&SC expenses were $4.4 million in 2020, a decrease of $0.8 million from 2019, driven by a decrease in non-cash stock compensation expense of $1.0 million primarily from a recapture of non-cash stock compensation expense from the forfeiture of unvested stock awards, lower stock award values, and lower marketing and travel expenses, partially offset by additional personnel costs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nG&A expenses were $16.2 million, a decrease of $2.8 million from 2019, driven by a decrease in non-cash stock compensation of $1.4 million as a result of fewer stock awards issued and lower stock award values, and lower personnel costs of $1.4 million, partially offset by an increase in insurance costs.\nManagement Fees\nManagement fees were $0.3 million in 2020, a decrease of $1.1 million from 2019, as we previously internalized certain services provided by Cellectis, including investor relations, information technology, human resources, legal, and communications.\nRestructuring Costs\nRestructuring costs were $0.7 million in 2020 and reflect the impact of severance and other expenses resulting from the action we initiated in August 2020 to advance our soybean product line go-to-market strategy. There were no restructuring costs in 2019.\nInterest, net\nInterest, net was $0.9 million expense, a decrease of $1.0 million from 2019, driven by lower yields and lower cash balances.\nNet Loss\nNet loss was $44.8 million in 2020, an increase of $5.2 million from 2019, driven by a $9.3 million decrease in gross margin following the launch of our high oleic soybean products and the higher costs we experienced during the product's proof of concept period, a $1.1 million decrease in management fees, a $1.0 decrease in interest, net, and $0.7 million of restructuring costs, partially offset by $4.2 million of lower non-cash stock compensation expenses as a result of a recapture of non-cash stock compensation expense from the forfeiture and modification of unvested stock awards, as well as the impact from fewer stock awards issued and lower stock award values, and a $0.6 million decrease in Section 16 officer transition expenses. The same period in 2019 also included $0.4 million of expense to write off R&D tax credits that were no longer realizable.\nAdjusted net loss, a non-GAAP measure, was $40.3 million in 2020, a decrease of $0.1 million from 2019.\nSee below under the heading Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for a discussion of adjusted net loss and a reconciliation of net loss, the most comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted net loss.\nNet Loss Per Share\nNet loss per share was $1.32 in 2020, an increase of $0.11 per share from 2019, driven by the change in net loss.\nAdjusted net loss per share, a non-GAAP measure, was $1.19 in 2020, an improvement of $0.04 per share from 2019, driven by the change in adjusted net loss.\nSee below under the heading Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d

2018, entirely from increased sales volumes of our high oleic soybean oil and soybean meal following the commercialization of these products in early 2019. During 2019, we generated $1.7 million of high oleic soybean oil revenue. We sold all our high oleic soybean meal production in the year, totaling $5.6 million in revenue.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold was $9.3 million in 2019, an increase of $9.3 million from 2018, reflecting the cost of product sold in the period, and a $0.9 million valuation reserve against our inventories.\nGross Margin\nGross margin was negative $2.0 million or negative 27 percent in 2019, a decrease of $2.2 million from 2018, reflecting the higher costs we have experienced at this early stage of commercialization of our high oleic soybean products.\nAdjusted gross margin, a non-GAAP measure, was negative $4.5 million, or negative 61 percent, compared to negative $2.0 million, or negative 100 percent, in 2018. This was driven by the impact of lower costs associated with products sold in 2019 because $3.3 million of Grain Costs were previously expensed in R&D.\nSee below under the heading Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for a discussion of adjusted gross margin and a reconciliation of gross margin, the most comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted gross margin.\nResearch and Development Expense\nR&D expenses were $12.2 million in 2019, an increase of $1.9 million from 2018, driven by $1.6 million of higher non-cash stock compensation expenses, $1.4 million of additional personnel costs, $0.7 million of incremental lab supplies and outsourcing costs and $0.6 million from the reversal of payroll tax benefits that are no longer realizable. These increases were partially offset by a $3.3 million decrease in Grain Costs expensed as R&D in 2018.\nSelling and Supply Chain Expense\nS&SC expenses were $5.2 million in 2019, an increase of $2.8 million from 2018, driven by $1.2 million of additional personnel costs, $0.9 million incremental allocated expenses for facilities and information technology expenses, and $0.4 million of higher non-cash stock compensation expenses, all the result of our commercialization and acreage expansion in 2019.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nG&A expenses were $19.0 million in 2019, an increase of $5.6 million from 2018, driven by $2.9 million of higher non-cash stock compensation expenses, $2.6 million of additional personnel costs, and $1.0 million of incremental professional services expenses. The increases in personnel costs and professional services expenses are partially offset by the benefit of internalizing certain services previously provided by Cellectis which resulted in lower management fees.\nManagement Fees\nManagement fees were $1.3 million in 2019, a decline of $0.9 million from 2018, as we internalized certain services previously provided by Cellectis including investor relations, information technology, human resources, legal, and communications.\nInterest, net\nInterest, net was $0.1 million in 2019, a decrease of $0.2 million from 2018, driven by lower yields on investments, less cash to invest, and higher financing lease obligation balances.\nNet Loss\nNet loss was $39.6 million in 2019, an increase of $11.7 million from 2018, driven by $5.2 million of additional personnel costs, $4.9 million of higher non-cash stock compensation expenses and a $2.2 million negative change in gross margins following the launch of our soybean products, reflecting the early stage of commercialization of our business and the impact of lower costs associated with products sold in 2019 because $3.3 million of Grain Costs were previously expensed as R&D.\nAdjusted net loss, a non-GAAP measure, was $40.5 million in 2019, a decrease of $16.5 million from 2018.\nSee below under the heading Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for a discussion of adjusted net loss and a reconciliation of net loss, the most comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted net loss.\nNet Loss Per Share\nNet loss per share was $1.21 in 2019, an increase of $0.30 per share from 2018, driven by the change in net loss.\nAdjusted net loss per share, a non-GAAP measure, was $1.23 in 2019, a decrease of $0.45 per share from 2018, driven by the change in adjusted net loss.\nSee below under the heading Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for a discussion of adjusted net loss per share and a reconciliation of net loss per share, the most comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted net loss per share.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was $29.8 million in 2019, a decrease of $11.0 million from 2018, driven by the changes in R&D, S&SC and G&A expenses, and the increases in negative gross margins described above.\nSee below under the heading Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for a discussion of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net loss, the most comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted EBIDA.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity\nOur primary liquidity source is our cash and cash equivalents, with additional liquidity accessible, subject to market conditions and other factors, from the capital markets.\nOn July 25, 2017, we completed our IPO of common stock. In the aggregate, we received net proceeds from the IPO of $58.0 million.\nOn May 22, 2018, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock. In the aggregate, we received net proceeds from the follow-on offering of $57.0 million.\nOn October 20, 2020, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock. In the aggregate, we received net proceeds from the follow-on offering of $14.0 million.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments of $30.0 million. All these amounts are convertible to cash within 90 days except for $1.0 million of restricted cash associated with our financing leases. Current liabilities were $7.0 million at December 31, 2020. Accordingly, we have cash and cash equivalents sufficient to fund all short-term obligations as of that date.\nOur liquidity funds our non-discretionary cash requirements and our discretionary spending. Working capital is our principal non-discretionary funding requirement. In addition, we have contractual obligations related to our recurring business operations, primarily related to lease obligations. Our principal discretionary cash spending includes capital expenditures.\nGene editing is a highly regulated activity, and we incur significant expense related to our monitoring of, and compliance with, applicable regulatory requirements in the United States. To the extent that we opportunistically pursue business arrangements that bring innovations developed for North America to new territories, we would be required to incur significant additional regulatory costs in order to comply with applicable regulatory requirements outside the United States.\nWe incurred losses from operations of $44.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, $39.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and $27.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $166.9 million and expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> In Thousands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (44,836\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (39,612\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (27,897\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in operating assets and liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,708\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,551\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,570\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (43,672\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (31,951\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (20,202\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash used by operating activities increased by $11.7 million in 2020, driven by the increase in our net loss of $5.2 million, lower non-cash stock compensation expenses of $4.2 million from the recapture of non-cash compensation expense from the forfeiture and modification of unvested stock awards which meant more of our net loss was driven by cash items, lower stock award values, and fewer stock awards granted, and an increase in cash flows used by operating assets and liabilities of $4.2 million, primarily from activity related to our soybean product line.\nNet cash used by operating activities increased by $11.7 million in 2019 driven by the increase in our net loss of $11.7 million and a net decrease in cash flows provided by operating assets and liabilities of $5.4 million, primarily from higher inventories and accounts receivable following the commercialization of our high oleic soybean products earlier in 2019, and $1.6 million of cash payments made in 2019 to suppliers for services provided to us in 2018. These uses of cash were partially offset by additional non-cash stock compensation expenses of $4.6 million.\nWe expect cash used by operating activities in 2021 to be lower than 2020 driven by a decrease in net loss and a reduction in net working capital in our soybean product line as a result of the advancement of our go-to-market strategy to a seed sale approach.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> In Thousands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchases of land, buildings, and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,786\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,969\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,847\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchases of short-term investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,698\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (13,484\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,969\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,847\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash used by investing activities increased by $10.5 million in 2020, driven by our purchases of short-term investments as part of our credit risk diversification strategy.\nNet cash used by investing activities increased by $1.1 million in 2019, driven by purchases of laboratory equipment following the build out of our new headquarters facility that was completed in 2018 as well as for equipment to support the expansion of our R&D pipeline.\nWe expect net cash used for purchases of land, buildings, and equipment in 2021 to be comparable to 2020, and cash used for purchases of short-term investments to decrease in 2021 as we continue to use cash to fund operations.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> In Thousands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from common stock issuance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs incurred related to the issuance of stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (963\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (665\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from Payroll Protection Program loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repayments of financing lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (360\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (275\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from the exercise of stock options\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs incurred related to shares withheld for net settlement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (813\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (230\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from sale and leaseback of land, buildings, and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided (used) by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (330\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided (used) by financing activities increased by $15.7 million, driven by $14.0 million of net proceeds from our follow-on common stock offering and $1.5 million of Paycheck Protection Program loan proceeds.\nNet cash provided (used) by financing activities decreased by $61.0 million in 2019 reflecting the net proceeds from our follow-on offering of common stock in 2018, as well as lower proceeds from stock option exercises of $2.3 million. We also had $0.8 million less proceeds from the sale and leaseback of equipment, and we also made $0.6 million more payments to satisfy statutory income tax withholding requirements relating to the net share settlement upon the vesting of restricted stock units in 2019.\nWe expect net cash provided by financing activities in 2021 to be similar to 2020, excluding the impact of the 2020 capital raise. To fund our longer-term capital and liquidity needs, we expect we will need to secure additional capital in addition to potential revenue generation as we execute upon our go-to-market strategies.\nCapital Resources\nOperating Capital Requirements\nConsidering factors such as cash raised in October 2020, our anticipated cash burn rate, our anticipated expense reduction efforts, our expectations regarding an effective advancement of our go-to-market soybean strategy, and anticipated cash receipts from our product development and technology licensing efforts with partners, we believe our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash as of December 31, 2020, will be enough to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months and into the second half of 2022.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to generate losses for the next several years before revenue is enough to support our operating capital requirements. Until we can generate substantial cash flow, we expect to finance a portion of future cash needs through cash on hand, public or private equity or debt financings, government or other third-party funding, and commercialization activities, which may result in various types of revenue streams from seed sales and future development agreements, trait licenses, and technology licensees, including upfront and milestone payments, annual license fees, and royalties. However, additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in enough amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of our activities. Failure to receive additional funding could cause us to cease operations, in part or in full. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities, it could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and increased fixed payment obligations, and these securities may have rights senior to those of our shares of common stock. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition, and prospects.\nOur financing needs are subject to change depending on, among other things, the success of our product development efforts, the effective execution of our streamlined business model, our revenue, and our efforts to effectively manage expenses. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial markets and broader economic uncertainties may make obtaining capital through equity or debt financings more challenging and have exacerbated the risk that such capital, if available, may not be available on terms acceptable to us.\nIn response to current economic conditions, we have postponed non-essential capital expenditures and undertaken other efficiency efforts. In addition, the headcount reductions undertaken in connection with our business model advancement will contribute to our cost-saving initiatives. We will continue to review our operating expenses and to take actions that support efficient operations, financial flexibility, and optimized liquidity.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nAt December 31, 2020, we have the following contractual obligations:\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> liability for minimum lease payments for financing leases due within the next five years in an aggregate amount of $8.0 million, of which $1.8 million is payable in 2021;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> liability for minimum lease payments for operating leases due within the next five years in an aggregate amount of $0.1 million, of which an immaterial amount is payable in 2021;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Forward Purchase Contracts requiring us to make payments over the next five years in an aggregate amount of $21.2 million, of which all is payable in 2021.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn February 19, 2021 Yves Ribeill, Ph.D., Chair of the Board of Directors of Calyxt, Inc., was appointed as the Executive Chair of the Board of Directors and in that capacity, will serve as Calyxt's principal executive officer until the appointment of a successor to James Blome, our former Chief Executive Officer. Pursuant to his employment contract, Mr. Blome is entitled to compensation and benefits as part of this termination without cause, and in the first quarter of 2021 we expect to record up to $2.3 million of cash expense for separation-related payments. The cash payments to Mr. Blome will be made over a period of 24 months from the date his separation agreement is executed, which has not occurred as of the date of this Annual Report, but is expect on or before March 12, 2021.\nForward Purchase Contracts\nWe enter into seed and grain production agreements (Forward Purchase Contracts) with seed producers and growers.\nThe seed contracts often require us to pay prices for the seed produced at commodity futures market prices plus a premium. The seed growers have the option to fix their price with us throughout the term of the agreement. We pay a portion of the seed cost in December each year and the remainder upon delivery in either the first or second quarter of the following year.\nThe grain grower contracts require us to pay prices for all grain produced at commodity futures market prices plus a premium. The grain growers have the option to fix their price with us throughout the term of the agreement. The grain grower contracts allow for delivery of grain to us at harvest if so specified when the agreement is executed, otherwise delivery occurs on a date that we elect through August 31 of the following year. We pay for grain within a contractually determined number of days following delivery and final pricing.\nIn all periods prior to January 1, 2019, we considered Forward Purchase Contracts to be derivatives and recorded the contracts at fair market value with changes in value reflected in earnings as R&D expense. Effective January 1, 2019, we designated all Forward Purchase Contracts as normal purchases and as a result no longer consider these agreements to be derivatives. As of that date, any mark-to-market gains or losses associated with those contracts were fixed and were reflected in inventory upon our purchase of the underlying grain.\nSale-Leaseback of Headquarters and Lab Facility\nIn September 2017 we consummated a sale-leaseback transaction with a third party for our corporate headquarters and lab facility.\nOur headquarters facility is comprised of a 40,000 square-foot office and lab building, greenhouses, and outdoor research plots. We are deemed the owner for accounting purposes. The lease has a term of twenty years with four options to extend its term for five years each subject to there being no default under the lease terms beyond any cure period and us occupying the property at the time of extension. In 2017 we received $7.0 million in connection with the sale of the land and uncompleted facility.\nThe lease commenced in May 2018. Under the lease, we pay an annual base rent of eight percent of the total project cost with scheduled increases in rent of 7.5 percent on the sixth, eleventh and sixteenth anniversaries of the start of the lease commencement as well as on the first day of each renewal term. Currently, we pay an annual base rent of $1.4 million.\nWe are also responsible for all operating costs and expenses associated with the property. If the landlord decides to sell the property, we have a right of first refusal to purchase the property on the same terms offered to any third party.\nConcurrent with entering the lease, Cellectis guaranteed all our obligations under the lease agreement. Cellectis' guarantee of our obligations will terminate at the end of the second consecutive calendar year in which our tangible net worth exceeds $300 million, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. At a point when Cellectis owns 50 percent or less of our outstanding common stock, we have agreed to indemnify Cellectis for any obligations incurred by Cellectis under its guaranty of our obligations under the lease.\nSale-Leaseback of Equipment\nWe also have an equipment financing arrangement that is considered a financing lease. This arrangement has a term of four years for each draw. We were required to deposit cash into a restricted account in an amount equal to the future rent payments required by the lease. As of December 31, 2020, this restricted cash totaled $1.0 million. We have the option to request the return of excess collateral annually in December.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following policies to be the most critical to understanding our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe valuation of stock options is a critical accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We estimate the fair value of each option on the grant date, or other measurement dates if applicable, using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires us to make predictive assumptions regarding employee exercise behavior, future stock price volatility, and dividend yield.\nThe estimated fair values of stock options granted, and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows:\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.0 - 10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.8 - 10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.6 - 10\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77.4% - 81.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52.6% - 78.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.9% - 57.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> .3% - 1.7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.7% - 2.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.2% - 3.0%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur expected term represents the period that options granted are expected to be outstanding determined using the simplified method. An increase in the expected term by one year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would increase the grant date fair value by five percent. We estimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility of comparable public companies over the expected term of the option. A one percentage point increase in our volatility assumption, leaving all other assumptions constant, would increase the grant date fair value by one percent. We estimate the risk-free interest rate based on the United States Treasury zero-coupon yield curve at the date of grant for the expected term of the option. A one percentage point increase in the risk-free interest rate, leaving all other assumptions constant, would not change the grant date fair value. We do not nor do we expect to pay dividends.\nTo the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based expense to final intrinsic values. Historical data has a significant bearing on our forward-looking assumptions. Significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then significantly impact the year-over-year comparability of stock-based compensation expense.\nNet Realizable Value of Inventories\nThe determination of the net realizable value of our inventories is a critical accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, especially at the early stage of commercialization for our soybean products. At each period-end, we make assumptions regarding projected selling prices for our products considering futures market prices for the underlying agricultural markets and our associated risk management strategies, our anticipated costs, and other factors that take into consideration our limited operating history and compare those prices to the current weighted average costs of our inventories. If our costs are higher than the projected selling prices, then a valuation adjustment is recorded. Changes in our projected selling prices and cost structure will affect the amount of these adjustments over time.\nIncome Tax Valuation Allowances\nThe determination of the income tax valuation allowances requires us to use judgments and assumptions that may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, especially at the early stage of commercialization. We provide deferred taxes for deductible and taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Because we generate losses currently and have reflected a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. If we were to generate profits, the valuation allowance may change.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting requirements for accounting, presentation, and classification of leases. This will result in most leases being capitalized as a right of use asset with a related liability on our balance sheets. Because we are an emerging growth company, the requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those annual periods. We are in the process of analyzing the impact of this standard on our results of operations and financial position.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting requirements on how to account for credit losses on most financial assets and certain other instruments. This will require the estimation of lifetime expected credit losses and corresponding recognition of allowance for losses on trade and other receivables, loans, and other instruments held at amortized cost. The ASU requires certain recurring disclosures and is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning on or after December 15, 2023. We are in the process of analyzing the impact of this standard on our results of operations.\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nTo supplement our audited financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, we have prepared certain non-GAAP measures that include or exclude special items. These non-GAAP measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and should be viewed as supplemental and in addition to our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, other companies may report similarly titled measures, but calculate them differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Management utilizes these non-GAAP metrics as performance measures in evaluating and making operational decisions regarding our business.\nWe present adjusted gross margin, a non-GAAP measure that includes the effects of Grain Costs expensed as R&D in a prior period, excludes the effects of commodity derivatives entered into to hedge the change in value of fixed price grain inventories and fixed price Forward Purchase Contracts as the expected impact from these contracts will be fully offset when the underlying grain is sold, and excludes the impact of any net realizable value adjustments to inventories occurring in the period, which would otherwise have been recorded as an adjustment to value in a prior period or would have been recorded in a future period as the underlying products are sold.\nWe provide in the table below a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin to gross margin, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We provide adjusted gross margin because we believe that this non-GAAP financial metric provides investors with useful supplemental information at this stage of commercialization as the amounts being adjusted affect the period-to-period comparability of our gross margins and financial performance.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of gross margin to adjusted gross margin:\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> In Thousands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin (GAAP measure)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (11,276\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,984\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (47\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (27\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Grain Costs expensed as R&D\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,349\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized mark-to-market loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realizable value adjustment to inventories\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7,153\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,464\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted gross margin percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (30\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (61\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe present adjusted net loss, a non-GAAP measure, and define it as net loss including the effects of Grain Costs expensed as R&D in a prior period, and excluding the effects of commodity derivatives entered into to hedge the change in value of fixed price grain inventories and fixed price Forward Purchase Contracts as the expected impact from these contracts will be fully offset when the underlying grain is sold, any net realizable value adjustments to inventories occurring in the period, which would otherwise have been recorded as an adjustment to value in a prior period or would have been recorded in a future period as the underlying products are sold, Section 16 officer transition expenses, R&D payroll tax credits that are no longer realizable, restructuring costs, the recapture of non-cash stock compensation expense from the forfeiture and modification of unvested stock awards associated with staffing adjustments made as part of the advancement of our soybean business model, and non-operating expenses, which are primarily gains and losses on foreign exchange transactions and losses on the disposals of land, building, and equipment.\nWe provide in the table below a reconciliation of adjusted net loss to net loss, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

During 2019, we generated $1.7 million of high oleic soybean oil revenue. We sold all our high oleic soybean meal production in the year, totaling $5.6 million in revenue.\nWe provide in the table below a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin to gross margin, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We provide adjusted gross margin because we believe that this non-GAAP financial metric provides investors with useful supplemental information at this stage of commercialization as the amounts being adjusted affect the period-to-period comparability of our gross margins and financial performance.\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nWe provide in the table below a reconciliation of adjusted net loss to net loss, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We provide adjusted net loss because we believe that this non-GAAP financial metric provides investors with useful supplemental information at this stage of commercialization as the amounts being adjusted affect the period-to-period comparability of our net losses and financial performance.\n\nWe expect net cash provided by financing activities in 2021 to be similar to 2020, excluding the impact of the 2020 capital raise. To fund our longer-term capital and liquidity needs, we expect we will need to secure additional capital in addition to potential revenue generation as we execute upon our go-to-market strategies.\nBecause our strategy is based on focusing on our core strengths in research and development, gene editing, and trait development, we expect R&D expenses to be the primary area of increase in our expenses. At the same time, because our streamlined business model relies on third parties assuming responsibility for agronomy infrastructure, product management, and commercialization, we expect that S&SC expense will decline as the new models are fully implemented.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nSee below under the heading Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for a discussion of adjusted net loss per share and a reconciliation of net loss per share, the most comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted net loss per share.\n \u2022 During the first quarter of 2020, we were notified that a significant portion of our high fiber wheat plants were damaged in field trials due to improper aerial chemical applications by unaffiliated third parties. While we are continuing to assess the impact of this damage on the overall development process and timeline for this product candidate, it has delayed development by at least one year. This product candidate is currently in Phase 3 of our development pipeline. Our Phase 3 development activities in 2021 will include testing the product concept in field conditions, completing food application studies, and voluntarily consulting with FDA. Given the damage to our field trials described above, the timeline for the trait to be available \nAs we execute upon our streamlined business model with differentiated go-to-market strategies, we expect the composition of our revenues and costs to evolve. Future cash and revenue-generating opportunities are expected to primarily arise from seed sales, trait development and licensing activities, and licensing arrangements. Under trait development and licensing activities, revenues are expected to arise from up-front, annual or milestone, and royalty payments upon the licensees' commercial sale of products. Under licensing arrangements, revenues are expected to arise from up-front, annual and royalty payments upon the licensees' commercial sale of products.\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for our executive, legal, intellectual property, information technology, finance, and human resources functions. Other G&A expenses include facility and information technology expenses not otherwise allocated to R&D or S&SC expenses, professional fees for auditing, tax and legal services, expenses associated with maintaining patents, consulting costs and other costs of our information systems.\nRecent Developments - COVID-19 Update\n \u2022 acquiring or in-licensing other products, technologies, germplasm, or other biological material; \nNet loss per share was $1.21 in 2019, an increase of $0.30 per share from 2018, driven by the change in net loss.\nAdjusted net loss, a non-GAAP measure, was $40.5 million in 2019, a decrease of $16.5 million from 2018.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the next several years. Those expenses and losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. We expect that our expenses will be driven by:\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nG&A expenses were $16.2 million, a decrease of $2.8 million from 2019, driven by a decrease in non-cash stock compensation of $1.4 million as a result of fewer stock awards issued and lower stock award values, and lower personnel costs of $1.4 million, partially offset by an increase in insurance costs.\nNet Realizable Value of Inventories\nOur historical financial information reflects expense allocations for certain support functions that were provided on a centralized basis pursuant to a management services agreement. As a result, such historical financial information may not reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows we would have achieved as a stand-alone company and not a subsidiary of Cellectis during such historical periods. Effective with the end of the third quarter of 2019 we have internalized nearly all the services Cellectis previously provided. Cellectis has also guaranteed the lease of our headquarters facility.\nIn September 2017 we consummated a sale-leaseback transaction with a third party for our corporate headquarters and lab facility.\nNet Loss Per Share\nSelected Achievements and Developments\nOur strategy is based on focusing on our core strengths in research and development, gene editing, and trait development. We deploy a capital-efficient, streamlined business model comprising three differentiated go-to-market strategies. Specific deal structure and the amount and timing of cash flows and revenues are expected to vary depending upon several factors, including cost to develop, size of the opportunity, and the stage at which a partner or licensee enters the development process. Across each of our go-to-market strategies, we seek to develop relationships with strategic customers where our product candidates are most likely to benefit from the counterparty's deep agronomy, product management, and commercialization expertise.\nAdjusted gross margin, a non-GAAP measure, was a negative $7.2 million, or negative 30 percent, in 2020, compared to negative $4.5 million, or negative 61 percent, in 2019.

We are a leader in gene editing with exclusive access to proprietary TALEN technology for use in plants, which we used to successfully commercialize the first gene edited food product in the United States. We have a robust development pipeline that spans multiple crops and that is focused on several important trends, including functional nutrition, regenerative agriculture, sustainability, plant-based protein, and animal nutrition.\nIncome Tax Valuation Allowances\nInterest, net\n1 See Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net loss, the most comparable GAAP measure.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments of $30.0 million. All these amounts are convertible to cash within 90 days except for $1.0 million of restricted cash associated with our financing leases. Current liabilities were $7.0 million at December 31, 2020. Accordingly, we have cash and cash equivalents sufficient to fund all short-term obligations as of that date.\nOn May 22, 2018, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock. In the aggregate, we received net proceeds from the follow-on offering of $57.0 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was $29.8 million in 2019, a decrease of $11.0 million from 2018, driven by the changes in R&D, S&SC and G&A expenses, and the increases in negative gross margins described above.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of gross margin to adjusted gross margin:\nManagement fees were $0.3 million in 2020, a decrease of $1.1 million from 2019, as we previously internalized certain services provided by Cellectis, including investor relations, information technology, human resources, legal, and communications.\nThe determination of the income tax valuation allowances requires us to use judgments and assumptions that may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, especially at the early stage of commercialization. We provide deferred taxes for deductible and taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Because we generate losses currently and have reflected a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. If we were to generate profits, the valuation allowance may change.\nThe following discussion of results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 should be read together with -Financial Operations Overview-Anticipated Changes between Revenues and Costs.\u201d\n \u2022 seeking to attract and retain new and existing skilled personnel; \nOn February 19, 2021 Yves Ribeill, Ph.D., Chair of the Board of Directors of Calyxt, Inc., was appointed as the Executive Chair of the Board of Directors and in that capacity, will serve as Calyxt's principal executive officer until the appointment of a successor to James Blome, our former Chief Executive Officer. Pursuant to his employment contract, Mr. Blome is entitled to compensation and benefits as part of this termination without cause, and in the first quarter of 2021 we expect to record up to $2.3 million of cash expense for separation-related payments. The cash payments to Mr. Blome will be made over a period of 24 months from the date his separation agreement is executed, which has not occurred as of the date of this Annual Report, but is expect on or before March 12, 2021.\n \u2022 liability for minimum lease payments for operating leases due within the next five years in an aggregate amount of $0.1 million, of which an immaterial amount is payable in 2021; \nSee below under the heading Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for a discussion of adjusted gross margin and a reconciliation of gross margin, the most comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted gross margin.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to generate losses for the next several years before revenue is enough to support our operating capital requirements. Until we can generate substantial cash flow, we expect to finance a portion of future cash needs through cash on hand, public or private equity or debt financings, government or other third-party funding, and commercialization activities, which may result in various types of revenue streams from seed sales and future development agreements, trait licenses, and technology licensees, including upfront and milestone payments, annual license fees, and royalties. However, additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in enough amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of our activities. Failure to receive additional funding could cause us to cease operations, in part or in full. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities, it could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and increased fixed payment obligations, and these securities may have rights senior to those of our shares of common stock. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition, and prospects.\n\nOur financing needs are subject to change depending on, among other things, the success of our product development efforts, the effective execution of our streamlined business model, our revenue, and our efforts to effectively manage expenses. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial markets and broader economic uncertainties may make obtaining capital through equity or debt financings more challenging and have exacerbated the risk that such capital, if available, may not be available on terms acceptable to us.\nConsidering factors such as cash raised in October 2020, our anticipated cash burn rate, our anticipated expense reduction efforts, our expectations regarding an effective advancement of our go-to-market soybean strategy, and anticipated cash receipts from our product development and technology licensing efforts with partners, we believe our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash as of December 31, 2020, will be enough to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months and into the second half of 2022.\nInterest, net is comprised of interest income resulting from investments of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, unrealized gains and losses on short-term investments, and interest expense on our financing lease obligations. It is also driven by balances, yields, and timing of financing and other capital raising activities.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting requirements for accounting, presentation, and classification of leases. This will result in most leases being capitalized as a right of use asset with a related liability on our balance sheets. Because we are an emerging growth company, the requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those annual periods. We are in the process of analyzing the impact of this standard on our results of operations and financial position.\nWe present adjusted gross margin, a non-GAAP measure that includes the effects of Grain Costs expensed as R&D in a prior period, excludes the effects of commodity derivatives entered into to hedge the change in value of fixed price grain inventories and fixed price Forward Purchase Contracts as the expected impact from these contracts will be fully offset when the underlying grain is sold, and excludes the impact of any net realizable value adjustments to inventories occurring in the period, which would otherwise have been recorded as an adjustment to value in a prior period or would have been recorded in a future period as the underlying products are sold.\nOur expected term represents the period that options granted are expected to be outstanding determined using the simplified method. An increase in the expected term by one year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would increase the grant date fair value by five percent. We estimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility of comparable public companies over the expected term of the option. A one percentage point increase in our volatility assumption, leaving all other assumptions constant, would increase the grant date fair value by one percent. We estimate the risk-free interest rate based on the United States Treasury zero-coupon yield curve at the date of grant for the expected term of the option. A one percentage point increase in the risk-free interest rate, leaving all other assumptions constant, would not change the grant date fair value. We do not nor do we expect to pay dividends.\nWe present adjusted net loss per share, a non-GAAP measure, and define it as net loss per share including the effects of Grain Costs expensed as R&D in a prior period, and excluding the effects of commodity derivatives entered into to hedge the change in value of fixed price grain inventories and fixed price Forward Purchase Contracts as the expected impact from these contracts will be fully offset when the underlying grain is sold, any net realizable value adjustments to inventories occurring in the period, which would otherwise have been recorded as an adjustment to value in a prior period or would have been recorded in a future period as the underlying products are sold, Section 16 officer transition expenses, R&D payroll tax credits that are no longer realizable, restructuring costs, the recapture of non-cash stock compensation expense from the forfeiture and modification of unvested stock awards associated with staffing adjustments made as part of the advancement of our soybean business model, and non-operating expenses, which are primarily gains and losses on foreign exchange transactions and losses on the disposals of land, buildings, and equipment.\nThe accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following policies to be the most critical to understanding our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nAdjusted gross margin, a non-GAAP measure, was negative $4.5 million, or negative 61 percent, compared to negative $2.0 million, or negative 100 percent, in 2018. This was driven by the impact of lower costs associated with products sold in 2019 because $3.3 million of Grain Costs were previously expensed in R&D.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe grain grower contracts require us to pay prices for all grain produced at commodity futures market prices plus a premium. The grain growers have the option to fix their price with us throughout the term of the agreement. The grain grower contracts allow for delivery of grain to us at harvest if so specified when the agreement is executed, otherwise delivery occurs on a date that we elect through August 31 of the following year. We pay for grain within a contractually determined number of days following delivery and final pricing.\n \u2022 addressing the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including implementing expense reduction efforts and seeking to bolster our liquidity position considering changing business needs and uncertain macro-economic conditions; and \nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n</td> </tr>\nWe expect low-single digit growth in these cash expenses over time as we believe we have the necessary foundation to grow and scale up our business.\nNet loss was $39.6 million in 2019, an increase of $11.7 million from 2018, driven by $5.2 million of additional personnel costs, $4.9 million of higher non-cash stock compensation expenses and a $2.2 million negative change in gross margins following the launch of our soybean products, reflecting the early stage of commercialization of our business and the impact of lower costs associated with products sold in 2019 because $3.3 million of Grain Costs were previously expensed as R&D.\nWe incurred losses from operations of $44.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, $39.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and $27.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $166.9 million and expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future.\n \u2022 continuing to advance the R&D of our current and future products; \n \u2022 Also in the second quarter of 2020, we released our non-edited hemp germplasm by selling plants directly to a grower, driving several thousand dollars of revenue. This project leveraged our plant breeding expertise to quickly purify and stabilize key varieties of a partner's germplasm. While not significant to our financial results, this successful project enabled the gathering of valuable insights and data, and it is expected to serve as the base germplasm for the development of other hemp projects expected to launch beginning in 2023. \nFollowing these adjustments, we expect our S&SC expenses will decrease significantly from 2020 to 2021, and then expect low-single digit growth in these cash expenses over time.\nOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CELLECTIS AND COMPARABILITY OF OUR RESULTS\nRevenue was $23.9 million in 2020, an increase of $16.6 million, or 227 percent, from 2019, driven by the sale of a substantial portion of the 2020 grain crop and the completion of the sale of all soybean oil and meal during 2020. The sales of grain were $13.0 million and included all remaining 2019 grain and seed and represent approximately 40 percent of the 2020 grain crop.\n \u2022 In the fourth quarter of 2020, we entered into a research collaboration with NRGene\u00ae that includes the adoption of NRGene's cloud-based genomics platform to support several of our research projects. The genomics solutions, including NRGene's QuickGENETICS\u2122 technology, which analyzes breeding populations, delivers high resolution genetic mapping, and generates unique genetic markers for high value traits, are expected to allow for more comprehensive evaluations to accelerate trait discovery and breeding across multiple crops. We are integrating NRGene's genomic resources to build out our proprietary predictive data analytics, which combines insights, scientific data, predictive algorithms, and data visualization tools to develop customized products to meet specific customer requirements. \nSee below under the heading Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for a discussion of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net loss, the most comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted EBIDA.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of net loss per share to adjusted net loss per share:\nOn October 20, 2020, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock. In the aggregate, we received net proceeds from the follow-on offering of $14.0 million.\n \u2022 liability for minimum lease payments for financing leases due within the next five years in an aggregate amount of $8.0 million, of which $1.8 million is payable in 2021; \nIn all periods prior to January 1, 2019, we considered Forward Purchase Contracts to be derivatives and recorded the contracts at fair market value with changes in value reflected in earnings as R&D expense. Effective January 1, 2019, we designated all Forward Purchase Contracts as normal purchases and as a result no longer consider these agreements to be derivatives. As of that date, any mark-to-market gains or losses associated with those contracts were fixed and were reflected in inventory upon our purchase of the underlying grain.\nWe enter into seed and grain production agreements (Forward Purchase Contracts) with seed producers and growers.\nGross margin was a negative $11.3 million, or negative 47 percent, in 2020, a decrease of $9.3 million or 2,008 basis points from 2019, driven by the higher volume of product sold, the impact of lower costs associated with products sold in 2019 because $3.3 million of Grain Costs were previously expensed as R&D, $2.8 million of unrealized commodity derivative losses from futures contracts sold to hedge our fixed price grain inventory and fixed price Forward Purchase Contracts, and a $1.3 million increase in our net realizable value adjustment to period-end inventories including write-downs of excess seed produced for 2020 plantings. These increases were partially offset by higher selling prices and benefits from the advancement of our soybean product line go-to-market strategy.\nCost of goods sold also includes crush and refining losses that are expensed as incurred since they do not add to the value of the finished products. All other grain and risk management costs, net of the benefit from our seed activity, are capitalized to inventory and relieved to cost of goods sold as the high oleic soybean grain, oil and meal is sold. Cost of goods sold also includes any gains and losses on commodity derivative contracts to hedge fixed price grain inventories and Forward Purchase Contracts. Any valuation adjustments to inventory are recognized as incurred.\nSee below under the heading Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for a discussion of adjusted net loss and a reconciliation of net loss, the most comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted net loss.\nItem 7.\nCellectis has certain contractual rights as well as rights pursuant to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, in each case, provided it maintains threshold beneficial ownership levels in our shares.\nOur headquarters facility is comprised of a 40,000 square-foot office and lab building, greenhouses, and outdoor research plots. We are deemed the owner for accounting purposes. The lease has a term of twenty years with four options to extend its term for five years each subject to there being no default under the lease terms beyond any cure period and us occupying the property at the time of extension. In 2017 we received $7.0 million in connection with the sale of the land and uncompleted facility.\nCost of Goods Sold\nLiquidity\nWe are an early-stage company and have incurred net losses since our inception. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $166.9 million. Our net losses were $44.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAdjusted net loss per share, a non-GAAP measure, was $1.19 in 2020, an improvement of $0.04 per share from 2019, driven by the change in adjusted net loss.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was a loss of $31.6 million in 2020, an increase of $1.8 million from 2019, driven by the changes in expenses.\nFINANCIAL OPERATIONS OVERVIEW\nWe hold an exclusive license from Cellectis that broadly covers the use of engineered nucleases for plant gene editing. This intellectual property covers methods to edit plant genes using chimeric restriction endonucleases,\u201d which include TALEN, CRISPR/Cas9, zinc finger nucleases, and some types of meganucleases.\nOur R&D efforts are central to our business and account for a significant portion of our operating expenses, and as a result, we expect mid-single digit growth in these cash expenses over time.\nTo supplement our audited financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, we have prepared certain non-GAAP measures that include or exclude special items. These non-GAAP measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and should be viewed as supplemental and in addition to our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, other companies may report similarly titled measures, but calculate them differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Management utilizes these non-GAAP metrics as performance measures in evaluating and making operational decisions regarding our business.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nOn July 25, 2017, we completed our IPO of common stock. In the aggregate, we received net proceeds from the IPO of $58.0 million.\n\nNet cash used by investing activities increased by $1.1 million in 2019, driven by purchases of laboratory equipment following the build out of our new headquarters facility that was completed in 2018 as well as for equipment to support the expansion of our R&D pipeline.\nS&SC expenses were $4.4 million in 2020, a decrease of $0.8 million from 2019, driven by a decrease in non-cash stock compensation expense of $1.0 million primarily from a recapture of non-cash stock compensation expense from the forfeiture of unvested stock awards, lower stock award values, and lower marketing and travel expenses, partially offset by additional personnel costs.\nAs previously reported, our operations in Minnesota are classified as critical sector work under the State of Minnesota's COVID-19 executive orders. Accordingly, most of our laboratory workers have continued to work onsite at our headquarters throughout the pandemic, and our R&D programs and seed distribution activities have not experienced material delays. In accordance with our COVID-19 Preparedness Plan, Minnesota executive order requirements, and CDC guidelines, we have implemented health and safety measures for the protection of our onsite workers, have maintained remote work arrangements for our non-laboratory personnel and have implemented, as necessary, appropriate self-quarantine precautions for potentially affected laboratory personnel.\nWe expect cash used by operating activities in 2021 to be lower than 2020 driven by a decrease in net loss and a reduction in net working capital in our soybean product line as a result of the advancement of our go-to-market strategy to a seed sale approach.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting requirements on how to account for credit losses on most financial assets and certain other instruments. This will require the estimation of lifetime expected credit losses and corresponding recognition of allowance for losses on trade and other receivables, loans, and other instruments held at amortized cost. The ASU requires certain recurring disclosures and is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning on or after December 15, 2023. We are in the process of analyzing the impact of this standard on our results of operations.\nWe provide in the table below a reconciliation of adjusted net loss per share to net loss per share, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We provide adjusted net loss per share because we believe that this non-GAAP financial metric provides investors with useful supplemental information at this stage of commercialization as the amounts being adjusted affect the period-to-period comparability of our net losses per share and financial performance.\n\nNet Loss Per Share\nResearch and Development Expense\nTo the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based expense to final intrinsic values. Historical data has a significant bearing on our forward-looking assumptions. Significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then significantly impact the year-over-year comparability of stock-based compensation expense.\nWe also have an equipment financing arrangement that is considered a financing lease. This arrangement has a term of four years for each draw. We were required to deposit cash into a restricted account in an amount equal to the future rent payments required by the lease. As of December 31, 2020, this restricted cash totaled $1.0 million. We have the option to request the return of excess collateral annually in December.\n \u2022 Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we executed a commercialization agreement with S&W Seed Company, a global agricultural company headquartered in Longmont, Colorado, for the exclusive license of an improved quality alfalfa seed in the United States and several geographies outside the United States excluding the European Union, United Kingdom, Ukraine, Russia, and India. The new alfalfa seed will be sold as part of the S&W seed portfolio and branded IQA. This marks our first commercial trait license agreement. \nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\nSee below under the heading Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for a discussion of adjusted gross margin and a reconciliation of gross margin, the most comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted gross margin.\nPrior to 2019, our cost of goods sold represented immaterial costs associated with our out-licensing activities. Costs we incurred associated with the purchasing, storing, transporting, and processing grain and seed, net of proceeds of seed sales (Grain Costs), were expensed as R&D. Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, we began to capitalize all Grain Costs into inventory. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred $3.3 million of Grain Costs that were expensed as R&D. These amounts affect the year-over-year comparability of costs of goods sold, gross margins, and R&D expenses.\nRestructuring costs were $0.7 million in 2020 and reflect the impact of severance and other expenses resulting from the action we initiated in August 2020 to advance our soybean product line go-to-market strategy. There were no restructuring costs in 2019.\nThe lease commenced in May 2018. Under the lease, we pay an annual base rent of eight percent of the total project cost with scheduled increases in rent of 7.5 percent on the sixth, eleventh and sixteenth anniversaries of the start of the lease commencement as well as on the first day of each renewal term. Currently, we pay an annual base rent of $1.4 million.\nWe present adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure and define it as net loss excluding interest, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, the effects of commodity derivatives entered into to hedge the change in value of fixed price grain inventories and fixed price Forward Purchase Contracts as the expected impact from these contracts will be fully offset when the underlying grain is sold, any net realizable value adjustments to inventories occurring in the period, which would otherwise have been recorded as an adjustment to value in a prior period or would have been recorded in a future period as the underlying products are sold, Section 16 officer transition expenses, R&D payroll tax credits that are no longer realizable, restructuring costs, and non-operating expenses, which are primarily gains and losses on foreign exchange transactions and losses on the disposals of land, buildings, and equipment; and including the effects of Grain Costs expensed as R&D in a prior period.\nNet cash provided (used) by financing activities increased by $15.7 million, driven by $14.0 million of net proceeds from our follow-on common stock offering and $1.5 million of Paycheck Protection Program loan proceeds.\nNet Loss\n</table>\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nManagement Fees\nAnticipated Changes Between Revenues and Costs\nManagement fees were $1.3 million in 2019, a decline of $0.9 million from 2018, as we internalized certain services previously provided by Cellectis including investor relations, information technology, human resources, legal, and communications.\nDuring 2020, supply chain disruptions did not have a material impact on our operations. however, a resurgence or prolonging of the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental response measures, and resulting disruptions could rapidly offset such improvements. Moreover, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial markets remain substantial and broader economic uncertainties persist, which may make obtaining capital challenging and have exacerbated the risk that such capital, if available, may not be available on terms acceptable to us. There continues to be significant uncertainty relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact, and many factors could affect our results and operations, including, but not limited to, those discussed under the caption Risk Factors\u201d in the reports we file with the SEC.\nG&A expenses were $19.0 million in 2019, an increase of $5.6 million from 2018, driven by $2.9 million of higher non-cash stock compensation expenses, $2.6 million of additional personnel costs, and $1.0 million of incremental professional services expenses. The increases in personnel costs and professional services expenses are partially offset by the benefit of internalizing certain services previously provided by Cellectis which resulted in lower management fees.\n \u2022 making royalty and other payments under any in-license agreements; \n \u2022 seeking regulatory and marketing approvals for our products; \nManagement Fees\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA\nGross margin was negative $2.0 million or negative 27 percent in 2019, a decrease of $2.2 million from 2018, reflecting the higher costs we have experienced at this early stage of commercialization of our high oleic soybean products.\nCost of Goods Sold and Inventory\nS&SC expenses were $5.2 million in 2019, an increase of $2.8 million from 2018, driven by $1.2 million of additional personnel costs, $0.9 million incremental allocated expenses for facilities and information technology expenses, and $0.4 million of higher non-cash stock compensation expenses, all the result of our commercialization and acreage expansion in 2019.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted net loss:\nGross Margin\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nSale-Leaseback of Headquarters and Lab Facility\nOur primary liquidity source is our cash and cash equivalents, with additional liquidity accessible, subject to market conditions and other factors, from the capital markets.\nNet cash used by operating activities increased by $11.7 million in 2020, driven by the increase in our net loss of $5.2 million, lower non-cash stock compensation expenses of $4.2 million from the recapture of non-cash compensation expense from the forfeiture and modification of unvested stock awards which meant more of our net loss was driven by cash items, lower stock award values, and fewer stock awards granted, and an increase in cash flows used by operating assets and liabilities of $4.2 million, primarily from activity related to our soybean product line.\n for a commercial launch is uncertain, but not expected before 2023.

To the extent that we opportunistically pursue business arrangements that bring innovations developed for North America to new territories, we would be required to incur significant additional regulatory costs in order to comply with applicable regulatory requirements outside the United States.\nDuring 2020 we purchased soybeans and then either further processed them and sold the resulting oil and meal or, following our announcement in August 2020 to move our soybean go-to-market strategy to seed sales, sold grain outright. As of the end of the year we had sold all our 2019 grain and nearly all of the grain delivered to us at harvest in 2020. As of December 31, 2020, our receivables were from two of the world's largest soybean processors and nearly all were collected shortly after year-end. We have sold all our soybean meal and oil and have exited nearly all of our soybean transportation and processing agreements. We will purchase the remainder of the 2020 harvest between January 1, 2021 and August 31, 2021. As we announced in December 2020, ADM has committed to purchase over four million bushels of our grain, which includes all the 2020 crop. We expect to sell that grain throughout 2021. We expect to sell the remaining grain to ADM at market prices, and as a result, we will continue to hedge our fixed price grain inventories and fixed price Forward Purchase Contracts to mitigate the risk changing market prices may have on our margins. In the fourth quarter of 2020, our gross margins and adjusted gross margins (a non-GAAP measure) were negative 47 percent and negative 30 percent, respectively, which reflects our current business strategy and go-to-market strategies.\n \u2022 maintaining, protecting, expanding, and defending our intellectual property portfolio; \n\nThe seed contracts often require us to pay prices for the seed produced at commodity futures market prices plus a premium. The seed growers have the option to fix their price with us throughout the term of the agreement. We pay a portion of the seed cost in December each year and the remainder upon delivery in either the first or second quarter of the following year.\n \u2022 experiencing any delays or encountering issues with any of the above, including due to COVID-19 and its impacts. \nWe provide in the table below a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Because adjusted EBITDA excludes non-cash items and discrete or infrequently occurring items, we believe that adjusted EBITDA provides investors with useful supplemental information about the operational performance of our business and facilitates comparison of our financial results between periods where certain items may vary significantly independent of our business performance.\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019\nSale-Leaseback of Equipment\n \u2022 In August 2020, as part of the broader transition of our business model, we announced a change in the go-to-market strategy for our high oleic soybean products. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we announced that we had contracted to sell all 2020 grain production of our high oleic soybean to Archer Daniels Midland (ADM). The total purchases represent approximately four million bushels of high oleic soybean grain. Sales began in the third quarter of 2020 and will continue throughout 2021, with prices to be determined on the basis of agricultural commodity market prices in effect at the time our planned deliveries of grain are agreed upon. \nSelling and Supply Chain (S&SC) expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for selling our products, acreage acquisition, managing the supply chain, and business development, as well as costs to market our products and an allocation of facility and information technology expenses. In 2020, we made significant staffing adjustments as part of the change in our soybean go-to-market strategy, including adjustments related to soybean processing and product sales.\n \u2022 Forward Purchase Contracts requiring us to make payments over the next five years in an aggregate amount of $21.2 million, of which all is payable in 2021. \nOperating Capital Requirements\nWe present adjusted net loss, a non-GAAP measure, and define it as net loss including the effects of Grain Costs expensed as R&D in a prior period, and excluding the effects of commodity derivatives entered into to hedge the change in value of fixed price grain inventories and fixed price Forward Purchase Contracts as the expected impact from these contracts will be fully offset when the underlying grain is sold, any net realizable value adjustments to inventories occurring in the period, which would otherwise have been recorded as an adjustment to value in a prior period or would have been recorded in a future period as the underlying products are sold, Section 16 officer transition expenses, R&D payroll tax credits that are no longer realizable, restructuring costs, the recapture of non-cash stock compensation expense from the forfeiture and modification of unvested stock awards associated with staffing adjustments made as part of the advancement of our soybean business model, and non-operating expenses, which are primarily gains and losses on foreign exchange transactions and losses on the disposals of land, building, and equipment.\nNon-operating expenses are expenses that are not directly related to our ongoing operations and are primarily comprised of gains and losses from foreign exchange-related transactions and disposals of land, buildings, and equipment.\nExcluding the Grain Costs mentioned above, our R&D expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for personnel who research and develop our product candidates, fees for contractors who support product development and breeding activities, expenses for trait validation, purchasing material and supplies for our laboratories, licensing, an allocation of facility and information technology expenses, and other costs associated with owning and operating our own laboratories. R&D expenses also include costs to write and support the research for filing patents.\nR&D expenses consist of the costs of performing activities to discover and develop products and advance our intellectual property. We recognize R&D expenses as they are incurred. Prior to commercialization of our high oleic soybean products in early 2019, we also reported Grain Costs as R&D expenses.\nSelling and Supply Chain Expense\nRestructuring Costs\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nForward Purchase Contracts\nWe are a majority-owned subsidiary of Cellectis. As of December 31, 2020, Cellectis owned 64.7 percent of our issued and outstanding common stock.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nR&D expenses were $11.1 million in 2020, a decrease of $1.1 million from 2019, driven by lower non-cash stock compensation expense of $1.1 million primarily from a recapture of non-cash stock compensation expense from the forfeiture and modification of unvested stock awards and lower stock award values. The same period in 2019 also included $0.4 million of expense to write off research and development tax credits that were no longer realizable.\nAdjusted net loss, a non-GAAP measure, was $40.3 million in 2020, a decrease of $0.1 million from 2019.\nNon-operating expenses\nOur business is described in greater detail in Item 1. Business-Company Overview.\u201d\nInterest, net\nNet loss per share was $1.32 in 2020, an increase of $0.11 per share from 2019, driven by the change in net loss.\nNet loss was $44.8 million in 2020, an increase of $5.2 million from 2019, driven by a $9.3 million decrease in gross margin following the launch of our high oleic soybean products and the higher costs we experienced during the product's proof of concept period, a $1.1 million decrease in management fees, a $1.0 decrease in interest, net, and $0.7 million of restructuring costs, partially offset by $4.2 million of lower non-cash stock compensation expenses as a result of a recapture of non-cash stock compensation expense from the forfeiture and modification of unvested stock awards, as well as the impact from fewer stock awards issued and lower stock award values, and a $0.6 million decrease in Section 16 officer transition expenses. The same period in 2019 also included $0.4 million of expense to write off R&D tax credits that were no longer realizable.\nIn response to current economic conditions, we have postponed non-essential capital expenditures and undertaken other efficiency efforts. In addition, the headcount reductions undertaken in connection with our business model advancement will contribute to our cost-saving initiatives. We will continue to review our operating expenses and to take actions that support efficient operations, financial flexibility, and optimized liquidity.\nThe valuation of stock options is a critical accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We estimate the fair value of each option on the grant date, or other measurement dates if applicable, using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires us to make predictive assumptions regarding employee exercise behavior, future stock price volatility, and dividend yield.\nThe determination of the net realizable value of our inventories is a critical accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, especially at the early stage of commercialization for our soybean products. At each period-end, we make assumptions regarding projected selling prices for our products considering futures market prices for the underlying agricultural markets and our associated risk management strategies, our anticipated costs, and other factors that take into consideration our limited operating history and compare those prices to the current weighted average costs of our inventories. If our costs are higher than the projected selling prices, then a valuation adjustment is recorded. Changes in our projected selling prices and cost structure will affect the amount of these adjustments over time.\nThe estimated fair values of stock options granted, and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows:\nSelling and Supply Chain Expense\nSelling and Supply Chain Expense\nWe expect net cash used for purchases of land, buildings, and equipment in 2021 to be comparable to 2020, and cash used for purchases of short-term investments to decrease in 2021 as we continue to use cash to fund operations.\n \u2022 identifying strategic partners and licensees and negotiating agreements under the applicable go-to-market strategy; \nResearch and Development Expense\nAdjusted net loss per share, a non-GAAP measure, was $1.23 in 2019, a decrease of $0.45 per share from 2018, driven by the change in adjusted net loss.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nRevenues are recognized as described in our Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized revenue from the sales of high oleic soybean grain, oil, and meal as well as sales of our first hemp product. Historically, we have not recognized revenue from seed transactions because of the grower's commitment to sell their crop to us. We benefit from the cash upon payment and defer the net profit on the seed to inventory and recognize that benefit when the grower delivers grain to us. Beginning in 2021, we expect seed sales to result in revenue because we will not be buying back grain from growers.\nOur liquidity funds our non-discretionary cash requirements and our discretionary spending. Working capital is our principal non-discretionary funding requirement. In addition, we have contractual obligations related to our recurring business operations, primarily related to lease obligations. Our principal discretionary cash spending includes capital expenditures.\nA summary of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 follows:\nCost of goods sold were $35.1 million in 2020, an increase of $25.8 million from 2019, driven by the higher volume of product sold, higher average prices paid for grain as a result of increases in commodity market prices for soybeans and lower costs associated with products sold in 2019 because $3.3 million of Grain Costs were previously expensed as R&D, $2.8 million of unrealized commodity derivative losses from hedging contracts sold to convert our fixed price grain inventory and fixed price Forward Purchase Contracts to floating prices to link them to market, consistent with how we expect to sell the grain, and a $1.3 million increase in net realizable value adjustments to period-end inventories including write-downs of excess seed produced for 2020 plantings. These increases were partially offset by the benefits resulting from the advancement of our soybean product line go-to-market strategy.", "item_7_text": "Net cash used by operating activities increased by $11.7 million in 2019 driven by the increase in our net loss of $11.7 million and a net decrease in cash flows provided by operating assets and liabilities of $5.4 million, primarily from higher inventories and accounts receivable following the commercialization of our high oleic soybean products earlier in 2019, and $1.6 million of cash payments made in 2019 to suppliers for services provided to us in 2018. These uses of cash were partially offset by additional non-cash stock compensation expenses of $4.6 million.\nR&D expenses were $12.2 million in 2019, an increase of $1.9 million from 2018, driven by $1.6 million of higher non-cash stock compensation expenses, $1.4 million of additional personnel costs, $0.7 million of incremental lab supplies and outsourcing costs and $0.6 million from the reversal of payroll tax benefits that are no longer realizable. These increases were partially offset by a $3.3 million decrease in Grain Costs expensed as R&D in 2018.\nRevenue\nConcurrent with entering the lease, Cellectis guaranteed all our obligations under the lease agreement. Cellectis' guarantee of our obligations will terminate at the end of the second consecutive calendar year in which our tangible net worth exceeds $300 million, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. At a point when Cellectis owns 50 percent or less of our outstanding common stock, we have agreed to indemnify Cellectis for any obligations incurred by Cellectis under its guaranty of our obligations under the lease.\nInterest, net was $0.9 million expense, a decrease of $1.0 million from 2019, driven by lower yields and lower cash balances.\nRevenue\nWe are also responsible for all operating costs and expenses associated with the property. If the landlord decides to sell the property, we have a right of first refusal to purchase the property on the same terms offered to any third party.\nNet cash used by investing activities increased by $10.5 million in 2020, driven by our purchases of short-term investments as part of our credit risk diversification strategy.\nInterest, net\nAt December 31, 2020, we have the following contractual obligations:\nRevenue\nNet cash provided (used) by financing activities decreased by $61.0 million in 2019 reflecting the net proceeds from our follow-on offering of common stock in 2018, as well as lower proceeds from stock option exercises of $2.3 million. We also had $0.8 million less proceeds from the sale and leaseback of equipment, and we also made $0.6 million more payments to satisfy statutory income tax withholding requirements relating to the net share settlement upon the vesting of restricted stock units in 2019.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA:\n \u2022 In the second quarter of 2020, our HOLL soybean was deemed a non-regulated article under the Am I Regulated?\u201d process by Biotechnology Regulatory Services of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture. This product represents our second-generation high oleic soybean. \nCost of goods sold was $9.3 million in 2019, an increase of $9.3 million from 2018, reflecting the cost of product sold in the period, and a $0.9 million valuation reserve against our inventories.\nSee below under the heading Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for a discussion of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net loss, the most comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted EBIDA.\nNet Loss\n\nGross Margin\nCost of Goods Sold\nRevenue was $7.3 million in 2019, an increase of $7.1 million from 2018, entirely from increased sales volumes of our high oleic soybean oil and soybean meal following the commercialization of these products in early 2019. During 2019, we generated $1.7 million of high oleic soybean oil revenue. We sold all our high oleic soybean meal production in the year, totaling $5.6 million in revenue.\nWe provide in the table below a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin to gross margin, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We provide adjusted gross margin because we believe that this non-GAAP financial metric provides investors with useful supplemental information at this stage of commercialization as the amounts being adjusted affect the period-to-period comparability of our gross margins and financial performance.\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nWe provide in the table below a reconciliation of adjusted net loss to net loss, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We provide adjusted net loss because we believe that this non-GAAP financial metric provides investors with useful supplemental information at this stage of commercialization as the amounts being adjusted affect the period-to-period comparability of our net losses and financial performance.\n\nWe expect net cash provided by financing activities in 2021 to be similar to 2020, excluding the impact of the 2020 capital raise. To fund our longer-term capital and liquidity needs, we expect we will need to secure additional capital in addition to potential revenue generation as we execute upon our go-to-market strategies.\nBecause our strategy is based on focusing on our core strengths in research and development, gene editing, and trait development, we expect R&D expenses to be the primary area of increase in our expenses. At the same time, because our streamlined business model relies on third parties assuming responsibility for agronomy infrastructure, product management, and commercialization, we expect that S&SC expense will decline as the new models are fully implemented.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nSee below under the heading Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for a discussion of adjusted net loss per share and a reconciliation of net loss per share, the most comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted net loss per share.\n \u2022 During the first quarter of 2020, we were notified that a significant portion of our high fiber wheat plants were damaged in field trials due to improper aerial chemical applications by unaffiliated third parties. While we are continuing to assess the impact of this damage on the overall development process and timeline for this product candidate, it has delayed development by at least one year. This product candidate is currently in Phase 3 of our development pipeline. Our Phase 3 development activities in 2021 will include testing the product concept in field conditions, completing food application studies, and voluntarily consulting with FDA. Given the damage to our field trials described above, the timeline for the trait to be available \nAs we execute upon our streamlined business model with differentiated go-to-market strategies, we expect the composition of our revenues and costs to evolve. Future cash and revenue-generating opportunities are expected to primarily arise from seed sales, trait development and licensing activities, and licensing arrangements. Under trait development and licensing activities, revenues are expected to arise from up-front, annual or milestone, and royalty payments upon the licensees' commercial sale of products. Under licensing arrangements, revenues are expected to arise from up-front, annual and royalty payments upon the licensees' commercial sale of products.\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for our executive, legal, intellectual property, information technology, finance, and human resources functions. Other G&A expenses include facility and information technology expenses not otherwise allocated to R&D or S&SC expenses, professional fees for auditing, tax and legal services, expenses associated with maintaining patents, consulting costs and other costs of our information systems.\nRecent Developments - COVID-19 Update\n \u2022 acquiring or in-licensing other products, technologies, germplasm, or other biological material; \nNet loss per share was $1.21 in 2019, an increase of $0.30 per share from 2018, driven by the change in net loss.\nAdjusted net loss, a non-GAAP measure, was $40.5 million in 2019, a decrease of $16.5 million from 2018.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the next several years. Those expenses and losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. We expect that our expenses will be driven by:\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nG&A expenses were $16.2 million, a decrease of $2.8 million from 2019, driven by a decrease in non-cash stock compensation of $1.4 million as a result of fewer stock awards issued and lower stock award values, and lower personnel costs of $1.4 million, partially offset by an increase in insurance costs.\nNet Realizable Value of Inventories\nOur historical financial information reflects expense allocations for certain support functions that were provided on a centralized basis pursuant to a management services agreement. As a result, such historical financial information may not reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows we would have achieved as a stand-alone company and not a subsidiary of Cellectis during such historical periods. Effective with the end of the third quarter of 2019 we have internalized nearly all the services Cellectis previously provided. Cellectis has also guaranteed the lease of our headquarters facility.\nIn September 2017 we consummated a sale-leaseback transaction with a third party for our corporate headquarters and lab facility.\nNet Loss Per Share\nSelected Achievements and Developments\nOur strategy is based on focusing on our core strengths in research and development, gene editing, and trait development. We deploy a capital-efficient, streamlined business model comprising three differentiated go-to-market strategies. Specific deal structure and the amount and timing of cash flows and revenues are expected to vary depending upon several factors, including cost to develop, size of the opportunity, and the stage at which a partner or licensee enters the development process. Across each of our go-to-market strategies, we seek to develop relationships with strategic customers where our product candidates are most likely to benefit from the counterparty's deep agronomy, product management, and commercialization expertise.\nAdjusted gross margin, a non-GAAP measure, was a negative $7.2 million, or negative 30 percent, in 2020, compared to negative $4.5 million, or negative 61 percent, in 2019. The improvement on a percentage basis was driven by savings from the advancement of our soybean product line go-to-market strategy.\n \u2022 conducting additional breeding and field trials of our current and future products; \nSee below under the heading Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for a discussion of adjusted net loss and a reconciliation of net loss, the most comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted net loss.\nCapital Resources\nWe are a technology company focused on delivering plant-based innovations and solutions with substantial disruption potential across multiple industries. We are a leader in gene editing with exclusive access to proprietary TALEN technology for use in plants, which we used to successfully commercialize the first gene edited food product in the United States. We have a robust development pipeline that spans multiple crops and that is focused on several important trends, including functional nutrition, regenerative agriculture, sustainability, plant-based protein, and animal nutrition.\nIncome Tax Valuation Allowances\nInterest, net\n1 See Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net loss, the most comparable GAAP measure.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments of $30.0 million. All these amounts are convertible to cash within 90 days except for $1.0 million of restricted cash associated with our financing leases. Current liabilities were $7.0 million at December 31, 2020. Accordingly, we have cash and cash equivalents sufficient to fund all short-term obligations as of that date.\nOn May 22, 2018, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock. In the aggregate, we received net proceeds from the follow-on offering of $57.0 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was $29.8 million in 2019, a decrease of $11.0 million from 2018, driven by the changes in R&D, S&SC and G&A expenses, and the increases in negative gross margins described above.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of gross margin to adjusted gross margin:\nManagement fees were $0.3 million in 2020, a decrease of $1.1 million from 2019, as we previously internalized certain services provided by Cellectis, including investor relations, information technology, human resources, legal, and communications.\nThe determination of the income tax valuation allowances requires us to use judgments and assumptions that may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, especially at the early stage of commercialization. We provide deferred taxes for deductible and taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Because we generate losses currently and have reflected a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. If we were to generate profits, the valuation allowance may change.\nThe following discussion of results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 should be read together with -Financial Operations Overview-Anticipated Changes between Revenues and Costs.\u201d\n \u2022 seeking to attract and retain new and existing skilled personnel; \nOn February 19, 2021 Yves Ribeill, Ph.D., Chair of the Board of Directors of Calyxt, Inc., was appointed as the Executive Chair of the Board of Directors and in that capacity, will serve as Calyxt's principal executive officer until the appointment of a successor to James Blome, our former Chief Executive Officer. Pursuant to his employment contract, Mr. Blome is entitled to compensation and benefits as part of this termination without cause, and in the first quarter of 2021 we expect to record up to $2.3 million of cash expense for separation-related payments. The cash payments to Mr. Blome will be made over a period of 24 months from the date his separation agreement is executed, which has not occurred as of the date of this Annual Report, but is expect on or before March 12, 2021.\n \u2022 liability for minimum lease payments for operating leases due within the next five years in an aggregate amount of $0.1 million, of which an immaterial amount is payable in 2021; \nSee below under the heading Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for a discussion of adjusted gross margin and a reconciliation of gross margin, the most comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted gross margin.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to generate losses for the next several years before revenue is enough to support our operating capital requirements. Until we can generate substantial cash flow, we expect to finance a portion of future cash needs through cash on hand, public or private equity or debt financings, government or other third-party funding, and commercialization activities, which may result in various types of revenue streams from seed sales and future development agreements, trait licenses, and technology licensees, including upfront and milestone payments, annual license fees, and royalties. However, additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in enough amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of our activities. Failure to receive additional funding could cause us to cease operations, in part or in full. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities, it could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and increased fixed payment obligations, and these securities may have rights senior to those of our shares of common stock. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition, and prospects.\n\nOur financing needs are subject to change depending on, among other things, the success of our product development efforts, the effective execution of our streamlined business model, our revenue, and our efforts to effectively manage expenses. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial markets and broader economic uncertainties may make obtaining capital through equity or debt financings more challenging and have exacerbated the risk that such capital, if available, may not be available on terms acceptable to us.\nConsidering factors such as cash raised in October 2020, our anticipated cash burn rate, our anticipated expense reduction efforts, our expectations regarding an effective advancement of our go-to-market soybean strategy, and anticipated cash receipts from our product development and technology licensing efforts with partners, we believe our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash as of December 31, 2020, will be enough to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months and into the second half of 2022.\nInterest, net is comprised of interest income resulting from investments of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, unrealized gains and losses on short-term investments, and interest expense on our financing lease obligations. It is also driven by balances, yields, and timing of financing and other capital raising activities.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting requirements for accounting, presentation, and classification of leases. This will result in most leases being capitalized as a right of use asset with a related liability on our balance sheets. Because we are an emerging growth company, the requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those annual periods. We are in the process of analyzing the impact of this standard on our results of operations and financial position.\nWe present adjusted gross margin, a non-GAAP measure that includes the effects of Grain Costs expensed as R&D in a prior period, excludes the effects of commodity derivatives entered into to hedge the change in value of fixed price grain inventories and fixed price Forward Purchase Contracts as the expected impact from these contracts will be fully offset when the underlying grain is sold, and excludes the impact of any net realizable value adjustments to inventories occurring in the period, which would otherwise have been recorded as an adjustment to value in a prior period or would have been recorded in a future period as the underlying products are sold.\nOur expected term represents the period that options granted are expected to be outstanding determined using the simplified method. An increase in the expected term by one year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would increase the grant date fair value by five percent. We estimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility of comparable public companies over the expected term of the option. A one percentage point increase in our volatility assumption, leaving all other assumptions constant, would increase the grant date fair value by one percent. We estimate the risk-free interest rate based on the United States Treasury zero-coupon yield curve at the date of grant for the expected term of the option. A one percentage point increase in the risk-free interest rate, leaving all other assumptions constant, would not change the grant date fair value. We do not nor do we expect to pay dividends.\nWe present adjusted net loss per share, a non-GAAP measure, and define it as net loss per share including the effects of Grain Costs expensed as R&D in a prior period, and excluding the effects of commodity derivatives entered into to hedge the change in value of fixed price grain inventories and fixed price Forward Purchase Contracts as the expected impact from these contracts will be fully offset when the underlying grain is sold, any net realizable value adjustments to inventories occurring in the period, which would otherwise have been recorded as an adjustment to value in a prior period or would have been recorded in a future period as the underlying products are sold, Section 16 officer transition expenses, R&D payroll tax credits that are no longer realizable, restructuring costs, the recapture of non-cash stock compensation expense from the forfeiture and modification of unvested stock awards associated with staffing adjustments made as part of the advancement of our soybean business model, and non-operating expenses, which are primarily gains and losses on foreign exchange transactions and losses on the disposals of land, buildings, and equipment.\nThe accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following policies to be the most critical to understanding our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nAdjusted gross margin, a non-GAAP measure, was negative $4.5 million, or negative 61 percent, compared to negative $2.0 million, or negative 100 percent, in 2018. This was driven by the impact of lower costs associated with products sold in 2019 because $3.3 million of Grain Costs were previously expensed in R&D.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe grain grower contracts require us to pay prices for all grain produced at commodity futures market prices plus a premium. The grain growers have the option to fix their price with us throughout the term of the agreement. The grain grower contracts allow for delivery of grain to us at harvest if so specified when the agreement is executed, otherwise delivery occurs on a date that we elect through August 31 of the following year. We pay for grain within a contractually determined number of days following delivery and final pricing.\n \u2022 addressing the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including implementing expense reduction efforts and seeking to bolster our liquidity position considering changing business needs and uncertain macro-economic conditions; and \nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n</td> </tr>\nWe expect low-single digit growth in these cash expenses over time as we believe we have the necessary foundation to grow and scale up our business.\nNet loss was $39.6 million in 2019, an increase of $11.7 million from 2018, driven by $5.2 million of additional personnel costs, $4.9 million of higher non-cash stock compensation expenses and a $2.2 million negative change in gross margins following the launch of our soybean products, reflecting the early stage of commercialization of our business and the impact of lower costs associated with products sold in 2019 because $3.3 million of Grain Costs were previously expensed as R&D.\nWe incurred losses from operations of $44.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, $39.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and $27.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $166.9 million and expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future.\n \u2022 continuing to advance the R&D of our current and future products; \n \u2022 Also in the second quarter of 2020, we released our non-edited hemp germplasm by selling plants directly to a grower, driving several thousand dollars of revenue. This project leveraged our plant breeding expertise to quickly purify and stabilize key varieties of a partner's germplasm. While not significant to our financial results, this successful project enabled the gathering of valuable insights and data, and it is expected to serve as the base germplasm for the development of other hemp projects expected to launch beginning in 2023. \nFollowing these adjustments, we expect our S&SC expenses will decrease significantly from 2020 to 2021, and then expect low-single digit growth in these cash expenses over time.\nOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CELLECTIS AND COMPARABILITY OF OUR RESULTS\nRevenue was $23.9 million in 2020, an increase of $16.6 million, or 227 percent, from 2019, driven by the sale of a substantial portion of the 2020 grain crop and the completion of the sale of all soybean oil and meal during 2020. The sales of grain were $13.0 million and included all remaining 2019 grain and seed and represent approximately 40 percent of the 2020 grain crop.\n \u2022 In the fourth quarter of 2020, we entered into a research collaboration with NRGene\u00ae that includes the adoption of NRGene's cloud-based genomics platform to support several of our research projects. The genomics solutions, including NRGene's QuickGENETICS\u2122 technology, which analyzes breeding populations, delivers high resolution genetic mapping, and generates unique genetic markers for high value traits, are expected to allow for more comprehensive evaluations to accelerate trait discovery and breeding across multiple crops. We are integrating NRGene's genomic resources to build out our proprietary predictive data analytics, which combines insights, scientific data, predictive algorithms, and data visualization tools to develop customized products to meet specific customer requirements. \nSee below under the heading Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for a discussion of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net loss, the most comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted EBIDA.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of net loss per share to adjusted net loss per share:\nOn October 20, 2020, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock. In the aggregate, we received net proceeds from the follow-on offering of $14.0 million.\n \u2022 liability for minimum lease payments for financing leases due within the next five years in an aggregate amount of $8.0 million, of which $1.8 million is payable in 2021; \nIn all periods prior to January 1, 2019, we considered Forward Purchase Contracts to be derivatives and recorded the contracts at fair market value with changes in value reflected in earnings as R&D expense. Effective January 1, 2019, we designated all Forward Purchase Contracts as normal purchases and as a result no longer consider these agreements to be derivatives. As of that date, any mark-to-market gains or losses associated with those contracts were fixed and were reflected in inventory upon our purchase of the underlying grain.\nWe enter into seed and grain production agreements (Forward Purchase Contracts) with seed producers and growers.\nGross margin was a negative $11.3 million, or negative 47 percent, in 2020, a decrease of $9.3 million or 2,008 basis points from 2019, driven by the higher volume of product sold, the impact of lower costs associated with products sold in 2019 because $3.3 million of Grain Costs were previously expensed as R&D, $2.8 million of unrealized commodity derivative losses from futures contracts sold to hedge our fixed price grain inventory and fixed price Forward Purchase Contracts, and a $1.3 million increase in our net realizable value adjustment to period-end inventories including write-downs of excess seed produced for 2020 plantings. These increases were partially offset by higher selling prices and benefits from the advancement of our soybean product line go-to-market strategy.\nCost of goods sold also includes crush and refining losses that are expensed as incurred since they do not add to the value of the finished products. All other grain and risk management costs, net of the benefit from our seed activity, are capitalized to inventory and relieved to cost of goods sold as the high oleic soybean grain, oil and meal is sold. Cost of goods sold also includes any gains and losses on commodity derivative contracts to hedge fixed price grain inventories and Forward Purchase Contracts. Any valuation adjustments to inventory are recognized as incurred.\nSee below under the heading Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for a discussion of adjusted net loss and a reconciliation of net loss, the most comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted net loss.\nItem 7.\nCellectis has certain contractual rights as well as rights pursuant to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, in each case, provided it maintains threshold beneficial ownership levels in our shares.\nOur headquarters facility is comprised of a 40,000 square-foot office and lab building, greenhouses, and outdoor research plots. We are deemed the owner for accounting purposes. The lease has a term of twenty years with four options to extend its term for five years each subject to there being no default under the lease terms beyond any cure period and us occupying the property at the time of extension. In 2017 we received $7.0 million in connection with the sale of the land and uncompleted facility.\nCost of Goods Sold\nLiquidity\nWe are an early-stage company and have incurred net losses since our inception. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $166.9 million. Our net losses were $44.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAdjusted net loss per share, a non-GAAP measure, was $1.19 in 2020, an improvement of $0.04 per share from 2019, driven by the change in adjusted net loss.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was a loss of $31.6 million in 2020, an increase of $1.8 million from 2019, driven by the changes in expenses.\nFINANCIAL OPERATIONS OVERVIEW\nWe hold an exclusive license from Cellectis that broadly covers the use of engineered nucleases for plant gene editing. This intellectual property covers methods to edit plant genes using chimeric restriction endonucleases,\u201d which include TALEN, CRISPR/Cas9, zinc finger nucleases, and some types of meganucleases.\nOur R&D efforts are central to our business and account for a significant portion of our operating expenses, and as a result, we expect mid-single digit growth in these cash expenses over time.\nTo supplement our audited financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, we have prepared certain non-GAAP measures that include or exclude special items. These non-GAAP measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and should be viewed as supplemental and in addition to our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, other companies may report similarly titled measures, but calculate them differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Management utilizes these non-GAAP metrics as performance measures in evaluating and making operational decisions regarding our business.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nOn July 25, 2017, we completed our IPO of common stock. In the aggregate, we received net proceeds from the IPO of $58.0 million.\n\nNet cash used by investing activities increased by $1.1 million in 2019, driven by purchases of laboratory equipment following the build out of our new headquarters facility that was completed in 2018 as well as for equipment to support the expansion of our R&D pipeline.\nS&SC expenses were $4.4 million in 2020, a decrease of $0.8 million from 2019, driven by a decrease in non-cash stock compensation expense of $1.0 million primarily from a recapture of non-cash stock compensation expense from the forfeiture of unvested stock awards, lower stock award values, and lower marketing and travel expenses, partially offset by additional personnel costs.\nAs previously reported, our operations in Minnesota are classified as critical sector work under the State of Minnesota's COVID-19 executive orders. Accordingly, most of our laboratory workers have continued to work onsite at our headquarters throughout the pandemic, and our R&D programs and seed distribution activities have not experienced material delays. In accordance with our COVID-19 Preparedness Plan, Minnesota executive order requirements, and CDC guidelines, we have implemented health and safety measures for the protection of our onsite workers, have maintained remote work arrangements for our non-laboratory personnel and have implemented, as necessary, appropriate self-quarantine precautions for potentially affected laboratory personnel.\nWe expect cash used by operating activities in 2021 to be lower than 2020 driven by a decrease in net loss and a reduction in net working capital in our soybean product line as a result of the advancement of our go-to-market strategy to a seed sale approach.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting requirements on how to account for credit losses on most financial assets and certain other instruments. This will require the estimation of lifetime expected credit losses and corresponding recognition of allowance for losses on trade and other receivables, loans, and other instruments held at amortized cost. The ASU requires certain recurring disclosures and is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning on or after December 15, 2023. We are in the process of analyzing the impact of this standard on our results of operations.\nWe provide in the table below a reconciliation of adjusted net loss per share to net loss per share, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We provide adjusted net loss per share because we believe that this non-GAAP financial metric provides investors with useful supplemental information at this stage of commercialization as the amounts being adjusted affect the period-to-period comparability of our net losses per share and financial performance.\n\nNet Loss Per Share\nResearch and Development Expense\nTo the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based expense to final intrinsic values. Historical data has a significant bearing on our forward-looking assumptions. Significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then significantly impact the year-over-year comparability of stock-based compensation expense.\nWe also have an equipment financing arrangement that is considered a financing lease. This arrangement has a term of four years for each draw. We were required to deposit cash into a restricted account in an amount equal to the future rent payments required by the lease. As of December 31, 2020, this restricted cash totaled $1.0 million. We have the option to request the return of excess collateral annually in December.\n \u2022 Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we executed a commercialization agreement with S&W Seed Company, a global agricultural company headquartered in Longmont, Colorado, for the exclusive license of an improved quality alfalfa seed in the United States and several geographies outside the United States excluding the European Union, United Kingdom, Ukraine, Russia, and India. The new alfalfa seed will be sold as part of the S&W seed portfolio and branded IQA. This marks our first commercial trait license agreement. \nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\nSee below under the heading Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for a discussion of adjusted gross margin and a reconciliation of gross margin, the most comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted gross margin.\nPrior to 2019, our cost of goods sold represented immaterial costs associated with our out-licensing activities. Costs we incurred associated with the purchasing, storing, transporting, and processing grain and seed, net of proceeds of seed sales (Grain Costs), were expensed as R&D. Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, we began to capitalize all Grain Costs into inventory. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred $3.3 million of Grain Costs that were expensed as R&D. These amounts affect the year-over-year comparability of costs of goods sold, gross margins, and R&D expenses.\nRestructuring costs were $0.7 million in 2020 and reflect the impact of severance and other expenses resulting from the action we initiated in August 2020 to advance our soybean product line go-to-market strategy. There were no restructuring costs in 2019.\nThe lease commenced in May 2018. Under the lease, we pay an annual base rent of eight percent of the total project cost with scheduled increases in rent of 7.5 percent on the sixth, eleventh and sixteenth anniversaries of the start of the lease commencement as well as on the first day of each renewal term. Currently, we pay an annual base rent of $1.4 million.\nWe present adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure and define it as net loss excluding interest, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, the effects of commodity derivatives entered into to hedge the change in value of fixed price grain inventories and fixed price Forward Purchase Contracts as the expected impact from these contracts will be fully offset when the underlying grain is sold, any net realizable value adjustments to inventories occurring in the period, which would otherwise have been recorded as an adjustment to value in a prior period or would have been recorded in a future period as the underlying products are sold, Section 16 officer transition expenses, R&D payroll tax credits that are no longer realizable, restructuring costs, and non-operating expenses, which are primarily gains and losses on foreign exchange transactions and losses on the disposals of land, buildings, and equipment; and including the effects of Grain Costs expensed as R&D in a prior period.\nNet cash provided (used) by financing activities increased by $15.7 million, driven by $14.0 million of net proceeds from our follow-on common stock offering and $1.5 million of Paycheck Protection Program loan proceeds.\nNet Loss\n</table>\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nManagement Fees\nAnticipated Changes Between Revenues and Costs\nManagement fees were $1.3 million in 2019, a decline of $0.9 million from 2018, as we internalized certain services previously provided by Cellectis including investor relations, information technology, human resources, legal, and communications.\nDuring 2020, supply chain disruptions did not have a material impact on our operations. however, a resurgence or prolonging of the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental response measures, and resulting disruptions could rapidly offset such improvements. Moreover, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial markets remain substantial and broader economic uncertainties persist, which may make obtaining capital challenging and have exacerbated the risk that such capital, if available, may not be available on terms acceptable to us. There continues to be significant uncertainty relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact, and many factors could affect our results and operations, including, but not limited to, those discussed under the caption Risk Factors\u201d in the reports we file with the SEC.\nG&A expenses were $19.0 million in 2019, an increase of $5.6 million from 2018, driven by $2.9 million of higher non-cash stock compensation expenses, $2.6 million of additional personnel costs, and $1.0 million of incremental professional services expenses. The increases in personnel costs and professional services expenses are partially offset by the benefit of internalizing certain services previously provided by Cellectis which resulted in lower management fees.\n \u2022 making royalty and other payments under any in-license agreements; \n \u2022 seeking regulatory and marketing approvals for our products; \nManagement Fees\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA\nGross margin was negative $2.0 million or negative 27 percent in 2019, a decrease of $2.2 million from 2018, reflecting the higher costs we have experienced at this early stage of commercialization of our high oleic soybean products.\nCost of Goods Sold and Inventory\nS&SC expenses were $5.2 million in 2019, an increase of $2.8 million from 2018, driven by $1.2 million of additional personnel costs, $0.9 million incremental allocated expenses for facilities and information technology expenses, and $0.4 million of higher non-cash stock compensation expenses, all the result of our commercialization and acreage expansion in 2019.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted net loss:\nGross Margin\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nSale-Leaseback of Headquarters and Lab Facility\nOur primary liquidity source is our cash and cash equivalents, with additional liquidity accessible, subject to market conditions and other factors, from the capital markets.\nNet cash used by operating activities increased by $11.7 million in 2020, driven by the increase in our net loss of $5.2 million, lower non-cash stock compensation expenses of $4.2 million from the recapture of non-cash compensation expense from the forfeiture and modification of unvested stock awards which meant more of our net loss was driven by cash items, lower stock award values, and fewer stock awards granted, and an increase in cash flows used by operating assets and liabilities of $4.2 million, primarily from activity related to our soybean product line.\n for a commercial launch is uncertain, but not expected before 2023.

To the extent that we opportunistically pursue business arrangements that bring innovations developed for North America to new territories, we would be required to incur significant additional regulatory costs in order to comply with applicable regulatory requirements outside the United States.\nDuring 2020 we purchased soybeans and then either further processed them and sold the resulting oil and meal or, following our announcement in August 2020 to move our soybean go-to-market strategy to seed sales, sold grain outright. As of the end of the year we had sold all our 2019 grain and nearly all of the grain delivered to us at harvest in 2020. As of December 31, 2020, our receivables were from two of the world's largest soybean processors and nearly all were collected shortly after year-end. We have sold all our soybean meal and oil and have exited nearly all of our soybean transportation and processing agreements. We will purchase the remainder of the 2020 harvest between January 1, 2021 and August 31, 2021. As we announced in December 2020, ADM has committed to purchase over four million bushels of our grain, which includes all the 2020 crop. We expect to sell that grain throughout 2021. We expect to sell the remaining grain to ADM at market prices, and as a result, we will continue to hedge our fixed price grain inventories and fixed price Forward Purchase Contracts to mitigate the risk changing market prices may have on our margins. In the fourth quarter of 2020, our gross margins and adjusted gross margins (a non-GAAP measure) were negative 47 percent and negative 30 percent, respectively, which reflects our current business strategy and go-to-market strategies.\n \u2022 maintaining, protecting, expanding, and defending our intellectual property portfolio; \n\nThe seed contracts often require us to pay prices for the seed produced at commodity futures market prices plus a premium. The seed growers have the option to fix their price with us throughout the term of the agreement. We pay a portion of the seed cost in December each year and the remainder upon delivery in either the first or second quarter of the following year.\n \u2022 experiencing any delays or encountering issues with any of the above, including due to COVID-19 and its impacts. \nWe provide in the table below a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Because adjusted EBITDA excludes non-cash items and discrete or infrequently occurring items, we believe that adjusted EBITDA provides investors with useful supplemental information about the operational performance of our business and facilitates comparison of our financial results between periods where certain items may vary significantly independent of our business performance.\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019\nSale-Leaseback of Equipment\n \u2022 In August 2020, as part of the broader transition of our business model, we announced a change in the go-to-market strategy for our high oleic soybean products. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we announced that we had contracted to sell all 2020 grain production of our high oleic soybean to Archer Daniels Midland (ADM). The total purchases represent approximately four million bushels of high oleic soybean grain. Sales began in the third quarter of 2020 and will continue throughout 2021, with prices to be determined on the basis of agricultural commodity market prices in effect at the time our planned deliveries of grain are agreed upon. \nSelling and Supply Chain (S&SC) expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for selling our products, acreage acquisition, managing the supply chain, and business development, as well as costs to market our products and an allocation of facility and information technology expenses. In 2020, we made significant staffing adjustments as part of the change in our soybean go-to-market strategy, including adjustments related to soybean processing and product sales.\n \u2022 Forward Purchase Contracts requiring us to make payments over the next five years in an aggregate amount of $21.2 million, of which all is payable in 2021. \nOperating Capital Requirements\nWe present adjusted net loss, a non-GAAP measure, and define it as net loss including the effects of Grain Costs expensed as R&D in a prior period, and excluding the effects of commodity derivatives entered into to hedge the change in value of fixed price grain inventories and fixed price Forward Purchase Contracts as the expected impact from these contracts will be fully offset when the underlying grain is sold, any net realizable value adjustments to inventories occurring in the period, which would otherwise have been recorded as an adjustment to value in a prior period or would have been recorded in a future period as the underlying products are sold, Section 16 officer transition expenses, R&D payroll tax credits that are no longer realizable, restructuring costs, the recapture of non-cash stock compensation expense from the forfeiture and modification of unvested stock awards associated with staffing adjustments made as part of the advancement of our soybean business model, and non-operating expenses, which are primarily gains and losses on foreign exchange transactions and losses on the disposals of land, building, and equipment.\nNon-operating expenses are expenses that are not directly related to our ongoing operations and are primarily comprised of gains and losses from foreign exchange-related transactions and disposals of land, buildings, and equipment.\nExcluding the Grain Costs mentioned above, our R&D expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for personnel who research and develop our product candidates, fees for contractors who support product development and breeding activities, expenses for trait validation, purchasing material and supplies for our laboratories, licensing, an allocation of facility and information technology expenses, and other costs associated with owning and operating our own laboratories. R&D expenses also include costs to write and support the research for filing patents.\nR&D expenses consist of the costs of performing activities to discover and develop products and advance our intellectual property. We recognize R&D expenses as they are incurred. Prior to commercialization of our high oleic soybean products in early 2019, we also reported Grain Costs as R&D expenses.\nSelling and Supply Chain Expense\nRestructuring Costs\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nForward Purchase Contracts\nWe are a majority-owned subsidiary of Cellectis. As of December 31, 2020, Cellectis owned 64.7 percent of our issued and outstanding common stock.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nR&D expenses were $11.1 million in 2020, a decrease of $1.1 million from 2019, driven by lower non-cash stock compensation expense of $1.1 million primarily from a recapture of non-cash stock compensation expense from the forfeiture and modification of unvested stock awards and lower stock award values. The same period in 2019 also included $0.4 million of expense to write off research and development tax credits that were no longer realizable.\nAdjusted net loss, a non-GAAP measure, was $40.3 million in 2020, a decrease of $0.1 million from 2019.\nNon-operating expenses\nOur business is described in greater detail in Item 1. Business-Company Overview.\u201d\nInterest, net\nNet loss per share was $1.32 in 2020, an increase of $0.11 per share from 2019, driven by the change in net loss.\nNet loss was $44.8 million in 2020, an increase of $5.2 million from 2019, driven by a $9.3 million decrease in gross margin following the launch of our high oleic soybean products and the higher costs we experienced during the product's proof of concept period, a $1.1 million decrease in management fees, a $1.0 decrease in interest, net, and $0.7 million of restructuring costs, partially offset by $4.2 million of lower non-cash stock compensation expenses as a result of a recapture of non-cash stock compensation expense from the forfeiture and modification of unvested stock awards, as well as the impact from fewer stock awards issued and lower stock award values, and a $0.6 million decrease in Section 16 officer transition expenses. The same period in 2019 also included $0.4 million of expense to write off R&D tax credits that were no longer realizable.\nIn response to current economic conditions, we have postponed non-essential capital expenditures and undertaken other efficiency efforts. In addition, the headcount reductions undertaken in connection with our business model advancement will contribute to our cost-saving initiatives. We will continue to review our operating expenses and to take actions that support efficient operations, financial flexibility, and optimized liquidity.\nThe valuation of stock options is a critical accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We estimate the fair value of each option on the grant date, or other measurement dates if applicable, using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires us to make predictive assumptions regarding employee exercise behavior, future stock price volatility, and dividend yield.\nThe determination of the net realizable value of our inventories is a critical accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, especially at the early stage of commercialization for our soybean products. At each period-end, we make assumptions regarding projected selling prices for our products considering futures market prices for the underlying agricultural markets and our associated risk management strategies, our anticipated costs, and other factors that take into consideration our limited operating history and compare those prices to the current weighted average costs of our inventories. If our costs are higher than the projected selling prices, then a valuation adjustment is recorded. Changes in our projected selling prices and cost structure will affect the amount of these adjustments over time.\nThe estimated fair values of stock options granted, and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows:\nSelling and Supply Chain Expense\nSelling and Supply Chain Expense\nWe expect net cash used for purchases of land, buildings, and equipment in 2021 to be comparable to 2020, and cash used for purchases of short-term investments to decrease in 2021 as we continue to use cash to fund operations.\n \u2022 identifying strategic partners and licensees and negotiating agreements under the applicable go-to-market strategy; \nResearch and Development Expense\nAdjusted net loss per share, a non-GAAP measure, was $1.23 in 2019, a decrease of $0.45 per share from 2018, driven by the change in adjusted net loss.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nRevenues are recognized as described in our Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized revenue from the sales of high oleic soybean grain, oil, and meal as well as sales of our first hemp product. Historically, we have not recognized revenue from seed transactions because of the grower's commitment to sell their crop to us. We benefit from the cash upon payment and defer the net profit on the seed to inventory and recognize that benefit when the grower delivers grain to us. Beginning in 2021, we expect seed sales to result in revenue because we will not be buying back grain from growers.\nOur liquidity funds our non-discretionary cash requirements and our discretionary spending. Working capital is our principal non-discretionary funding requirement. In addition, we have contractual obligations related to our recurring business operations, primarily related to lease obligations. Our principal discretionary cash spending includes capital expenditures.\nA summary of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 follows:\nCost of goods sold were $35.1 million in 2020, an increase of $25.8 million from 2019, driven by the higher volume of product sold, higher average prices paid for grain as a result of increases in commodity market prices for soybeans and lower costs associated with products sold in 2019 because $3.3 million of Grain Costs were previously expensed as R&D, $2.8 million of unrealized commodity derivative losses from hedging contracts sold to convert our fixed price grain inventory and fixed price Forward Purchase Contracts to floating prices to link them to market, consistent with how we expect to sell the grain, and a $1.3 million increase in net realizable value adjustments to period-end inventories including write-downs of excess seed produced for 2020 plantings. These increases were partially offset by the benefits resulting from the advancement of our soybean product line go-to-market strategy.", "item_7_tables": "Table 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

key points from the MD&A report:\n\nOverview\n- Net loss was $44.8 million in 2020, an increase of $5.2 million from 2019, primarily driven by lower gross margins as the company is in the early stages of commercialization.\n\nRevenue \n- Revenue was $23.9 million in 2020, up 227% from 2019 due to the sale of the majority of the 2020 grain crop and soybean oil and meal inventory.\n\nCosts and Expenses\n- Gross margin was negative $11.3 million (negative 47% of revenue) in 2020 compared to negative $2.0 million (negative 27%) in 2019, reflecting early commercialization. \n- R&D expenses decreased by $1.1 million due to lower stock compensation costs.\n- S&SC expenses decreased by $0.8 million due to lower stock compensation and marketing/travel costs.\n- G&A expenses decreased $2.8 million due to lower stock compensation and personnel costs.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n- Ended 2020 with $30.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.\n- Raised $14 million in a follow-on stock offering in October 2020. \n- Expects lower cash used in operations in 2021 driven by lower net loss.\n\nCOVID-19 Impact\n- Supply chain disruptions have not materially impacted operations thus far.\n- Broader economic uncertainty may make obtaining capital more challenging."}
