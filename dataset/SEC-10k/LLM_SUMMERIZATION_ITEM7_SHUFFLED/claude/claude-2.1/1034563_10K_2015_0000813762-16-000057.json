Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our present business and the results of operations together with our present financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (this \"Report\").\nOverview\nIcahn Enterprises L.P. ( Icahn Enterprises\u201d) is a master limited partnership formed in Delaware on February 17, 1987. Icahn Enterprises Holdings L.P. ( Icahn Enterprises Holdings\u201d) is a limited partnership formed in Delaware on February 17, 1987. References to \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us\" herein include both Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings and their subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.\nIcahn Enterprises owns a 99% limited partner interest in Icahn Enterprises Holdings. Icahn Enterprises G.P. Inc. ( Icahn Enterprises GP\u201d), which is owned and controlled by Mr. Carl C. Icahn, owns a 1% general partner interest in each of Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings. Icahn Enterprises Holdings and its subsidiaries own substantially all of our assets and liabilities and conduct substantially all of our operations. Therefore, the financial results of Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings are substantially the same, with differences relating primarily to debt, as discussed further in Note 10, \"Debt,\" to the consolidated financial statements, and to the allocation of the general partner interest, which is reflected as an aggregate 1.99% general partner interest in the financial statements of Icahn Enterprises. In addition to the above, Mr. Icahn and his affiliates owned 117,033,818, or approximately 89.0%, of Icahn Enterprises' outstanding depositary units as of December 31, 2015.\nWe are a diversified holding company owning subsidiaries currently engaged in the following continuing operating businesses: Investment, Automotive, Energy, Metals, Railcar, Gaming, Mining, Food Packaging, Real Estate and Home Fashion. We also report the results of our Holding Company, which includes the results of certain subsidiaries of Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings (unless otherwise noted), and investment activity and expenses associated with the Holding Company.\nOn February 28, 2016, Icahn Enterprises issued a proposal to the board of directors of Federal-Mogul to purchase the shares of Federal-Mogul common stock not owned by us in a merger transaction pursuant to which Federal-Mogul shareholders would receive $7.00 per share in cash for their Federal-Mogul shares.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Financial Results\nOverview\nOur operating businesses are managed on a decentralized basis. Due to the structure of our business, we discuss the results of operations below by individual reportable segments. Refer to Note 3, Operating Units,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements for a description of each of our reporting segments and Note 13, \"Segment and Geographic Reporting,\" for a reconciliation of each of our reporting segment's results of operations to our consolidated results.\nThe following table summarizes total revenues, net (loss) income and net (loss) income attributable to Icahn Enterprises for each of our reporting segments and our Holding Company for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>

(\"Icahn Partners\"), Icahn Partners Master Fund LP, Icahn Partners Master Fund II LP and Icahn Partners Master Fund III LP (collectively, the \"Master Funds\", and together with Icahn Partners, the \"Investment Funds\"), through which we invest our proprietary capital. Effective January 1, 2014, Icahn Partners Master Fund II LP and Icahn Partners Master Fund III LP were merged with and into Icahn Partners. We and certain of Mr. Icahn's wholly owned affiliates are the sole investors in the Investment Funds. Icahn Onshore LP and Icahn Offshore LP (together, the \"General Partners\") act as the general partner of Icahn Partners and the Master Funds, respectively. The General Partners provide investment advisory and certain administrative and back office services to the Investment Funds but do not provide such services to any other entities, individuals or accounts. Interests in the Investment Funds are not offered to outside investors.\nMr. Icahn, along with his affiliates (excluding Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings), makes investments in the Investment Funds. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the total fair market value of investments in the Investment Funds made by Mr. Icahn and his affiliates was approximately $4.1 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively.\nOur Interests in the Investment Funds\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had investments with a fair market value of approximately $3.4 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, in the Investment Funds.\nOur share of the Investment Funds' net (losses) profits through our interests in the Investment Funds was $(760) million, $(305) million, and $812 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nReturns\nThe following table sets forth performance information for the Investment Funds for the comparative periods presented.

These losses were partially offset by gains in long equity positions in a few of their largest core holdings as well as gains in their short positions, including broad market hedges.\nThe Investment Funds' aggregate return was -7.4% for 2014, due to losses in their short equity exposure, primarily through broad market hedges, as well as other losses in long equity positions including energy. These losses were partially offset by gains in long equity positions in a few of their largest core holdings.\nThe Investment Funds' aggregate return was 30.8% for 2013 primarily due to gains in their long exposure, primarily in a few of the largest core holdings. These gains were partially offset by losses in their short equity exposure, including broad market hedges as equity markets rallied in 2013.\nSince inception in November 2004, the Investment Funds' gross return is 171.1%, representing an annualized rate of return of 9.3% through December 31, 2015.\nAutomotive\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>6,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe conduct our Automotive segment through our majority ownership in Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation (\"Federal-Mogul\") and through our wholly owned subsidiary, IEH Auto Parts Holding LLC (\"IEH Auto\"), which acquired substantially all of the auto parts assets in the United States of Uni-Select, Inc. through an acquisition that was consummated during the second quarter of 2015. See Note 3, \"Operating Units - Automotive,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this acquisition. Intercompany transactions between Federal-Mogul and IEH Auto have been eliminated in consolidation and the discussion below is net of eliminations.\nOn February 3, 2016, pursuant to a tender offer, Icahn Enterprises acquired a majority of the outstanding shares of Pep Boys - Manny, Moe & Jack (\"Pep Boys\"), a leading aftermarket provider of automotive service, tires, parts and accessories across the United States and Puerto Rico. On February 4, 2016, Icahn Enterprises completed the acquisition of the remaining outstanding shares of Pep Boys and our wholly owned subsidiary, IEP Parts Acquisition LLC, merged with and into Pep Boys, with Pep Boys surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Icahn Enterprises Holdings. The total value for the acquisition of Pep Boys was approximately $1.2 billion, including the fair value of our equity interest in Pep-Boys just prior to our acquisition of a controlling interest. Pep Boys' operations will comprise a portion of our Automotive segment and will be operated independently of Federal-Mogul and IEH Auto.\nFederal-Mogul is a leading global supplier of a broad range of components, accessories and systems to the automotive, small engine, heavy-duty, marine, railroad, agricultural, off-road, aerospace and energy, industrial and transport markets, including customers in both the original equipment manufacturers and servicers ( OE\u201d) market and the replacement market ( aftermarket\u201d). Federal-Mogul's customers include the world's largest automotive OEs and major distributors and retailers in the independent aftermarket.\nFederal-Mogul operates with two end-customer focused businesses. The Powertrain business focuses on original equipment products for automotive, heavy duty and industrial applications. Powertrain operates manufacturing facilities in 19 countries and derived 35% of its 2015 OE sales in North America, 46% in Europe, the Middle-East and Africa (\"EMEA\"), and 19% in the rest of the world (\"ROW\"). The Motorparts business sells and distributes a broad portfolio of products in the global aftermarket, while also serving original equipment manufacturers with products including braking, chassis, wipers, and other vehicle components. Motorparts operates manufacturing sites in 15 countries and distribution centers and warehouses in 14 countries. Motorparts derived 56% of its sales through North America, 37% in EMEA, and 7% in ROW.\nFederal-Mogul's Annual Report on Form 10-K contains a detailed description of its business, products, industry, operating strategy and associated risks. Federal-Mogul's filings with the SEC are available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.\nIEH Auto is a leading automotive parts distributor for domestic and imported vehicles and has 34 distribution centers and satellite locations and 264 corporate-owned parts stores in the United States and supports a network of more than 2,000 independent parts stores. Through its locations, IEH Auto sells predominantly to commercial aftermarket customers in the do-it-for-me market as well as retail and do-it-yourself customers. IEH Auto operates independently of Federal-Mogul.\nMajor Influences Impacting Results of Operations\nOur Automotive segment is affected by the following trends and market conditions:\nGlobal Vehicle Production Levels\nGlobal vehicle production increased by 1.3% in 2015. European vehicle production rose 4.1% from 2014 levels. North American vehicle production increased 3.6%, with positive growth in Mexico and the United States. Vehicle production in the Asia-Pacific region increased just under 1% in 2015, reaching another record high. Among the major regions, only South America posted a decline in 2015, down 19.3%.\nGlobal Vehicle Sales Levels\nGlobal vehicle sales increased by 1.8% in 2015. European vehicle sales rose 3.5% from 2014 levels. North American vehicles sales increased 6.3%, with positive growth in Canada, Mexico and the United States. Vehicle sales in the Asia-Pacific\nregion increased 1.5% in 2015, reaching another record high. Among the major regions, only South America posted a decline in 2015 which was down 21.1%.\nPart Replacement Trends\nThe strength of the aftermarket business is influenced by several key drivers. These include the vehicle population (or \"parc\"), average vehicle age, fuel prices and vehicle distance traveled. The vehicle parc is estimated to have expanded in most major markets, including the United States, Japan, China, and Germany. Average vehicle ages also increased, despite growth in new vehicle sales, in most regions.\nRecent Decline In Oil Prices\nThe recent decline in oil prices results in lower fuel prices for consumers. Lower fuel prices provide consumers with more discretionary income for vehicle repairs and tends to encourage more driving miles, which in turn accelerates wear on vehicle components, accelerating the need for replacements. Low fuel prices also encourage more vehicle sales, which increases demand for parts from OEMs.\nForeign currencies\nGiven the global nature of our operations, we are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchanges rates. During 2015, foreign currency fluctuations had a considerable effect on our reported earnings in U.S. dollars compared to 2014.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nConsolidated net sales increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year by $472 million (6%) (net of certain intercompany activity), of which $396 million is attributable to the acquisition of IEH Auto during 2015 and $76 million is attributable to Federal-Mogul.\nFederal-Mogul's net sales were negatively impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against several global currencies which resulted in an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $642 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Federal-Mogul's sales volumes increased by $718 million. This sales growth is comprised of an increase in the Powertrain business' external sales of $427 million, reflecting the inclusion of the acquisition of certain engine components business of TRW Automotive Holdings Corp.'s (\"TRW\") as well as an increase in volume for the quarter. External sales in the Motorparts business increased by $291 million (net of intercompany eliminations), driven primarily by the acquisitions of Affinia Group Inc. (\"Affinia\") and Honeywell International Inc.'s (\"Honeywell\") brake component business.\nThe Powertrain business generated approximately 63% of its sales outside of the United States and the resulting currency movements decreased sales by $407 million. On a constant dollar basis, Powertrain external sales increased 12% compared to the same period in 2014. The increase in Powertrain's sales reflects the inclusion of the acquisition of certain assets of the TRW engine components business, as well as increases in volume which, together, increased sales by $427 million. This figure includes the impact of customer price decreases of $28 million. Including the impact of sales from acquisitions, the Powertrain business' sales in North America, EMEA and ROW grew by 3.3%, 6.3% and 1%, respectively.\nExcluding the unfavorable currency impact of $235 million, Motorparts' external sales increased by $291 million (net of intercompany eliminations). This increase was primarily due to additional sales related to the Honeywell braking and Affinia chassis component acquisitions. Including the impact of sales from acquisitions, the Motorparts business' sales in North America, EMEA and ROW grew by 1.4%, 4.8% and 1.6%, respectively.\nThe IEH Auto acquisition contributed $396 million in net sales for the period June 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015. IEH Auto is a service organization engaged in the distribution of automotive aftermarket parts. Through its locations, IEH Auto sells predominantly to commercial aftermarket customers in the \"do-it-for-me\" market as well as \"do-it-yourself\" customers.\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $317 million (5%) as compared to the prior year (net of certain intercompany activity). The increase attributable to Federal-Mogul was primarily due to an increase in sales volumes in both the Powertrain and Motorparts businesses, reflecting an inclusion of the acquisitions of the TRW engine component business, the Affinia chasis business as well as the Honeywell brake component business. In addition, cost of goods sold increased due to the IEH Auto acquisition.\nGross margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $155 million (15%) compared to the prior year (net of certain intercompany activity). Gross margin was 16% and 14% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The improvement in gross margin percentage over the respective periods was primarily attributable to the acquisition of IEH Auto during 2015 whose product sales margins are higher than those of Federal-Mogul's.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nConsolidated net sales increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 by $412 million (6%) as compared to the corresponding prior year period. Excluding dispositions of $119 million and unfavorable foreign currency impacts of $51 million, sales organically increased by $582 million or 9% on a constant dollar basis. This increase is driven by sales growth in the Powertrain business of $301 million (8%) and an increase in sales in the Motorparts business of $281 million (10%), driven by the Affinia chassis and the Honeywell brake component business acquisitions.\nThe Powertrain business' sales increase of $301 million is driven by an increase in sales volumes of $330 million, offset by customer price reductions of $29 million. This increase is attributable to higher sales volumes and market share gains across all regions of the world. Including the impact of sales from acquisitions, the Powertrain business' sales in North America, EMEA and ROW grew by 3.0%, 3.0% and 1.9%, respectively.\nNet sales in the Motorparts business increased by $281 million primarily due to the Affinia chassis and the Honeywell brake component acquisitions. Including the impact of sales from acquisitions, the Motorparts business' sales in North America, EMEA and ROW grew by 3.0%, 5.0% and 1.1%, respectively.\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $375 million (6%) as compared to the corresponding prior year period. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to acquisitions.\nGross margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $37 million (4%) as compared to the corresponding prior year period. Gross margin was 14% and 15% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in the gross margin percentage over the respective periods was primarily due to costs incurred related to Motorparts business strategic initiatives as well as unfavorable foreign currency impact.\nEnergy\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

In addition, as of December 31, 2015, Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings directly owned approximately 4.0% of the total outstanding common stock of CVR Refining.\nCVR is a diversified holding company primarily engaged in the petroleum refining and nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing industries through its holdings in CVR Refining, LP ( CVR Refining\u201d) and CVR Partners, LP ( CVR Partners\u201d), respectively. CVR Refining is an independent petroleum refiner and marketer of high value transportation fuels. CVR Partners produces nitrogen fertilizers in the form of urea ammonium nitrate (\"UAN\") and ammonia. As of December 31, 2015, CVR owned 100% of the general partners of CVR Refining and CVR Partners and approximately 66% of the outstanding common units of CVR Refining and 53% of the outstanding common units of CVR Partners. Subsequent to the completion of the pending mergers as discussed below, it is estimated that CVR will hold approximately 34% of the outstanding common units of CVR Partners and 100% of the general partner interest.\nCVR's Annual Report on Form 10-K contains a detailed description of its business, products, industry, operating strategy and associated risks. CVR's filings with the SEC are available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.\nPending Mergers\nAs further discussed in Note 3, \"Operating Units - Energy,\" on August 9, 2015, CVR Partners entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Rentech Nitrogen Partners, L.P. (\"Rentech Nitrogen\") and Rentech Nitrogen GP, LLC (\"Rentech Nitrogen GP\"), pursuant to which CVR Partners would acquire Rentech Nitrogen and Rentech Nitrogen GP by merging two newly-created direct wholly owned subsidiaries of CVR Partners with and into those entities with Rentech Nitrogen and Rentech Nitrogen GP continuing as surviving entities and wholly owned subsidiaries of CVR Partners (together, the \"CVR Partners Mergers\"). In accordance with US GAAP, our Energy segment anticipates accounting for the CVR Partners Mergers as an acquisition of a business with CVR Partners as the acquirer. The completion of the CVR Partners Mergers is subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions.\nMajor Influences on Results of Operations\nThe earnings and cash flows of our Energy segment's petroleum business are primarily affected by the relationship between refined product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks that are processed and blended into refined products. The cost to acquire crude oil and other feedstocks and the price for which refined products are ultimately sold depend\non factors beyond its control, including the supply of and demand for crude oil, as well as gasoline and other refined products which, in turn, depend on, among other factors, changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and foreign political affairs, production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels and the extent of government regulation. Because the petroleum business applies first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") accounting to value its inventory, crude oil price movements may impact net income in the short term because of changes in the value of its unhedged on-hand inventory. The effect of changes in crude oil prices on our results of operations is influenced by the rate at which the prices of refined products adjust to reflect these changes.\nThe prices of crude oil and other feedstocks and refined product prices are also affected by other factors, such as product pipeline capacity, local market conditions and the operating levels of competing refineries. Crude oil costs and the prices of refined products have historically been subject to wide fluctuations. Widespread expansion or upgrades of competitors' facilities, price volatility, international political and economic developments and other factors are likely to continue to play an important role in refining industry economics. These factors can impact, among other things, the level of inventories in the market, resulting in price volatility and a reduction in product margins. Moreover, the refining industry typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in demand for refined products, such as increases in the demand for gasoline during the summer driving season and for home heating oil during the winter, primarily in the Northeast. In addition to current market conditions, there are long-term factors that may impact the demand for refined products. These factors include mandated renewable fuels standards, proposed climate change laws and regulations, and increased mileage standards for vehicles. The petroleum business is also subject to the Renewable Fuel Standard (\"RFS\") of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"), which requires it to either blend \"renewable fuels\" with its transportation fuels or purchase renewable fuel credits, known as renewable identification numbers (\"RINs\"), in lieu of blending.\nThe cost of RINs for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was approximately $124 million, $127 million and $181 million, respectively. The price of RINs has been extremely volatile and has increased over the last year. The future cost of RINs for the petroleum business is difficult to estimate. Additionally, the cost of RINs is dependent upon a variety of factors, which include the availability of RINs for purchase, the price at which RINs can be purchased, transportation fuel production levels, the mix of the petroleum business' petroleum products, as well as the fuel blending performed at its refineries and downstream terminals, all of which can vary significantly from period to period. Based upon recent market prices of RINs and current estimates related to the other variable factors, the petroleum business estimates that the total cost of RINs will be approximately $140 million to $190 million for the year ending December 31, 2016.\nRefining margin per crude oil throughput barrel is a measurement calculated as the difference between net sales and cost of goods sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization, direct operating expenses and fair value inventory adjustments) and refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel adjusted for FIFO impact is a measurement calculated as the difference between net sales and cost of goods sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization, direct operating expenses and fair value inventory adjustments) adjusted for FIFO impacts. Refining margin and refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact are non-GAAP measures that we believe are important to investors in evaluating our Energy segment refineries' performance as a general indication of the amount above our Energy segment's cost of goods sold (taking into account the impact of utilization of FIFO) they are able to sell refined products. We believe that refining margin and refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel are important to enable investors to better understand and evaluate our Energy segment's ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in the review of our overall financial, operational and economic performance. In addition, we believe that presenting refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel adjusted for FIFO impact is useful to investors because this measure more accurately reflects the current operating environment.\nIn order to derive the refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel, our Energy segment utilizes the total dollar figures for refining margin, as derived above, and divides that by the applicable number of crude oil throughput barrels for the period. Our Energy segment's calculation of refining margin and refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact may differ from calculations of other companies in the industry, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Under our Energy segment's FIFO accounting method, changes in crude oil prices can cause fluctuations in the inventory valuation of our Energy segment's crude oil, work in process and finished goods, thereby resulting in favorable FIFO impacts when crude oil prices increase and unfavorable FIFO impacts when crude oil prices decrease.\nIn order to assess the operating performance of the nitrogen fertilizer business, CVR calculates the product pricing at gate as an input to determine its operating margin. Product pricing at gate represents net sales less freight revenue divided by product sales volume in tons. CVR believes product pricing at gate is a meaningful measure because it sells products at its plant gate and terminal locations' gates (sold gate) and delivered to the customer's designated delivery site (sold delivered). The relative percentage of sold gate versus sold delivered can change period to period. The product pricing at gate provides a measure that is consistently comparable period to period.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nNet sales for the petroleum business, before eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period decreased by $3.7 billion (42%), primarily due to significantly lower sales prices of transportation fuels and by-products. The average sales price per gallon for the year ended December 31, 2015 for gasoline and distillate decreased by approximately 36% and 42%, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year period. Overall sales volume decreased by approximately 3% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period. Sales volumes for 2015 were impacted by decreased production as a result of the major scheduled turnaround completed at the Coffeyville refinery in the fourth quarter of 2015 and lower purchased product volumes for resale. Sales volumes for 2014 were impacted by reduced crude oil throughput and production as a result of the Coffeyville refinery shutdown following the isomerization unit fire during the third quarter of 2014 and fluid catalytic cracking unit (\"FCCU\") outage at the Wynnewood refinery during the fourth quarter of 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, CVR's petroleum business sold approximately 40.1 million and 33.1 million barrels of gasoline and distillate, respectively, with an average sales price per gallon for gasoline and distillate of $1.61 and $1.62, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2014, CVR's petroleum business sold approximately 40.3 million and 34.9 million barrels of gasoline and distillate, respectively, with an average sales price per gallon for gasoline and distillate of $2.53 and $2.81, respectively.\nNet sales for the fertilizer business, before eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period decreased by $10 million (3%), primarily due to lower UAN sales prices and UAN sales volumes, partially offset by higher ammonia sales volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2015, CVR sold 939,547 and 32,326 tons of UAN and ammonia, respectively, with a sales price of $275 and $533 per ton, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2014, CVR sold 951,043 and 24,378 tons of UAN and ammonia, respectively, with a sales price of $288 and $536 per ton, respectively. On-stream factors (total number of hours operated divided by total hours in the reporting period) for the gasification, ammonia and UAN units were 90.2%, 87.5% and 87.3%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 96.8%, 92.6% and 92.0%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nCost of goods sold for the petroleum business, before eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period decreased by $3.8 billion (45%), primarily due to a decrease in cost of consumed crude oil and purchased products for resale. The decrease in consumed crude oil cost was due to a decrease in crude oil throughput volume and crude oil prices. The average cost per barrel of crude oil consumed for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $47.86 as compared to $92.57 for the comparable prior period, a decrease of approximately 48%. The impact of FIFO accounting also impacted cost of goods sold during the comparable periods. Under the FIFO accounting method, changes in crude oil prices can cause fluctuations in the inventory valuation of crude oil, work in process and finished goods, thereby resulting in a favorable FIFO inventory impact when crude oil prices increase and an unfavorable FIFO inventory impact when crude oil prices decrease. For the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the petroleum business had unfavorable FIFO inventory impacts of $60 million and $161 million, respectively. The major factor contributing to the unfavorable FIFO impact for the year ended December 31, 2014 was the decline in the market price of West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\"), a grade of crude oil used as a benchmark in oil pricing, from $95.44 at the beginning of 2014 to $53.27 on December 31, 2014. The FIFO inventory impact for 2014 included a lower of cost or market write-down of $37 million, which was recorded in the fourth quarter as a result of the significant decline in the market price of crude oil.\nCost of goods sold for the petroleum business includes cost of crude oil, other feedstocks and blendstocks, purchased products for resale, RINs, transportation distribution costs, costs associated with the operations of CVR's refineries (such costs are collectively referred to as \"direct operating expenses\") such as energy and utility costs, property taxes, catalyst and chemical costs, repairs and maintenance and labor and environmental compliance costs. In addition, cost of goods sold includes depreciation and amortization.\nRefining margin per barrel of crude oil throughput increased to $14.45 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $11.38 for the corresponding prior year period. Refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact increased to $15.31 per crude oil throughput barrel for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $13.62 per crude oil throughput barrel for the corresponding prior year period. Gross margin per barrel increased to $5.78 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to gross margin per barrel of $3.42 in the corresponding prior year period. The increase in refining margin and gross margin per barrel was primarily due to the higher unfavorable FIFO impact in 2014 as a result of significant decline in the market price of crude oil.\nThe fertilizer business' cost of goods sold, before eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period decreased by $3 million (1%), primarily due to lower consumption of pet coke mostly due to the decrease in production during the turnaround and the Linde air separation unit related downtime, lower pet coke pricing, decreased distribution costs, freight expenses and purchased ammonia.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to 2013\nNet sales for the petroleum business, before eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year period increased by $146 million (2%), primarily due to higher overall sales volume largely offset by lower sales prices for gasoline and distillates. Sales volume increased by approximately 8% for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year period. Sales volumes for 2014 were impacted by reduced crude oil throughput and production as a result of the Coffeyville refinery shutdown following the isomerization unit fire during the third quarter of 2014 and FCCU outage at the Wynnewood refinery during the fourth quarter of 2014. Sales volumes for 2013 were impacted by downtime associated with the FCCU outage at the Coffeyville refinery during the third quarter of 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, CVR's petroleum business sold approximately 40.3 million and 34.9 million barrels of gasoline and distillate, respectively, with an average sales price per gallon for gasoline and distillate of $2.53 and $2.81, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2013, CVR's petroleum business sold approximately 37.8 million and 30.6 million barrels of gasoline and distillate, respectively, with an average sales price per gallon for gasoline and distillate of $2.72 and $3.02, respectively.\nNet sales for the fertilizer business, before eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year period decreased by $25 million (8%), primarily due to lower UAN sales prices and ammonia sales volumes, partially offset by higher UAN sales volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2014, CVR sold 951,043 and 24,378 tons of UAN and ammonia, respectively, with a sales price of $288 and $536 per ton, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2013, CVR sold 904,596 and 40,535 tons of UAN and ammonia, respectively, with sales price of $315 and $660 per ton, respectively. On-stream factors (total number of hours operated divided by total hours in the reporting period) for the gasification, ammonia and UAN units were 96.8%, 92.6% and 92.0%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 95.6%, 94.4% and 91.9%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nCost of goods sold for the petroleum business, before eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year period increased by $550 million (7%), primarily due to an increase in cost of consumed oil and refined fuels purchased for resale. The average cost per barrel of crude oil consumed for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $92.57 compared to $95.05 for the comparable period of 2013, a decrease of approximately 3%. Sales volume of refined fuels increased by approximately 8%. The impact of FIFO accounting also impacted cost of goods sold during the comparable periods. Under the FIFO accounting method, changes in crude oil prices can cause fluctuations in the inventory valuation of crude oil, work in process and finished goods, thereby resulting in a favorable FIFO inventory impact when crude oil prices increase and an unfavorable FIFO inventory impact when crude oil prices decrease. For the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the petroleum business had an unfavorable FIFO inventory impact of $161 million and a favorable FIFO inventory impact of $21 million, respectively. The major factor contributing to the unfavorable FIFO impact for the year ended December 31, 2014 was the decline in the market price of WTI from $95.44 at the beginning of 2014 to $53.27 on December 31, 2014. The FIFO inventory impact for 2014 includes a lower of cost or market write-down of $37 million, which was recorded in the fourth quarter as a result of the significant decline in the market price of crude oil.\nCost of goods sold for the petroleum business includes cost of crude oil, other feedstocks and blendstocks, purchased products for resale, RINs, transportation distribution costs, costs associated with the operations of CVR's refineries (such costs are collectively referred to as \"direct operating expenses\") such as energy and utility costs, property taxes, catalyst and chemical costs, repairs and maintenance and labor and environmental compliance costs. In addition, cost of goods sold includes depreciation and amortization.\nRefining margin per barrel of crude oil throughput decreased to $11.38 for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $16.90 for the corresponding prior year period. Refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact was $13.62 per crude oil throughput barrel for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $16.59 per crude oil throughput barrel for the corresponding prior year period. Gross margin per barrel decreased to $3.42 for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to gross margin per barrel of $9.48 in the corresponding prior year period. The decrease in refining margin and gross margin per barrel was primarily due to a decrease in sales price for gasoline and distillate. The average sales price for both gasoline and distillates declined approximately 7% for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year period.\nThe fertilizer business' cost of goods sold, before eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year period increased by $18 million (9%), primarily due to increased distribution costs mostly due to the increase in railcar regulatory inspections and repairs as well as increased ammonia purchases, partially offset by lower freight and pet coke expenses. The increase in railcar regulatory inspections and repairs is related to a larger portion of the fertilizer business' fleet due for regulatory inspections and related repairs during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year period.\nMetals\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>929\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>948\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(45\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSummarized ferrous tons and non-ferrous pounds sold for 2015, 2014 and 2013 are as follows:\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in 000s)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ferrous tons sold\n</td> <td>850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,444\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-ferrous pounds sold\n</td> <td>117,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>230,571\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe scrap metals business is highly cyclical and is substantially dependent upon the overall economic conditions in the U.S. and other global markets. Ferrous and non-ferrous scrap has been historically vulnerable to significant declines in consumption and product pricing during prolonged periods of economic downturn or stagnation.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $350 million (49%) as compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower ferrous and non-ferrous shipment volumes and selling prices.\nFerrous shipments decreased by 359,000 gross tons (30%) and average pricing decreased by $138 per gross ton (37%) for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year. The shipment decrease was attributable to reduced demand from domestic steel mills, low iron ore pricing, low export demand drawing coastal scrap into the areas where PSC Metals operates, and to the negative impact of extremely low market prices on the availability of feedstock. Ferrous market prices at the end of 2015 were at the lowest levels seen since early 2009, during the great recession. Non-ferrous shipment volumes decreased by 29,504,000 pounds (20%) and average selling prices decreased by $0.17 per pound (20%), primarily driven by the effects of steep market price declines in 2015. Shipments from an aluminum ingot tolling operation, closed at the end of March 2014, accounted for 24% of the year on year volume decrease for non-ferrous shipments.\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $322 million (44%) compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower shipment volumes and lower material and processing costs. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was a loss of 12% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to a loss of 2% for the prior year period. While material margin component of the gross margin improved during 2015 as compared to 2014, processing costs, as a percentage of net sales, increased over the respective periods. The improvement in material margin component of the gross margin reflected improved buying efforts despite the unfavorable impact of increased competition for shredder feedstock and lower pricing for non-ferrous auto shredder residue. Processing costs, as a percentage of net sales, increased due to decreases in sales volumes and market prices over the respective periods. PSC Metals continues to expend considerable effort to bring costs in line with lower volumes and market pricing. During 2015 PSC Metals closed nine feeder yards in order to better align its cost structure with the current economic climate.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased by $218 million (23%) compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower ferrous and non-ferrous shipment volumes and selling prices. Shipment volumes were lower in 2014 than in 2013 for all product lines except secondary plate, and average prices were lower for all product lines except brokerage.\nFerrous shipments decreased by 235,000 gross tons (16%) while average pricing was $4 per gross ton (1%) higher during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the prior year period. The volume decrease was largely attributable to raw material shortages and transportation problems caused by severe weather conditions during the first quarter of 2014, to general material supply constraints, and to a poor export market that increased competition for limited domestic demand. The increase in average pricing for 2014 as compared to the prior year period was largely driven by higher market prices (4%) for ferrous scrap during the first nine months of 2014. A $50 per gross ton market price drop in the fourth quarter of 2014 reduced the full year-over-year price differential to 1% favorable. Non-ferrous shipment volumes decreased by 83,128,000 pounds (36%),\nprimarily driven by lower shipments of aluminum products due to the exit from aluminum tolling activities at the end of the first quarter of 2014 and to a refocus of aluminum shredding capacity in 2014. Average selling prices for non-ferrous decreased $0.03 per pound (3%) due to lower market pricing.\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased by $220 million (23%) compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower shipment volumes and lower material and processing costs. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was a loss of 2% for each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, as margins continued to be negatively impacted by ongoing competitive pressure for shredder feedstock.\nRailcar\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Sales/Other Revenues From Operations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Manufacturing\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>864\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Railcar leasing\n</td> <td>459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>277\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Railcar services\n</td> <td>74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eliminations\n</td> <td>(613\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(666\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(475\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>739\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of Goods Sold/Other Expenses From Operations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Manufacturing\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>667\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Railcar leasing\n</td> <td>196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>131\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Railcar services\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eliminations\n</td> <td>(485\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(495\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(366\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>486\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Margin:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Manufacturing\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>197\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Railcar leasing\n</td> <td>263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>146\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Railcar services\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eliminations\n</td> <td>(128\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(171\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(109\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>253\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe conduct our Railcar segment through our majority ownership interests in American Railcar Industries, Inc. (\"ARI\") and American Railcar Leasing, LLC (\"ARL\").\nARI's Annual Report on Form 10-K contains a detailed description of its business, products, industry, operating strategy and associated risks. ARI's filings with the SEC are available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.\nThe North American railcar market has been, and our Railcar segment expects it to continue to be, highly cyclical. The tank railcar market continues to soften, which we believe is driven by multiple factors including record high deliveries of tank railcars in recent years. Additionally, the recent volatility in oil prices and uncertainty surrounding the May 2015 release of regulations related to tank railcars in the U.S. and Canada have led to reduced demand for railcars in the energy transportation industry. Customers continue to weigh the costs versus benefits of investing in new tank railcars or modifying their existing tank railcars for flammable service. Our Railcar segment cannot assure you that hopper or tank railcar demand will maintain its current pace or return to historical average levels, that demand for any railcar types or railcar services will improve, or that our railcar backlog, orders or shipments will track industry-wide trends.\nOur Railcar segment continues to invest capital and evaluate opportunities to further expand its manufacturing flexibility and repair capacity. During 2015 our Railcar segment completed three repair expansion projects and just recently in 2016 completed an expansion project at its tank railcar manufacturing facility, which enables it to perform retrofit and repair work in addition to the manufacturing work already performed there. Also during 2015, our Railcar segment began production of its newly designed tank railcars that satisfy the May 2015 regulations. Our Railcar segment's continuous commitment to quality and its efforts to increase flexibility at its tank railcar manufacturing facility allows it to build these designs efficiently and cost\neffectively. Our Railcar segment cannot assure you any increased repair capacity or manufacturing flexibility will be sufficient or necessary to meet the demands of the industry.\nRailcar shipments for the year ended December 31, 2015 were approximately 8,900 railcars, including approximately 5,060 railcars to leasing customers, as compared to 7,970 railcars for the prior year, of which approximately 5,230 railcars were to leasing customers. (Shipments of railcars for lease are included in manufacturing operations' net sales in the table above however they are eliminated from net sales in consolidation as they represent shipments to ARI's leasing business and ARL.)\nAs of December 31, 2015, our Railcar segment had a backlog of approximately 7,080 railcars, including approximately 1,450 railcars for lease customers as compared to a backlog of approximately 11,730 railcars as of December 31, 2014, including approximately 4,910 railcars for lease customers.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nTotal manufacturing revenues, before elimination of railcar sales to our Railcar segment's leasing operations, for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $1 million as compared to the corresponding prior year period. Although there was a higher volume of shipments in 2015 compared to 2014, there was a higher mix of hopper railcars in 2015, which generally sell at lower prices than tank railcars due to less material and labor content. Manufacturing revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 include revenues of $579 million relating to railcars built for our Railcar segment's leasing operations, compared to $641 million for the comparable prior year period.\nGross margin from manufacturing operations, before eliminations relating to railcar sales to our Railcar segment's leasing operations, for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased to $249 million from $271 million for the comparable prior year period. Gross margin from manufacturing operations as a percentage of manufacturing revenues decreased to 24% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 27% for the comparable prior year period. The decrease in gross margin over the respective periods was due to a higher mix of hopper railcar shipments, which generally sell at lower prices than tank railcars due to less material and labor content.\nRailcar leasing revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period due to an increase in number of railcars leased to customers as lease rates were relatively flat compared to 2014. Total railcars on lease at the end of 2015 were approximately 45,050 as compared to approximately 39,700 at the end of 2014.\nRailcar services revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period primarily due to an increase in demand, a favorable change in mix of work at our Railcar segment's repair facilities and the additional capacity resulting from expansion projects during 2015.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nTotal manufacturing revenues, before elimination of railcar sales to our Railcar segment's leasing operations, for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $156 million (18%) over the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to increased hopper railcar shipments and strong market conditions for tank railcars. Manufacturing revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 included revenues of $641 million relating to railcars built for our Railcar segment's leasing operations, compared to $456 million for the comparable prior year period.\nGross margin from manufacturing operations, before eliminations relating to railcar sales to our Railcar segment's leasing operations, for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $271 million compared to $197 million for the comparable prior year period. Gross margin from manufacturing operations as a percentage of manufacturing revenues increased to 27% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 23% for the comparable prior year period. The improved margin was primarily due to ramped up production at our Railcar segment's hopper railcar manufacturing facility that created operating efficiencies and leveraged overhead costs. This was in addition to efficiencies that our Railcar segment continued to generate at its tank railcar manufacturing facility due to high production volumes.\nRailcar leasing revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year period due to an increase in number of railcars leased to customers and an increase in the average lease rate. Total railcars on lease at the end of 2014 were approximately 39,700 as compared to approximately 34,700 at the end of 2013.\nRailcar services revenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared the corresponding prior year period primarily due to certain repair projects being performed at our Railcar segment's hopper railcar manufacturing facility during 2013 that did not continue into 2014. In 2014, production of hopper railcars ramped up due to increased demand, thus these repair projects were no longer being performed at our Railcar segment's manufacturing facilities.\nOther Segments\nGaming\nTropicana's Annual Report on Form 10-K contains a detailed description of its business, products, industry, operating strategy and associated risks. Tropicana's filings with the SEC are available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.\nCurrent economic conditions continue to adversely impact Tropicana and the gaming industry as a whole. Tropicana believes its guests have reduced their discretionary spending as a result of uncertainty and instability relating to employment and the investment and housing markets. While general economic conditions have modestly improved, we cannot assure that they will continue to improve or will not worsen in the future.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nCasino revenues are one of Tropicana's main performance indicators and account for a significant portion of its net revenues. The increase in casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period was primarily due to an increase in consolidated gaming volumes of 3.8%, primarily due to the Lumi\u00e8re acquisition on April 1, 2014, coupled with higher gaming volumes at Tropicana Casino and Resort, Atlantic City (\"Tropicana AC\"). Tropicana's slot hold percentage was 9.6% and 9.5% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Tropicana's table game hold percentage was 16.8% and 17.6% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nNet revenues from Tropicana AC comprised approximately 40% of our Gaming segment's net revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Net revenue for Tropicana AC increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period primarily due to increased customer volumes due, in part, to the closure of four competitors in Atlantic City in 2014. Based on market data, the Atlantic City market experienced year-over-year declines in casino revenue of 6.5% in the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year period; however, a comparison of year-over-year results for the remaining eight properties shows a 3.1% increase in total casino revenue in 2015 as compared to 2014. In addition, Tropicana AC casino revenues increased due to an increase in Internet gaming, coupled with 3.6% higher slot volumes, a 7.7% increase in table games volumes and a 9.4% decrease in the amount of promotional slot play redeemed, partially offset by a 1.1 percentage point decrease in the table hold percentage for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014.\nRevenues from rooms increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period, primarily due to the acquisition of Lumi\u00e8re in April 2014, coupled with higher occupancy and average daily room rate at Tropicana AC, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from rooms as a result of the sale of the River Palms property in 2014. The average daily room rate and occupancy rate across all of Tropicana's gaming properties were $85 and 70%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $79 and 66%, respectively, for the comparable prior year period.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nCasino revenues are one of Tropicana's main performance indicators and account for a significant portion of its net revenues. The increase in casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the comparable prior year period was primarily due to an increase in consolidated gaming volumes of 25.9%, primarily due to the Lumi\u00e8re acquisition on April 1, 2014, coupled with higher gaming volumes at Tropicana AC. Tropicana's slot hold percentage was 9.5% and 9.4% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Tropicana's table game hold percentage was 17.6% and 14.2% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nNet revenues from Tropicana AC comprise approximately 40% and 43% of our Gaming segment's net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Tropicana AC casino revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year period as a result of increased customer volumes due, in part, to the closure of one of Tropicana AC's competitors in Atlantic City in January 2014. In addition, during the third quarter of 2014, three additional competitors ceased operations in Atlantic City. Based on market data, the Atlantic City market experienced year-over-year decline in casino win of 8.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, Tropicana AC casino revenues increased primarily due to 17.9% higher slot volumes and 4.3 percentage point increase in the table game hold percentage, partially offset by 16.0% lower table game volumes, including lower volumes of high-end play for the year ended December 31, 2014. Internet gaming, which commenced in November 2013, also contributed to the increase in casino revenues.\nRevenues from rooms increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year period, primarily due to the acquisition of Lumi\u00e8re in April 2014. The average daily room rate and occupancy rate across all of Tropicana's gaming properties were $79 and 66%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $69 and 60%, respectively, for the comparable prior year period.\nMining\nAs discussed in Note 3, \"Operating Units - Mining,\" to the consolidated financial statements, we obtained control, and consolidated, the results of Ferrous Resources Limited (\"Ferrous Resources\") during the second quarter of 2015. Ferrous Resources represents our Mining segment.\nFerrous Resources' performance driver has historically been demand for raw materials from Chinese steelmakers. However, for the period June 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, our Mining segment has been concentrating on sales in its domestic market, Brazil, where the best margins are being captured. During the fourth quarter of 2015, both domestic and global steel industries continued to show weakness as steel mills' utilization rates failed to recover and iron ore prices remained weak.\nNet sales and cost of goods sold for the period June 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015 were $30 million and $38 million, respectively.\nDuring the period June 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, our Mining segment sold approximately 2 million metric tons of iron, of which approximately 1.8 million metric tons were sold to a single customer, a Brazilian multinational diversified metals and mining corporation and one of the largest logistics operators in Brazil. The average sales price for the period June 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015 was $17.25 per metric ton. Our Mining segment continues to evaluate the best alternatives to sell its products in light of the challenging markets for iron ore.\nFood Packaging\nOur Food Packaging segment is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates. In addition to those markets in which Viskase prices its products in U.S. dollars, it prices its products in certain of its foreign operations in euros and Brazilian reals. As a result, a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies of profitable foreign subsidiaries can have a favorable effect on Viskase's profitability. Conversely, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currencies of profitable foreign subsidiaries can have a negative effect on the profitability of our Food Packaging segment.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $21 million (6%) compared to the corresponding prior year period. The decrease in net sales was due to unfavorable foreign currency translation of $27 million, unfavorable country mix of $5 million due to sales in countries that have lower average selling price than the global sales prices, offset in part by an increase in sales volume of $11 million.\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $12 million (4%) as compared to the prior year. The decrease in cost of goods sold was due to foreign currency translation, lower raw material costs and plant efficiencies, offset in part by higher sales volumes and higher pension expense. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 24% and 25% for 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased by $6 million (2%) compared to the prior year. The decrease in net sales was due to $4 million attributable to sales volume and $2 million attributable to foreign currency translation.\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased by $10 million (4%) as compared to the prior year. While cost of goods sold decreased primarily due to lower sales volume, gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 25% and 23% for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The improvement in the gross margin as a percent of net sales over the comparable period was due to improved plant performance.\nReal Estate\nReal Estate revenues and expenses include results from club operations, sales of residential units, and rental income and expenses, including income from financing leases. Sales of residential units are included in net sales in our consolidated financial statements. Results from club and rental operations, including financing lease income, are included in other revenues from operations in our consolidated financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold 14 commercial rental properties and Oak Harbor development and operations (which historically was operated as part of Grand Harbor), recognizing an aggregate gain of $40 million which is included in other income, net in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRevenues from our real estate operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are substantially derived from our club and rental operations, including the gain on sale of various properties previously leased to others. Revenues from sales of residential units in our real estate development operations represent 11% and 15% of total Real Estate revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nRevenues from our real estate operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 are substantially derived from our club and rental operations. Revenues from sales of residential units in our real estate development operations represent 15% and less than 5% of total Real Estate revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nHome Fashion\nThe business of WestPoint Home LLC (\"WPH\") is significantly influenced by the overall economic environment, including consumer spending, at the retail level, for home textile products. Many of the larger retailers are customers of WPH. WPH will continue to realign its manufacturing operations and streamline its merchandising, sales and customer service divisions to improve its cost structure and better serve its customers. Given the uncertainty and volatility in the macroeconomic conditions, we cannot predict if WPH's financial performance will continue to improve.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nNet sales for 2015 increased by $17 million (10%) compared to 2014.

In addition, there were unrealized losses related to other securities held by the Holding Company.\nOther Consolidated Results of Operations\nOther Income, Net\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nOur consolidated other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $75 million and $182 million, respectively. Equity earnings from non-consolidated affiliates, primarily from our Automotive segment, were $62 million and $50 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, our Energy segment recorded (loss) gains on certain derivative contracts of $(29) million and $186 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

The increase was primarily due to an increase of $70 million from our Investment segment was largely attributable to higher compensation expense related to certain investment related performance, an increase of $176 million from our Automotive segment primarily due to the inclusion of the acquisition of Affinia Group Inc., the acquisition of certain business assets of Honeywell International Inc., and the IEH Auto acquisition, an increase of $11 million from our Gaming segment primarily due to the inclusion of the Lumi\u00e8re acquisition, and an increase of $12 million from our Mining segment primarily due to the inclusion of the acquisition of Ferrous Resources effective June 1, 2015. In addition, there was a a net increase in our other segments and Holding Company of $14 million.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nOur consolidated SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $208 million (15%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $89 million from our Gaming segment primarily due to inclusion of the Lumi\u00e8re acquisition during the second quarter of 2014, $76 million from our Automotive segment primarily due to the recognition of an OPEB curtailment gain during the second quarter of 2013 (which reduced SG&A in 2013), and the inclusion of the Affinia and Honeywell acquisitions during the second quarter and third quarter of 2014, respectively, and an increase of $48 million from our Investment segment due to higher compensation expense attributable to a certain fund performance.\nRestructuring\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nOur consolidated restructuring costs were $97 million and $84 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which were primarily attributable to our Automotive segment in each of the respective periods as discussed below.\nFederal-Mogul has approved and initiated restructuring activities as a part of a broader initiative to improve operating performance and reduce costs. As such, Federal-Mogul will continue to evaluate its activities and opportunities to align its business with its executive management's strategy. Restructuring expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily related to EMEA locations and aimed to reduce production complexities and reducing inefficiencies in indirect and fixed cost structures. Federal-Mogul expects to complete these programs in 2017 and incur additional restructuring charges of approximately $10 million. For programs previously initiated, Federal-Mogul expects to complete these programs in 2018 and incur additional restructuring charges of approximately $10 million.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nOur consolidated restructuring costs were $84 million and $50 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which were primarily attributable to our Automotive segment in each of the respective periods as discussed below.\nImpairment\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nOur consolidated impairment for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $653 million (484%) as compared to the corresponding prior year period. The increase was primarily due to impairment of goodwill by our Automotive and Energy segments of $312 million and $253 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2015. See Note 6, \"Fair Value Measurements,\" and Note 8, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net - Energy,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nOur consolidated impairment for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $119 million (744%) as compared to the corresponding prior year period. The increase was primarily due to impairment of goodwill by our Energy segment of $103 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. See Note 6, \"Fair Value Measurements,\" and Note 8, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net - Energy,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nInterest Expense\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nConsolidated interest expense for Icahn Enterprises increased by $307 million (36%) during 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period. The increase for Icahn Enterprises Holdings was $307 million (36%). The increases were primarily due to higher interest expense from our Investment segment attributable to due to broker balances, higher interest expense from our Automotive segment due to higher outstanding debt balances on its revolver facility coupled with higher interest rates following the refinancing of its term loans and higher interest expense from our Railcar segments due to higher outstanding debt balances.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nConsolidated interest expense for Icahn Enterprises increased by $287 million (51%) as compared to the corresponding prior year period. The increase for Icahn Enterprises Holdings was $286 million (51%). The increases were primarily due to higher interest expense from our Investment segment attributable to due to broker balances, higher interest expense from our Automotive segment due to refinancing of its term loans in April 2014, higher interest expense from our Railcar segment due to higher debt balances, offset in part by lower interest expense from our Energy segment due to overall lower interest rate on outstanding debt balances and higher capitalized interest, lower interest expense from our Food Packaging segment due to lower interest rates on outstanding debt balances and lower interest on debt refinancing from the Holding Company during the first quarter of 2014.\nIncome Tax Expense\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nFor 2015, Icahn Enterprises recorded an income tax expense of $68 million on pre-tax loss of $2.1 billion compared to an income tax benefit of $103 million on pre-tax loss of $632 million for 2014. Icahn Enterprises' effective income tax rate was (3.3)% and 16.3% for 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nFor 2015, Icahn Enterprises Holdings recorded an income tax expense of $68 million on pre-tax loss of $2.1 billion compared to an income tax benefit of $103 million on pre-tax loss of $631 million for 2014. Icahn Enterprises Holdings effective income tax rate was (3.3)% and 16.3% for 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe difference between the effective tax rate and statutory federal rate of 35% was principally due to partnership losses not subject to taxation.\nFor 2014, Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings recognized a deferred tax benefit on its pre-tax loss primarily due to income tax benefits recorded on a release of valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets in our Gaming segment of $196 million.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nFor 2014, Icahn Enterprises recorded an income tax benefit of $103 million on pre-tax loss of $632 million compared to an income tax benefit of $118 million on pre-tax income of approximately $2.3 billion for 2013. Icahn Enterprises' effective income tax rate was 16.3% and 5.1% for 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nFor 2014, Icahn Enterprises Holdings recorded an income tax benefit of $103 million on pre-tax loss of $631 million compared to an income tax benefit of $118 million on pre-tax income of approximately $2.3 billion for 2013. Icahn Enterprises Holdings' effective income tax rate was 16.3% and (5.1)% for 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nThe difference between the effective tax rate and statutory federal rate of 35% was principally due to changes in valuation allowances and partnership income not subject to taxation, as such taxes are the responsibility of the partners.\nFor 2014, Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings recognized a deferred tax benefit on its pre-tax loss primarily due to income tax benefits recorded on a release of valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets in our Gaming segment of $196 million.\nOur Gaming segment has federal net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards pursuant to the purchase of Adamar of New Jersey, Inc. ( Adamar\u201d). Internal Revenue Code Section 382 ( Code 382\u201d) places certain limitations on the annual amount of NOL carryforwards that can be utilized when a change of ownership occurs. Our Gaming segment believes its purchase of Adamar was a change in ownership pursuant to Code 382. As a result of the annual limitation, the NOL carryforward amount available to be used in future periods was $161 million and will begin to expire in the year 2028 and forward. As of March 8, 2010, Tropicana had various net deferred tax assets made up primarily of the expected future tax benefit of net operating loss carryforwards and excess tax basis not yet deductible for tax purposes. A valuation allowance was provided in full against these net deferred tax assets upon emergence from bankruptcy. During the year ended December 31, 2014, our Gaming segment reversed the valuation allowance related to the net deferred tax assets by $196 million. The reduction in the valuation allowance was a result of our Gaming segment analyzing all positive and negative evidence and concluding that it was more likely than not to realize the benefit of this portion of its net deferred tax assets. The reduction in the valuation allowance was recorded as an income tax benefit during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nHolding Company\nAs of December 31, 2015, our Holding Company had investments in the Investment Funds with a total fair market value of approximately $3.4 billion. As of December 31, 2015, our Holding Company had cash and cash equivalents of $166 million and total debt of approximately $5.5 billion.\nWe are a holding company. Our cash flow and our ability to meet our debt service obligations and make distributions with respect to depositary units likely will depend on the cash flow resulting from divestitures, equity and debt financings, interest income, returns on our interests in the Investment Funds and the payment of funds to us by our subsidiaries in the form of loans, dividends and distributions. We may pursue various means to raise cash from our subsidiaries. To date, such means include receipt of dividends and distributions from subsidiaries, obtaining loans or other financings based on the asset values of subsidiaries, or selling debt or equity securities of subsidiaries through capital markets transactions. To the degree any distributions and transfers are impaired or prohibited, our ability to make payments on our debt or distributions on our depositary units could be limited. The operating results of our subsidiaries may not be sufficient for them to make distributions to us. In addition, our subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to us, and distributions and intercompany transfers from our subsidiaries to us may be restricted by applicable law or covenants contained in debt agreements and other agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2015, based on covenants in the indenture governing our senior notes, we are unable to incur additional indebtedness. See Note 10, Debt,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning credit facilities for us and our subsidiaries.\nCVR Dividends and CVR Refining Distributions\nOn January 24, 2013, the board of directors of CVR adopted a quarterly cash dividend policy. CVR began paying regular quarterly dividends in the second quarter of 2013. Dividends are subject to change at the discretion of CVR's board of directors and may change from quarter to quarter. In addition, the current policy of the respective board of directors of CVR Refining and CVR Partners is to distribute all of the respective available cash of CVR Refining and CVR Partners each quarter. CVR Refining and CVR Partners do not have a legal obligation to pay distributions and there is no guarantee that they will pay any distributions on the units in any quarter.\nAs we currently own approximately 82.0% of the common shares of CVR, the majority of CVR's dividend will directly upstream to us. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we received an aggregate of $161 million and $374 million, respectively, in dividends from CVR and distributions from CVR Refining. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, CVR declared a quarterly dividend which will result in an additional $36 million in dividends paid to us in the first quarter of 2016.\nDistributions on Depositary Units\nOn February 11, 2013, we announced that the board of directors of our general partner approved a modification to our distribution policy to provide for an increase in the annual distribution from $1.40, comprised of $0.40 in cash and $1.00 in depositary units, to $4.00 per depositary unit, payable in either cash or additional depositary units, at the election of each\ndepositary unitholder. On May 29, 2013, the board of directors of our general partner further modified our distribution policy to increase our annual distribution from $4.00 per depositary unit to $5.00 per depositary unit. Further, on March 3, 2014, the board of directors of our general partner announced an increase in our annualized distribution from $5.00 per depositary unit to $6.00 per depositary unit.\nOn February 23, 2016, the board of directors of the general partner of Icahn Enterprises declared a quarterly distribution in the amount of $1.50 per depositary unit, which will be paid on or about April 12, 2016 to depositary unitholders of record at the close of business on March 7, 2016. Depositary unitholders will have until March, 31 2016 to make an election to receive either cash or additional depositary units; if a holder does not make an election, it will automatically be deemed to have elected to receive the dividend in cash. Depositary unitholders who elect to receive additional depositary units will receive units valued at the volume weighted average trading price of the units on NASDAQ during the 5 consecutive trading days ending April 7, 2016. No fractional depositary units will be issued pursuant to the distribution payment. Icahn Enterprises will make a cash payment in lieu of issuing fractional depositary units to any holders electing to receive depositary units. Any holders that would only be eligible to receive a fraction of a depositary unit based on the above calculation will receive a cash payment.\nDuring 2015, we declared four quarterly distributions aggregating $6.00 per depositary unit. Depositary unitholders were given the option to make an election to receive the distributions in either cash or additional depositary units; if a holder did not make an election, it was automatically deemed to have elected to receive the distributions in cash. All four distributions declared in 2015 were paid in 2015. As a result of the above declared distributions, during 2015 we distributed an aggregate 8,337,645 of Icahn Enterprises' depositary units to those Depositary unitholders who elected to receive such distributions in additional depositary units. Additionally, during 2015 we paid $114 million to those Depositary unitholders who had elected to receive such distributions in cash.\nDuring 2015, Mr. Icahn and his affiliates elected to receive a majority of their proportionate share of these distributions in depositary units. Mr. Icahn and his affiliates owned approximately 89.0% of Icahn Enterprises' outstanding depositary units as of December 31, 2015. Mr. Icahn and his affiliates have indicated that it is their present intention to elect to continue to receive the increase in Icahn Enterprises' cash distribution in additional depositary units for the foreseeable future.\nThe declaration and payment of distributions is reviewed quarterly by Icahn Enterprises GP's board of directors based upon a review of our balance sheet and cash flow, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities, our expected capital and liquidity requirements, the provisions of our partnership agreement and provisions in our financing arrangements governing distributions, and keeping in mind that limited partners subject to U.S. federal income tax have recognized income on our earnings even if they do not receive distributions that could be used to satisfy any resulting tax obligations. The payment of future distributions will be determined by the board of directors quarterly, based upon the factors described above and other factors that it deems relevant at the time that declaration of a distribution is considered. Payments of distributions are subject to certain restrictions, including certain restrictions on our subsidiaries which limit their ability to distribute dividends to us. There can be no assurance as to whether or in what amounts any future distributions might be paid.\nBorrowings\nDebt consists of the following: Table 202: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Icahn Enterprises\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2022 - Icahn Enterprises/Icahn Enterprises Holdings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.00% senior unsecured notes due 2020 - Icahn Enterprises/Icahn Enterprises Holdings\n</td> <td>1,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4.875% senior unsecured notes due 2019 - Icahn Enterprises/Icahn Enterprises Holdings\n</td> <td>1,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3.50% senior unsecured notes due 2017 - Icahn Enterprises/Icahn Enterprises Holdings\n</td> <td>1,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt facilities - Automotive\n</td> <td>2,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt facilities - Energy\n</td> <td>625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>625\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt and credit facilities - Railcar\n</td> <td>2,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit facilities - Gaming\n</td> <td>292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>295\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit facilities - Food Packaging\n</td> <td>270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>272\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>193\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 10, Debt,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report for additional information concerning terms, restrictions and covenants of our debt.

PSC Metals and Federal-Mogul have estimated their liability to remediate these sites to be $29 million and $14 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015. Additionally, Federal-Mogul has identified sites with contractual obligations and sites that are closed or expected to be closed\nand sold in connection with its restructuring activities and has accrued $16 million as of December 31, 2015, primarily related to removing hazardous materials in buildings. For further discussion regarding these commitments, among others, see Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\nAs discussed in Note 5, Investments and Related Matters,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements, we have contractual liabilities of $794 million related to securities sold, not yet purchased as of December 31, 2015. This amount has not been included in the table above as maturity is not subject to a contract and cannot be properly estimated.\nAs further discussed below, in February 2016, ARI repaid amounts outstanding under the ARI Revolving Loans (as defined below) in full or $100 million. The contractual commitment table above excludes this transaction.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have off-balance sheet risk related to investment activities associated with certain financial instruments, including futures, options, credit default swaps and securities sold, not yet purchased. For additional information regarding these arrangements, refer to Note 7, Financial Instruments,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report.\nConsolidated Cash Flows\nThe following table summarizes cash flow information for the year ended December 31, 2015 and cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2015 for each of Icahn Enterprises' operating segments and the Holding Company:\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net Cash (Used In) Provided By\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cash and Cash Equivalents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Operating Activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investing Activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Financing Activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(136\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Automotive\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(804\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>201\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy\n</td> <td>504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(151\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(214\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>765\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Metals\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Railcar\n</td> <td>381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(506\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>623\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gaming\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(83\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>217\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mining\n</td> <td>(29\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Food Packaging\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real Estate\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home Fashion\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Holding Company\n</td> <td>(270\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(827\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(116\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,351\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>826\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe consolidated cash flows of Icahn Enterprises Holdings and Icahn Enterprises are substantially the same. The minor differences between Icahn Enterprises Holdings' and Icahn Enterprises' consolidated statements of cash flows primarily relate to non-cash charges for interest expense which is presented in net cash flows used in operating activities. Therefore, we discuss only the consolidated cash flows of Icahn Enterprises below.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for 2015 of $714 million was primarily attributable to our Energy, Railcar and Gaming segments, offset in part by net cash used in operating activities attributable to our Investment segment and the Holding Company. Our Energy, Railcar and Gaming segments net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to earnings after adjusting for non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization and impairment.\nOur Investment segment had net cash used in operating activities of $136 million primarily relating to its investment transactions. Additionally, our Holding Company had net cash used in operating activities of $270 million primarily due to payments of interest expense on its debt.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for 2015 was primarily due to consolidated capital expenditures incurred by our subsidiaries and acquisitions of business. Our Railcar segment had capital expenditures of $522 million, of which $484 million was for the manufacturing or purchase of railcars for its leasing operations. Additionally, our Automotive and Energy segments had capital expenditures of $449 million and $219 million, respectively.\nAdditionally, during 2015 we acquired certain businesses within our Automotive segment as well as acquired Ferrous Resources, which constitutes our Mining segment. Also, during 2015 our Holding Company purchased certain investments, including a non-controlling interest in Pep Boys, as discussed earlier, and which we subsequently acquired the entire company in February 2016. See Note 3, \"Operating Units - Automotive,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding thesse acquisition.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for 2015 was primarily attributable to certain debt refinancing and draw down on revolver facilities at our Railcar and Automotive segments, resulting in approximately $1.0 billion in net proceeds. Additionally, our Investment segment had capital contributions of $276 million from affiliates of Mr. Icahn.\nDuring 2015, we paid dividends and distributions of $252 million to non-controlling interests in certain of our subsidiaries within our Energy and Railcar segments, as well as aggregate distributions to our general partner and LP unitholders of $116 million.\nDiscussion of Segment Liquidity and Capital Resources\nInvestment\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Investment Funds' net notional exposure was -25%. The Investment Funds' long exposure was 199% (193% long equity and 6% long credit) and the Investment Funds' short exposure was 224% (184% short equity and 40% short credit and other short exposure). The notional exposure represents the ratio of the notional exposure of the Investment Funds' invested capital to the net asset value of the Investment Funds at December 31, 2015.\nOf our long exposure of 199%, the fair value of our long positions (with certain adjustments) represented 193% of our long exposure. The notional value of our long derivative positions, which primarily included single name equity swaps and single name OTC equity forward contracts, represented 6% of our long exposure.\nOf our short exposure of 224%, the fair value of our short positions represented 11% of our short exposure. The notional value of our short derivative positions, which primarily included short broad market credit default swap contracts and short broad market index swap derivative positions, represented 213% of our short exposure.\nWith respect to both our long positions that are not notionalized (193% long) and our short positions that are not notionalized (11% short), each 1% change in exposure as a result of purchases or sales (assuming no change in value) would have a 1% impact on our cash and cash equivalents. Changes in exposure as a result of purchases and sales as well as adverse changes in market value would also have an effect on funds available to us pursuant to prime brokerage lines of credit.\nWith respect to the notional value of our short derivative swap positions (213% short exposure), our liquidity would decrease by the balance sheet unrealized loss if we were to close the positions at year end prices. This would be offset by a release of restricted cash balances collateralizing these positions as well as an increase in funds available to us pursuant to certain prime brokerage lines of credit. If we were to increase our short exposure by adding to these short positions, we would be required to provide cash collateral equal to a small percentage of the initial notional value at counterparties that require cash as collateral and then post additional collateral equal to 100% of the mark to market on adverse changes in fair value. For our counterparties who do not require cash collateral, funds available from lines of credit would decrease.\nThe Investment Funds historically have had access to significant amounts of cash available from prime brokerage lines of credit, subject to customary terms and market conditions.\nAutomotive\nFederal-Mogul\nOn April 15, 2014, Federal-Mogul entered into a tranche B term loan facility (the Tranche B Facility\u201d) and a tranche C term loan facility (the Tranche C Facility,\u201d and together with the Tranche B Facility, the Federal-Mogul Term Facilities\u201d), and assumed all of the obligations of Federal-Mogul Corporation with respect to the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolving Facility.\nThe Federal-Mogul Term Facilities, among other things, (i) provide for aggregate commitments under the Tranche B Facility of $700 million with a maturity date of April 15, 2018, (ii) provide for aggregate commitments under the Tranche C Facility of approximately $1.9 billion with a maturity date of April 15, 2021, (iii) increase the interest rates applicable to the Federal-Mogul Term Facilities, (iv) provide that for all outstanding letters of credit there is a corresponding decrease in borrowings available under the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolving Facility, (v) provide that in the event that as of a particular determination date more than $700 million aggregate principal amount of existing term loans and certain related refinancing indebtedness will become due within 91 days of such determination date, the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolving Facility will mature on such determination date, (vi) provide for additional incremental indebtedness, secured on a pari passu basis, of an unlimited amount of additional indebtedness if Federal-Mogul meets a financial covenant incurrence test, and (vii) amend certain other restrictive covenants. Pursuant to the Federal-Mogul Term Facilities, Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation assumed all of the obligations of Federal-Mogul Corporation with respect to the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolving Facility.\nSee Note 10, Debt - Automotive,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding Federal-Mogul's credit facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the borrowing availability under the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolving Facility was $170 million and $516 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, the outstanding balance on the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolving Facility was $340 million. As of December 31, 2014, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolving Facility. Federal-Mogul had $40 million and $34 million of letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, under Federal-Mogul's term loan credit facility. To the extent letters of credit are issued under the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolving Facility there will be a corresponding decrease in borrowings available under this facility.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Federal-Mogul had $194 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which $95 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") ASC 740-30-25-17 through 19, Federal-Mogul asserts that these funds are indefinitely reinvested due to operational and investing needs of the foreign locations. Furthermore, Federal-Mogul will accrue any applicable taxes in the period when it no longer intends to indefinitely reinvest these funds. Federal-Mogul would expect that the impact on cash taxes would be immaterial due to: the availability of net operation loss carryforwards and related valuation allowances; earnings considered previously taxed; and applicable tax treaties.\nFederal-Mogul's subsidiaries in Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States are party to accounts receivable factoring and securitization facilities. Gross accounts receivable transferred under these facilities were $408 million and $306 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of those gross amounts, $401 million and $293 million, respectively, qualify as sales as defined in FASB ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing. The remaining transferred receivables were pledged as collateral and accounted for as secured borrowings and recorded in the consolidated balance sheets within accounts receivable, net and debt. Proceeds from the transfers of accounts receivable qualifying as sales were $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nCertain of the facilities contain terms that require Federal-Mogul to share in the credit risk of the sold receivables. The maximum exposures to Federal-Mogul associated with certain of these facilities' terms were $11 million and $17 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nFederal-Mogul estimates its 2016 capital expenditures to be in the range of $390 million to $440 million.\nIEH Auto\nOn November 25, 2015, IEH Auto entered into a senior secured asset based revolving credit facility (the \"IEH Auto ABL Credit Facility\") for $125 million. On January 25, 2016, the ABL Credit Facility was amended and restated to increase the revolver commitments to $210 million. As of December 31, 2015, the IEH Auto ABL Facility had a balance of $75 million and $3 million in letters of credit. As of December 31, 2015, the availability on the IEH Auto ABL Credit Facility was $30 million.\nAs of December 31, 2015 IEH Auto was in compliance with the covenants of the IEH Auto ABL Facility. See Note 10, \"Debt - Automotive,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding this credit facility.\nEnergy\nAs of December 31, 2015, CVR Refining and its subsidiaries had availability under the Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility of $290 million and had letters of credit outstanding of $28 million. Availability under the Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility was limited by borrowing base conditions as of December 31, 2015. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, CVR Partners had $25 million availability under its revolving credit facility, with an uncommitted incremental facility of up to $50 million.\nOn October 23, 2012, CVR Refining LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Coffeyville Finance Inc., completed a private offering of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (the \"2022 Notes\"). The net proceeds from the offering of the 2022 Notes were used to purchase certain first lien secured notes due 2015 through a tender offer and settled redemption in the fourth quarter of 2012.\nSee Note 10, Debt - Energy,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding CVR's credit facilities, including the Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility.\nOn January 24, 2013, the board of directors of CVR adopted a quarterly cash dividend policy. CVR began paying regular quarterly dividends in the second quarter of 2013. Dividends are subject to change at the discretion of CVR's board of directors and may change from quarter to quarter. In addition, the current policy of the respective board of directors of CVR Refining and CVR Partners is to distribute all of the respective available cash of CVR Refining and CVR Partners each quarter. CVR Refining and CVR Partners do not have a legal obligation to pay distributions and there is no guarantee that they will pay any distributions on the units in any quarter.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we received an aggregate of $161 million and $374 million, respectively, in dividends from CVR and distributions from CVR Refining, including one special dividend during 2014. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, CVR declared a quarterly dividend which will result in an additional $36 million in dividends and distributions paid to us in the first quarter of 2016.\nCVR divides the petroleum business and the nitrogen fertilizer business' capital spending needs into two categories: maintenance and growth. Maintenance capital spending includes only non-discretionary maintenance projects and projects required to comply with environmental, health and safety regulations. CVR undertakes discretionary capital spending based on the expected return on incremental capital employed. Discretionary capital projects generally involve an expansion of existing capacity, improvement in product yields, and/or a reduction in direct operating expenses. Major scheduled turnaround expenses are expensed when incurred.\nCVR estimates that its aggregate capital spending in 2016 will be approximately $220 million.\nRailcar\nIn January, 2015, ARI refinanced its lease fleet financing facilities to, among other things, increase the aggregate borrowings thereunder. In connection with the refinancing, Longtrain Leasing III LLC (\"Longtrain Leasing III\") completed a private placement of $626 million in aggregate principal amount of notes consisting of $250 million in aggregate principal amount of its 2.98% fixed rate secured railcar equipment notes, Class A-1 (\"ARI Class A-1 Notes\") and $376 million in aggregate principal amount of its 4.06% fixed rate secured railcar equipment notes, Class A-2 (\"ARI Class A-2 Notes\", and collectively with the ARI Class A-1 Notes, the \"ARI 2015 Notes\"). Of the aggregate principal amount, $409 million was used to refinance ARI's lease fleet financing facilities, resulting in net proceeds of $212 million. The ARI 2015 Notes have a legal final maturity date of January 17, 2045 and an expected principal repayment date of January 15, 2025.\nIn December 2015, ARI completed a financing of its railcar lease fleet with availability of up to $200 million under a credit agreement (\"2015 ARI Credit Agreement\"). The 2015 ARI Credit Agreement contains an incremental borrowing provision under which ARI, as debtor and subject to the conditions set forth in the credit agreement, has the right but not the obligation to increase the amount of the facility in an aggregate amount of up to $100 million (the amounts extended under the 2015 ARI Credit Agreement, inclusive of any amounts extended under the incremental facility, the ARI Revolving Loans\u201d), to a maximum principal amount of $300 million. ARI may use the proceeds of the ARI Revolving Loans to finance the manufacturing of railcars on an ongoing basis, to pay related transaction costs, fees and expenses in connection with the 2015 ARI Credit Agreement, to finance ongoing working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. The initial ARI Revolving Loan obtained at closing amounted to approximately $100 million, net of fees and expenses. In February 2016,\nARI repaid amounts outstanding under the ARI Revolving Loans in full and as of the date of this Report, ARI has borrowing availability of $200 million under the ARI Revolving Loans.\nSee Note 10, \"Debt - Railcar,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding these refinancings.\nAdditionally, our Railcar segment expects its future cash flows from operations could be impacted by the state of the credit markets and the overall economy, the number of our Railcar segment's railcar orders and shipments and its production rates. Our Railcar segment's future liquidity may also be impacted by the number of new railcar orders leased versus sold.\nOur Railcar segment's current capital expenditure plans for 2016 include projects that our Railcar segment expects will expand capabilities, maintain equipment, improve efficiencies and reduce costs. Our Railcar segment also plans to increase its railcar lease fleet in 2016 to meet customer demand for leased railcars that have been ordered. Capital expenditures for 2016 are currently projected to be approximately $117 million, which includes expected additions to our Railcar segment's lease fleet of approximately $80 million.\nOn July 28, 2015, ARI's board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of its outstanding common stock (\"ARI Stock Repurchase Program\"). The ARI Stock Repurchase Program will end upon the earlier of the date on which it is terminated by ARI's board of directors or when all authorized repurchases are completed. The timing and amount of stock repurchases, if any, will be determined based upon ARI's evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The ARI Stock Repurchase Program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time and ARI has no obligation to repurchase any amount of its common stock under the ARI Stock Repurchase Program. Under the ARI Stock Repurchase Program, ARI repurchased shares of its common stock during the year ended December 31, 2015 at a cost of approximately $57 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, ARI repurchased additional shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $5 million.\nGaming\nTropicana's cash flows are and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, many of which are outside of its control, including regulatory restrictions, competition and other general business conditions. Tropicana believes that it will have sufficient liquidity through a combination of available cash, credit facilities and cash flow from its properties to fund its cash requirements and capital expenditures for its normal operating activities.\nPart of Tropicana's overall strategy includes consideration of expansion opportunities in new gaming jurisdictions, underserved markets and acquisition and other strategic opportunities that may arise periodically. Tropicana may require additional funds in order to execute on such strategic growth, and may incur additional debt or issue additional equity to finance any such transactions. We cannot assure you that Tropicana will be able to incur such debt or issue any such additional equity on acceptable terms or at all.\nIn November 2013, Tropicana entered into (i) a senior secured first lien term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $300 million, issued at a discount of 0.5% (the Term Loan Facility\u201d) and (ii) a senior secured first lien revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $15 million (the Revolving Facility\u201d and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the Credit Facilities\u201d). Commencing on December 31, 2013, the Term Loan Facility amortizes in equal quarterly installments in an amount of $750,000, with any remaining balance payable on November 27, 2020. Amounts under the Revolving Facility are available to be borrowed and re-borrowed until its termination on November 27, 2018. As of December 31, 2015, the Revolving Facility was undrawn and had $15 million of availability. See Note 10, \"Debt - Gaming\" in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the Credit Facilities.\nTropicana estimates that its aggregate capital expenditures for 2016 will be $81 million. In addition, Tropicana estimates that it will spend approximately $25 million in 2016 related to its $50 million commitment to develop a landside gaming facility at one of its properties.\nOn July 31, 2015 Tropicana's board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $50 million of its outstanding common stock with no set expiration date (\"Tropicana Stock Repurchase Program\"). The Tropicana Stock Repurchase Program will end upon the earlier of the date on which the plan is terminated by Tropicana's board of directors or when all authorized repurchases are completed. The timing and amount of stock repurchases, if any, will be determined based upon Tropicana's evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The Tropicana Stock Repurchase Program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time and Tropicana has no obligation to repurchase any amount of its common stock under the Tropicana Stock Repurchase Program. As of the date of this Report, Tropicana has not yet repurchased any shares of its common stock under the Tropicana Stock Repurchase Program.\nFood Packaging\nOn January 30, 2014, Viskase entered into a credit agreement that provided for a $275 million senior secured covenant light term loan facility ( Viskase Term Loan\u201d). The Viskase Term Loan bears interest at a LIBOR Rate plus 3.25% (with the LIBOR Rate carrying a 1.00% floor), or at a Base Rate equal to the sum of (1) the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate, (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%, (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1.0%, or (d) 2.0%, plus (2) 2.25%. The Viskase Term Loan has a 1% per annum amortization with a maturity date of January 30, 2021. See Note 10, \"Debt - Food Packaging,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding this credit facility.\nOur Food Packaging segment estimates that its capital expenditures for 2016 will be approximately $22 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Among others, estimates are used when accounting for valuation of investments and pension expense. Estimates used in determining fair value measurements include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flow assumptions, market rate assumptions for contractual obligations, actuarial assumptions for benefit plans, settlement plans for litigation and contingencies, and appropriate discount rates. Estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ from estimates.\nWe believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nValuation of Investments\nThe fair value of our investments, including securities sold, not yet purchased, is based on observable market prices when available. Securities owned by the Investment Funds that are listed on a securities exchange are valued at their last sales price on the primary securities exchange on which such securities are traded on such date. Securities that are not listed on any exchange but are traded over-the-counter are valued at the mean between the last bid\u201d and ask\u201d price for such security on such date. Securities and other instruments for which market quotes are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the applicable general partner. For some investments little market activity may exist; management's determination of fair value is then based on the best information available in the circumstances and may incorporate management's own assumptions and involves a significant degree of management's judgment.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill\nLong-lived assets held and used by our various operating segments and long-lived assets to be disposed of are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as vacancies and rejected leases and reduced production capacity, indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In performing the review for recoverability, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest charges, is less than the carrying amount of the asset an impairment loss is recognized.\nMeasurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets that we expect to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\nDefinite-lived assets held by our various segments are periodically reviewed for impairment indicators. If impairment indicators exist, we perform the required analysis and record an impairment charge as required by applicable U.S. GAAP.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, such as goodwill and trademarks, held by our various segments are reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. Goodwill impairment testing involves a two-step process. Step 1 compares the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no further analysis is necessary. The reporting unit fair value is based upon consideration of various valuation methodologies, including guideline transaction multiples, multiples of current earnings, and projected future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the risk involved. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair\nvalue, Step 2 must be completed to quantify the amount of impairment. Step 2 calculates the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, of the reporting unit, from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in Step 1. The implied fair value of goodwill determined in this step is compared to the carrying value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss, equal to the difference, is recognized.\nThe reporting unit fair values of our reporting segments are based upon consideration of various valuation methodologies, one of which is projecting future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the risks involved ( Discounted Cash Flow\u201d or DCF\u201d). Assumptions used in a DCF require the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about appropriate discount rates and terminal values, growth rates, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The forecasted cash flows are based on current plans and for years beyond that plan, the estimates are based on assumed growth rates. We believe that our assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses. The discount rates, which are intended to reflect the risks inherent in future cash flow projections, used in a DCF are based on estimates of the weighted-average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) of a market participant. Such estimates are derived from our analysis of peer companies and consider the industry weighted average return on debt and equity from a market participant perspective.\nAutomotive\nPowertrain and Motorparts are our only Automotive segment reporting units with goodwill allocated to it. While the fair value of our Automotive segment's Powertrain reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value, the Motorparts reporting unit failed \"Step 1\" of the goodwill impairment analysis. Based on \"Step 2\" of the goodwill impairment analysis of our Automotive segment's Motorparts reporting unit, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $312 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Due to the complexity in \"Step 2\" goodwill impairment test, we expect to finalize the assessment of our Automotive segment's goodwill impairment during the first quarter of 2016 and any resulting difference in the amount of the impairment will be adjusted at that time.\nAs discussed above, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $312 million for our Automotive segment's Motorparts reporting unit during the year ended December 31, 2015. As a result, there was $349 million of goodwill remaining in our Automotive segment's Motorparts reporting unit at December 31, 2015. Moreover, as a result of our recoverability analysis, there were no indications of impairment related to long-lived assets for our Automotive segment's Motorparts reporting unit.\nEnergy\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of April 30 of each year for our Energy segment, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. The first step of the impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of our Energy segment's assets to their respective carrying values to determine the potential for goodwill impairment. The second step of the impairment test, if necessary, involves quantifying the level of goodwill impairment.\nThe fair value of our Energy segment's reporting unit is based upon consideration of various valuation methodologies, including a DCF analysis and pricing multiples of current and future earnings observed for comparable public companies. Assumptions used in a DCF require the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about appropriate discount rates and terminal values, growth rates, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The forecasted cash flows are based on current plans and for years beyond that plan, and the estimates are based on assumed growth rates. We believe that our assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses. The discount rates, which are intended to reflect the risks inherent in future cash flow projections, used in a DCF are based on estimates of the weighted-average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) of a market participant. Such estimates are derived from our analysis of peer companies and consider the industry weighted average return on debt and equity from a market participant perspective.\nWe finalized the annual goodwill impairment test for our Energy segment during the third quarter of 2015. Based on the results of our annual goodwill impairment test for our Energy segment, while the fair market value of our Energy segment's Petroleum reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value, the fair market value of our Energy segment's Fertilizer reporting unit was approximately 1% in excess of its carrying value and was therefore considered at risk for failing \"Step 1\" of the goodwill impairment analysis. Based on worsening sales trends for our Energy segment's Fertilizer reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2015, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test for our Energy segment's Fertilizer reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2015. Based on this analysis, our Energy segment recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $253 million, which represented the full amount of the remaining goodwill allocated to this reporting unit. Due to the complexity in \"Step 2\" goodwill impairment test, we expect to finalize the assessment of our Energy segment's goodwill\nimpairment during the first quarter of 2016 and any resulting difference in the amount of the impairment will be adjusted at that time.\nIn connection with recording a goodwill impairment charge of $253 million, representing the full amount of the remaining goodwill allocated to our Energy segment's Fertilizer reporting unit, we also performed an impairment test for long-lived assets for our Energy segment's fertilizer business, including finite-lived intangible assets, utilizing estimates of undiscounted future cash flows based on the use of the assets for their remaining useful life for our Energy segment's fertilizer business. The impairment test did not result in the impairment of any long-lived assets for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, based on certain negative trends occurring in the energy markets, particularly with respect to the significant volatility in the oil markets as a result of a drop in forecasted worldwide demand for crude oil supply and inventories, we determined that goodwill impairment indicators existed in both of our Energy segment's Petroleum and Fertilizer reporting units. Accordingly, we performed a \"Step 1\" goodwill impairment analysis for our Energy segment's reporting units as of December 1, 2014. Our Energy segment's petroleum reporting unit passed Step 1\u201d of the goodwill impairment analysis, and therefore, we did not perform Step 2\u201d of the goodwill impairment analysis for this reporting unit. Because our Energy segment's Fertilizer reporting unit failed \"Step 1\" of the goodwill impairment analysis, we performed \"Step 2\" of the goodwill impairment analysis. Based on \"Step 2\" results of the goodwill impairment analysis, we recognized a preliminary impairment charge of $103 million for our Energy segment's Fertilizer reporting unit for the year ended December 31, 2014. Due to the complexity of the \"Step 2\" goodwill impairment test, we finalized the assessment of our Energy segment's goodwill impairment during the first quarter of 2015 and noted that no additional adjustments to goodwill were required for the first quarter of 2015.\nCommitments and Contingencies - Litigation\nOn an ongoing basis, we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us. While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions, we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, we make estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries, if any. We accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made.\nPension Plans and Other Post-employment Benefit Plans\nFederal-Mogul sponsors defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans for certain employees and retirees around the world. Federal-Mogul's defined benefit plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return, discount rate, and mortality and mortality improvement rates of plan participants.\nDifferences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations. Actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses which are subject to amortization and expensed over future periods. The unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss on Federal-Mogul's pension plans was $532 million and $590 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Federal-Mogul expects to recognize amortization expense of $15 million in 2016.\nAssumptions used to calculate benefit obligations as of the end of a fiscal year directly affect the expense to be recognized in future periods. The primary assumptions affecting our accounting for employee benefits as of December 31, 2015 are as follows:\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Long-term rate of return on plan assets: The required use of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year. While the development of the long-term rate of return on assets gives appropriate consideration to recent fund performance and historical returns, the assumption is designed to approximate a long-term prospective rate. The expected long-term rate of return used to calculate net periodic pension cost is 6.55% for U.S. plans and a weighted average of 3.52% for non-U.S. plans.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Discount rate: The discount rate reflects the effective yield on high quality fixed income securities available in the marketplace as of the measurement date to settle pension and post-employment benefit obligations. The weighted-average discount rate used to calculate net periodic pension cost is 3.85% for U.S. pension plans and a weighted\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\naverage of 1.77% for non-U.S. plans and 3.84% for its OPEB. In calculating its benefit obligations, Federal-Mogul used a weighted-average discount rate of 4.15% for its U.S. pension plans, a weighted average discount rate of 2.72% for its non-U.S. pension plans and a discount rate of 4.18% for its OPEB.\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Health care cost trend: For post-employment health care plan accounting, Federal-Mogul reviews external data and company specific historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate. The assumed health care cost trend rate used to measure next year's post-employment health care benefits is 6.97% for both health care drug costs, both declining to an ultimate trend rate of 5.00% in 2022.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Mortality Assumptions: Federal-Mogul has reviewed the mortality improvement tables published by the Society of Actuaries in the three months ended December 31, 2015 and determined its current assumptions are appropriate to measure its U.S. pension plans' benefit obligations as of December 31, 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations. The effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to expense over future periods. The unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss on Federal-Mogul's pension plans was $587 million and $685 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The change is due primarily to the increase in discount rates partially offset by actual asset returns being less than assumed returns.\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for projected benefit obligations ( PBO\u201d), associated expense and other comprehensive loss. The changes in these assumptions have no impact on Federal-Mogul's funding requirements.\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Pension Benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other Post-Employment Benefits\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>United States Plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-U.S. Plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Change in 2016 expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\nin\nPBO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in 2016 expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\nin\nPBO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in 2016 expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\nin\nPBO\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>25 bp decrease in discount rate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>25 bp increase in discount rate\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>25 bp decrease in return on assets rate\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>25 bp increase in return on assets rate\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe assumed health care trend rate has a significant impact on the amounts reported for non-pension plans.

Certain of our operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning discharges to the air, soil, surface and subsurface waters and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials and hazardous substances. Certain of our operations are also subject to other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations including those that require them to remove or mitigate the effects of the disposal or release of certain materials at\nvarious sites. While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions, if any, management uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that it will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, management makes estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries, if any. Certain of our operations accrue a liability when their management believes a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that have previously been made.\nIt is impossible to predict precisely what effect these laws and regulations will have on our operations in the future. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may result in, among other things, capital expenditures, costs and liabilities. Management believes, based on past experience and its best assessment of future events, that these environmental liabilities and costs will be assessed and paid over an extended period of time. Management believes that recorded environmental liabilities will be adequate to cover estimated liability for exposure in respect to such matters. In the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded, our results of operations could be materially affected.\nAutomotive\nFederal-Mogul is a defendant in lawsuits filed, or the recipient of administrative orders issued or demand letters received, in various jurisdictions pursuant to the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ( CERCLA\u201d) or other similar national, provincial or state environmental remedial laws. These laws provide that responsible parties may be liable to pay for remediating contamination resulting from hazardous substances that were discharged into the environment by them, by prior owners or occupants of property they currently own or operate, or by others to whom they sent such substances for treatment or other disposition at third party locations. Federal-Mogul has been notified by the EPA, other national environmental agencies, and various provincial and state agencies that it may be a potentially responsible party ( PRP\u201d) under such laws for the cost of remediating hazardous substances pursuant to CERCLA and other national and state or provincial environmental laws. PRP designation often results in the funding of site investigations and subsequent remedial activities.\nMany of the sites that are likely to be the costliest to remediate are often current or former commercial waste disposal facilities to which numerous companies sent wastes. Despite the potential joint and several liability which might be imposed on Federal-Mogul under CERCLA and some of the other laws pertaining to these sites, its share of the total waste sent to these sites has generally been small. Federal-Mogul believes its exposure for liability at these sites is limited.\nFederal-Mogul has also identified certain other present and former properties at which it may be responsible for cleaning up or addressing environmental contamination, in some cases as a result of contractual commitments and/or federal or state environmental laws. Federal-Mogul is actively seeking to resolve these actual and potential statutory, regulatory and contractual obligations. Although difficult to quantify based on the complexity of the issues, Federal-Mogul has accrued amounts corresponding to its best estimate of the costs associated with such regulatory and contractual obligations on the basis of available information from site investigations and best professional judgment of consultants.\nTotal environmental liabilities, determined on an undiscounted basis, were $14 million and $15 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\nFederal-Mogul believes that recorded environmental liabilities will be adequate to cover its estimated liability for its exposure in respect of such matters. In the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded by Federal-Mogul, our Automotive segment's results of operations could be materially affected. At December 31, 2015, Federal-Mogul estimates reasonably possible material additional losses, above and beyond its best estimate of required remediation costs as recorded, to approximate $44 million.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nFederal-Mogul has identified sites with contractual obligations and several sites that are closed or expected to be closed and sold. In connection with these sites, Federal-Mogul has accrued $16 million and $24 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for ARO's, primarily related to anticipated costs of removing hazardous building materials at its facilities, and has considered impairment issues that may result from capitalization of these ARO amounts.\nFederal-Mogul has conditional asset retirement obligations (\"CARO\"), primarily related to removal costs of hazardous materials in buildings, for which it believes reasonable cost estimates cannot be made at this time because it does not believe it has a reasonable basis to assign probabilities to a range of potential settlement dates for these retirement obligations. Accordingly, Federal-Mogul is currently unable to determine amounts to accrue for CARO at such sites.\nIncome Taxes\nExcept as described below, no provision has been made for federal, state, local or foreign income taxes on the results of operations generated by partnership activities as such taxes are the responsibility of the partners. Our corporate subsidiaries account for their income taxes under the asset and liability method.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nFederal-Mogul and Viskase did not record taxes on its undistributed earnings of $879 million and $66 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015, since these earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. If at some future date, these earnings cease to be permanently reinvested, Federal-Mogul and Viskase may be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on such amounts. Determining the unrecognized deferred tax liability on the potential distribution of these earnings is not practicable as such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing when remittance occurs.\nManagement periodically evaluates all evidence, both positive and negative, in determining whether a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets is still needed. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, we concluded, based on the projections of taxable income, that certain of our corporate subsidiaries more likely than not will realize a partial benefit from their deferred tax assets and loss carry forwards. Ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon, among other factors, our corporate subsidiaries' ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward periods and is subject to change depending on the tax laws in effect in the years in which the carryforwards are used. See Note 14, \"Income Taxes,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the reversal of our Gaming segment's deferred tax assets during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDerivative Instruments\nEnergy\nOur Energy segment's petroleum business uses futures contracts, options, and forward contracts primarily to reduce exposure to changes in crude oil prices and finished goods product prices to provide economic hedges of inventory positions. Although management considers these derivatives economic hedges, these derivative instruments do not qualify as hedges for hedge accounting purposes under FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (\"FASB ASC 815\"), and accordingly are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded in earnings as a component of other income, net in the period of change. The estimated fair values of forward and swap contracts are based on quoted market prices and assumptions for the estimated forward yield curves of related commodities in periods when quoted market prices are unavailable.\nOur Energy segment's nitrogen fertilizer business uses forward swap contracts primarily to reduce the exposure to changes in interest rates on its debt and to provide a cash flow hedge. These derivative instruments have been designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Accordingly, these instruments are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets at each reporting period end. The actual measurement of the cash flow hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings, if applicable. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the swaps is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in accordance with FASB ASC 815.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Updates\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, creating a new topic, FASB ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, superseding revenue recognition requirements in FASB ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. This ASU requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, an entity is required to disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. This ASU was amended by ASU No. 2015-14, issued in August 2015, which deferred the original effective date by one year; the effective date of this ASU is for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, using one of two retrospective application methods. Early adoption is permitted only as of the annual reporting periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and disclosures.\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, which amends FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. This ASU requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in FASB ASC Topic 718 as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. We believe that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and disclosures.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, which amends FASB ASC Topic 810, Consolidations. This ASU amends the current consolidation guidance, including introducing a separate consolidation analysis specific to limited partnerships and other similar entities. This ASU requires that limited partnerships and similar legal entities provide partners with either substantive kick-out rights or substantive participating rights over the general partner in order to be considered a voting interest entity. The specialized consolidation model and guidance for limited partnerships and similar legal entities have been eliminated. There is no longer a presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership. For limited partnerships and similar legal entities that qualify as voting interest entities, a limited partner with a controlling financial interest should consolidate a limited partnership. A controlling financial interest may be achieved through holding a limited partner interest that provides substantive kick-out rights. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We believe that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and disclosures.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which amends FASB ASC Subtopic 835-30, Interest - Imputation of Interest. The new standard requires that all costs incurred to issue debt be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the debt. Given the absence of authoritative guidance within this ASU regarding debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit, the SEC staff has stated that it would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement. The standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and is required to be applied on a retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. We expect that the adoption of this new guidance will generally result in a reclassification of debt issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheets.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-06, Effects on Historical Earnings per Unit of Master Limited Partnership Dropdown Transactions, which amends FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. This ASU requires that for purposes of calculating earnings per share under the two-class method, the earnings or losses of a transferred business before the date of a dropdown transaction should be allocated entirely to the general partner. In that circumstance, the previously reported earnings per unit of the limited partners would not change as a result of the drop down transaction. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is permitted. The adoption of this guidance will have no impact on our consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures as we have historically allocated earnings or losses of a transferred business before the date of applicable dropdown transactions to the general partner for purposes of calculating earnings per share.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which amends FASB ASC Topic 330, Inventory. This ASU requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value and eliminates the option that currently exists for measuring inventory at market value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. This ASU should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim period or annual reporting period. We anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have minimal impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and disclosures.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments, which amends FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. This ASU eliminates the requirement to retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition dates of business combinations. Rather, this ASU requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this ASU should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. We anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have minimal impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and disclosures.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which amends FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Current GAAP requires an entity to separate income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. This ASU requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We have elected to early adopt this ASU for the year ended December 31, 2015 on a prospective basis. As we do not present a classified statement of position, this ASU will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and disclosures.\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d which are not historical in nature are intended to be, and are hereby identified as, forward-looking statements\u201d for purposes of the safe harbor provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or by Public Law 104-67.\nForward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from trends, plans, or expectations set forth in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties may include the risks and uncertainties described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.", "item_7_truncated": "various sites. While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions, if any, management uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that it will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, management makes estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries, if any. Certain of our operations accrue a liability when their management believes a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that have previously been made.\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Additionally, the cost of RINs is dependent upon a variety of factors, which include the availability of RINs for purchase, the price at which RINs can be purchased, transportation fuel production levels, the mix of the petroleum business' petroleum products, as well as the fuel blending performed at its refineries and downstream terminals, all of which can vary significantly from period to period. Based upon recent market prices of RINs and current estimates related to the other variable factors, the petroleum business estimates that the total cost of RINs will be approximately $140 million to $190 million for the year ending December 31, 2016.\n \u2022 Mortality Assumptions: Federal-Mogul has reviewed the mortality improvement tables published by the Society of Actuaries in the three months ended December 31, 2015 and determined its current assumptions are appropriate to measure its U.S. pension plans' benefit obligations as of December 31, 2015.  Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations. The effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to expense over future periods. The unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss on Federal-Mogul's pension plans was $587 million and $685 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The change is due primarily to the increase in discount rates partially offset by actual asset returns being less than assumed returns.\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

Subsequent to the completion of the pending mergers as discussed below, it is estimated that CVR will hold approximately 34% of the outstanding common units of CVR Partners and 100% of the general partner interest.\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>6,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for projected benefit obligations ( PBO\u201d), associated expense and other comprehensive loss. The changes in these assumptions have no impact on Federal-Mogul's funding requirements.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, based on certain negative trends occurring in the energy markets, particularly with respect to the significant volatility in the oil markets as a result of a drop in forecasted worldwide demand for crude oil supply and inventories, we determined that goodwill impairment indicators existed in both of our Energy segment's Petroleum and Fertilizer reporting units. Accordingly, we performed a \"Step 1\" goodwill impairment analysis for our Energy segment's reporting units as of December 1, 2014. Our Energy segment's petroleum reporting unit passed Step 1\u201d of the goodwill impairment analysis, and therefore, we did not perform Step 2\u201d of the goodwill impairment analysis for this reporting unit. Because our Energy segment's Fertilizer reporting unit failed \"Step 1\" of the goodwill impairment analysis, we performed \"Step 2\" of the goodwill impairment analysis. Based on \"Step 2\" results of the goodwill impairment analysis, we recognized a preliminary impairment charge of $103 million for our Energy segment's Fertilizer reporting unit for the year ended December 31, 2014. Due to the complexity of the \"Step 2\" goodwill impairment test, we finalized the assessment of our Energy segment's goodwill impairment during the first quarter of 2015 and noted that no additional adjustments to goodwill were required for the first quarter of 2015.\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in 000s)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ferrous tons sold\n</td> <td>850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,444\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-ferrous pounds sold\n</td> <td>117,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>230,571\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDecember 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years.

We anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have minimal impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and disclosures.\nThe fertilizer business' cost of goods sold, before eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period decreased by $3 million (1%), primarily due to lower consumption of pet coke mostly due to the decrease in production during the turnaround and the Linde air separation unit related downtime, lower pet coke pricing, decreased distribution costs, freight expenses and purchased ammonia.\nDuring the period June 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, our Mining segment sold approximately 2 million metric tons of iron, of which approximately 1.8 million metric tons were sold to a single customer, a Brazilian multinational diversified metals and mining corporation and one of the largest logistics operators in Brazil. The average sales price for the period June 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015 was $17.25 per metric ton. Our Mining segment continues to evaluate the best alternatives to sell its products in light of the challenging markets for iron ore.\nCasino revenues are one of Tropicana's main performance indicators and account for a significant portion of its net revenues. The increase in casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period was primarily due to an increase in consolidated gaming volumes of 3.8%, primarily due to the Lumi\u00e8re acquisition on April 1, 2014, coupled with higher gaming volumes at Tropicana Casino and Resort, Atlantic City (\"Tropicana AC\"). Tropicana's slot hold percentage was 9.6% and 9.5% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Tropicana's table game hold percentage was 16.8% and 17.6% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments, which amends FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. This ASU eliminates the requirement to retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition dates of business combinations. Rather, this ASU requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after\nCasino revenues are one of Tropicana's main performance indicators and account for a significant portion of its net revenues. The increase in casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the comparable prior year period was primarily due to an increase in consolidated gaming volumes of 25.9%, primarily due to the Lumi\u00e8re acquisition on April 1, 2014, coupled with higher gaming volumes at Tropicana AC. Tropicana's slot hold percentage was 9.5% and 9.4% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Tropicana's table game hold percentage was 17.6% and 14.2% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nValuation of Investments\nEnergy\nOur consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $283 million (17%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $70 million from our Investment segment was largely attributable to higher compensation expense related to certain investment related performance, an increase of $176 million from our Automotive segment primarily due to the inclusion of the acquisition of Affinia Group Inc., the acquisition of certain business assets of Honeywell International Inc., and the IEH Auto acquisition, an increase of $11 million from our Gaming segment primarily due to the inclusion of the Lumi\u00e8re acquisition, and an increase of $12 million from our Mining segment primarily due to the inclusion of the acquisition of Ferrous Resources effective June 1, 2015. In addition, there was a a net increase in our other segments and Holding Company of $14 million.\nCertain of PSC Metals' and Federal-Mogul's facilities are environmentally impaired. PSC Metals and Federal-Mogul have estimated their liability to remediate these sites to be $29 million and $14 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015. Additionally, Federal-Mogul has identified sites with contractual obligations and sites that are closed or expected to be closed\nFood Packaging\nBorrowings\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Investment Funds' net notional exposure was -25%. The Investment Funds' long exposure was 199% (193% long equity and 6% long credit) and the Investment Funds' short exposure was 224% (184% short equity and 40% short credit and other short exposure). The notional exposure represents the ratio of the notional exposure of the Investment Funds' invested capital to the net asset value of the Investment Funds at December 31, 2015.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we owned 82.0% of the total outstanding common stock of CVR. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings directly owned approximately 4.0% of the total outstanding common stock of CVR Refining.\nFederal-Mogul estimates its 2016 capital expenditures to be in the range of $390 million to $440 million.\nInvestment\nFederal-Mogul operates with two end-customer focused businesses. The Powertrain business focuses on original equipment products for automotive, heavy duty and industrial applications. Powertrain operates manufacturing facilities in 19 countries and derived 35% of its 2015 OE sales in North America, 46% in Europe, the Middle-East and Africa (\"EMEA\"), and 19% in the rest of the world (\"ROW\"). The Motorparts business sells and distributes a broad portfolio of products in the global aftermarket, while also serving original equipment manufacturers with products including braking, chassis, wipers, and other vehicle components. Motorparts operates manufacturing sites in 15 countries and distribution centers and warehouses in 14 countries. Motorparts derived 56% of its sales through North America, 37% in EMEA, and 7% in ROW.\nAs of December 31, 2015, based on covenants in the indenture governing our senior notes, we are unable to incur additional indebtedness. See Note 10, Debt,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning credit facilities for us and our subsidiaries.\nThe following table summarizes total revenues, net (loss) income and net (loss) income attributable to Icahn Enterprises for each of our reporting segments and our Holding Company for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nConsolidated net sales increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 by $412 million (6%) as compared to the corresponding prior year period. Excluding dispositions of $119 million and unfavorable foreign currency impacts of $51 million, sales organically increased by $582 million or 9% on a constant dollar basis. This increase is driven by sales growth in the Powertrain business of $301 million (8%) and an increase in sales in the Motorparts business of $281 million (10%), driven by the Affinia chassis and the Honeywell brake component business acquisitions.\nThe fair value of our investments, including securities sold, not yet purchased, is based on observable market prices when available. Securities owned by the Investment Funds that are listed on a securities exchange are valued at their last sales price on the primary securities exchange on which such securities are traded on such date. Securities that are not listed on any exchange but are traded over-the-counter are valued at the mean between the last bid\u201d and ask\u201d price for such security on such date. Securities and other instruments for which market quotes are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the applicable general partner. For some investments little market activity may exist; management's determination of fair value is then based on the best information available in the circumstances and may incorporate management's own assumptions and involves a significant degree of management's judgment.\nGlobal Vehicle Sales Levels\n\nAs discussed above, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $312 million for our Automotive segment's Motorparts reporting unit during the year ended December 31, 2015. As a result, there was $349 million of goodwill remaining in our Automotive segment's Motorparts reporting unit at December 31, 2015. Moreover, as a result of our recoverability analysis, there were no indications of impairment related to long-lived assets for our Automotive segment's Motorparts reporting unit.\nDiscussion of Segment Liquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2015, our Railcar segment had a backlog of approximately 7,080 railcars, including approximately 1,450 railcars for lease customers as compared to a backlog of approximately 11,730 railcars as of December 31, 2014, including approximately 4,910 railcars for lease customers.\nThe following table summarizes cash flow information for the year ended December 31, 2015 and cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2015 for each of Icahn Enterprises' operating segments and the Holding Company:\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $375 million (6%) as compared to the corresponding prior year period. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to acquisitions.\nPension Plans and Other Post-employment Benefit Plans\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which amends FASB ASC Topic 330, Inventory. This ASU requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value and eliminates the option that currently exists for measuring inventory at market value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. This ASU should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim period or annual reporting period. We anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have minimal impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and disclosures.\nHolding Company\nEnergy\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nDecember 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and disclosures.\nOperating Activities\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $12 million (4%) as compared to the prior year. The decrease in cost of goods sold was due to foreign currency translation, lower raw material costs and plant efficiencies, offset in part by higher sales volumes and higher pension expense. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 24% and 25% for 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-06, Effects on Historical Earnings per Unit of Master Limited Partnership Dropdown Transactions, which amends FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. This ASU requires that for purposes of calculating earnings per share under the two-class method, the earnings or losses of a transferred business before the date of a dropdown transaction should be allocated entirely to the general partner. In that circumstance, the previously reported earnings per unit of the limited partners would not change as a result of the drop down transaction. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is permitted. The adoption of this guidance will have no impact on our consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures as we have historically allocated earnings or losses of a transferred business before the date of applicable dropdown transactions to the general partner for purposes of calculating earnings per share.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Federal-Mogul had $194 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which $95 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") ASC 740-30-25-17 through 19, Federal-Mogul asserts that these funds are indefinitely reinvested due to operational and investing needs of the foreign locations. Furthermore, Federal-Mogul will accrue any applicable taxes in the period when it no longer intends to indefinitely reinvest these funds. Federal-Mogul would expect that the impact on cash taxes would be immaterial due to: the availability of net operation loss carryforwards and related valuation allowances; earnings considered previously taxed; and applicable tax treaties.\nOur consolidated other income (loss), net for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $182 million and $21 million, respectively. Equity earnings from non-consolidated affiliates, primarily from our Automotive segment, were $50 million and $26 million the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition, our Energy segment recorded gains on certain derivative contracts of $186 million and $57 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Included in our consolidated other income (loss), net was a loss on extinguishment of debt of $162 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. See Note 7, \"Financial Instruments,\" and Note 16, \"Other Income, Net,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\n\nRevenues from rooms increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period, primarily due to the acquisition of Lumi\u00e8re in April 2014, coupled with higher occupancy and average daily room rate at Tropicana AC, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from rooms as a result of the sale of the River Palms property in 2014. The average daily room rate and occupancy rate across all of Tropicana's gaming properties were $85 and 70%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $79 and 66%, respectively, for the comparable prior year period.\nGlobal vehicle production increased by 1.3% in 2015. European vehicle production rose 4.1% from 2014 levels. North American vehicle production increased 3.6%, with positive growth in Mexico and the United States. Vehicle production in the Asia-Pacific region increased just under 1% in 2015, reaching another record high. Among the major regions, only South America posted a decline in 2015, down 19.3%.\nOf our short exposure of 224%, the fair value of our short positions represented 11% of our short exposure. The notional value of our short derivative positions, which primarily included short broad market credit default swap contracts and short broad market index swap derivative positions, represented 213% of our short exposure.\nGross margin from manufacturing operations, before eliminations relating to railcar sales to our Railcar segment's leasing operations, for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased to $249 million from $271 million for the comparable prior year period. Gross margin from manufacturing operations as a percentage of manufacturing revenues decreased to 24% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 27% for the comparable prior year period. The decrease in gross margin over the respective periods was due to a higher mix of hopper railcar shipments, which generally sell at lower prices than tank railcars due to less material and labor content.\nThe strength of the aftermarket business is influenced by several key drivers. These include the vehicle population (or \"parc\"), average vehicle age, fuel prices and vehicle distance traveled. The vehicle parc is estimated to have expanded in most major markets, including the United States, Japan, China, and Germany. Average vehicle ages also increased, despite growth in new vehicle sales, in most regions.\nFederal-Mogul has also identified certain other present and former properties at which it may be responsible for cleaning up or addressing environmental contamination, in some cases as a result of contractual commitments and/or federal or state environmental laws. Federal-Mogul is actively seeking to resolve these actual and potential statutory, regulatory and contractual obligations. Although difficult to quantify based on the complexity of the issues, Federal-Mogul has accrued amounts corresponding to its best estimate of the costs associated with such regulatory and contractual obligations on the basis of available information from site investigations and best professional judgment of consultants.\nHolding Company\nimpairment during the first quarter of 2016 and any resulting difference in the amount of the impairment will be adjusted at that time.\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $21 million (6%) compared to the corresponding prior year period. The decrease in net sales was due to unfavorable foreign currency translation of $27 million, unfavorable country mix of $5 million due to sales in countries that have lower average selling price than the global sales prices, offset in part by an increase in sales volume of $11 million.\nCVR estimates that its aggregate capital spending in 2016 will be approximately $220 million.\nSee Note 10, Debt - Energy,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding CVR's credit facilities, including the Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility.\nTotal manufacturing revenues, before elimination of railcar sales to our Railcar segment's leasing operations, for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $156 million (18%) over the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to increased hopper railcar shipments and strong market conditions for tank railcars. Manufacturing revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 included revenues of $641 million relating to railcars built for our Railcar segment's leasing operations, compared to $456 million for the comparable prior year period.\nThe assumed health care trend rate has a significant impact on the amounts reported for non-pension plans. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the assumed health care trend rate:\n\nRailcar services revenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared the corresponding prior year period primarily due to certain repair projects being performed at our Railcar segment's hopper railcar manufacturing facility during 2013 that did not continue into 2014. In 2014, production of hopper railcars ramped up due to increased demand, thus these repair projects were no longer being performed at our Railcar segment's manufacturing facilities.\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $322 million (44%) compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower shipment volumes and lower material and processing costs. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was a loss of 12% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to a loss of 2% for the prior year period. While material margin component of the gross margin improved during 2015 as compared to 2014, processing costs, as a percentage of net sales, increased over the respective periods. The improvement in material margin component of the gross margin reflected improved buying efforts despite the unfavorable impact of increased competition for shredder feedstock and lower pricing for non-ferrous auto shredder residue. Processing costs, as a percentage of net sales, increased due to decreases in sales volumes and market prices over the respective periods. PSC Metals continues to expend considerable effort to bring costs in line with lower volumes and market pricing. During 2015 PSC Metals closed nine feeder yards in order to better align its cost structure with the current economic climate.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of our Energy segment's petroleum business' gross margin to refining margin and refining margin adjusted for FIFO impacts for the periods indicated:\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nFood Packaging\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\naverage of 1.77% for non-U.S. plans and 3.84% for its OPEB. In calculating its benefit obligations, Federal-Mogul used a weighted-average discount rate of 4.15% for its U.S. pension plans, a weighted average discount rate of 2.72% for its non-U.S. pension plans and a discount rate of 4.18% for its OPEB.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nThe difference between the effective tax rate and statutory federal rate of 35% was principally due to partnership losses not subject to taxation.\nNet sales for 2015 increased by $17 million (10%) compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume. Cost of goods sold for 2015 increased by $11 million (7%) compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume. Gross margin for 2015 increased by $6 million (25%) compared to 2014. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 16% for 2015 as compared to 14% for 2014. The improvement was primarily due to higher margins on more profitable programs and customers.\nDebt consists of the following: \nARI repaid amounts outstanding under the ARI Revolving Loans in full and as of the date of this Report, ARI has borrowing availability of $200 million under the ARI Revolving Loans.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for 2015 of $714 million was primarily attributable to our Energy, Railcar and Gaming segments, offset in part by net cash used in operating activities attributable to our Investment segment and the Holding Company. Our Energy, Railcar and Gaming segments net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to earnings after adjusting for non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization and impairment.\nMajor Influences on Results of Operations\nThe Powertrain business generated approximately 63% of its sales outside of the United States and the resulting currency movements decreased sales by $407 million. On a constant dollar basis, Powertrain external sales increased 12% compared to the same period in 2014. The increase in Powertrain's sales reflects the inclusion of the acquisition of certain assets of the TRW engine components business, as well as increases in volume which, together, increased sales by $427 million. This figure includes the impact of customer price decreases of $28 million. Including the impact of sales from acquisitions, the Powertrain business' sales in North America, EMEA and ROW grew by 3.3%, 6.3% and 1%, respectively.\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased by $218 million (23%) compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower ferrous and non-ferrous shipment volumes and selling prices. Shipment volumes were lower in 2014 than in 2013 for all product lines except secondary plate, and average prices were lower for all product lines except brokerage.\nTropicana's Annual Report on Form 10-K contains a detailed description of its business, products, industry, operating strategy and associated risks. Tropicana's filings with the SEC are available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.\nRailcar shipments for the year ended December 31, 2015 were approximately 8,900 railcars, including approximately 5,060 railcars to leasing customers, as compared to 7,970 railcars for the prior year, of which approximately 5,230 railcars were to leasing customers. (Shipments of railcars for lease are included in manufacturing operations' net sales in the table above however they are eliminated from net sales in consolidation as they represent shipments to ARI's leasing business and ARL.)\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nDifferences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations. Actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses which are subject to amortization and expensed over future periods. The unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss on Federal-Mogul's pension plans was $532 million and $590 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Federal-Mogul expects to recognize amortization expense of $15 million in 2016.\nManagement periodically evaluates all evidence, both positive and negative, in determining whether a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets is still needed. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, we concluded, based on the projections of taxable income, that certain of our corporate subsidiaries more likely than not will realize a partial benefit from their deferred tax assets and loss carry forwards. Ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon, among other factors, our corporate subsidiaries' ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward periods and is subject to change depending on the tax laws in effect in the years in which the carryforwards are used. See Note 14, \"Income Taxes,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the reversal of our Gaming segment's deferred tax assets during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased by $10 million (4%) as compared to the prior year. While cost of goods sold decreased primarily due to lower sales volume, gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 25% and 23% for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The improvement in the gross margin as a percent of net sales over the comparable period was due to improved plant performance.\n\nThe Investment Funds' aggregate return was 30.8% for 2013 primarily due to gains in their long exposure, primarily in a few of the largest core holdings. These gains were partially offset by losses in their short equity exposure, including broad market hedges as equity markets rallied in 2013.\nFederal-Mogul is a defendant in lawsuits filed, or the recipient of administrative orders issued or demand letters received, in various jurisdictions pursuant to the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ( CERCLA\u201d) or other similar national, provincial or state environmental remedial laws. These laws provide that responsible parties may be liable to pay for remediating contamination resulting from hazardous substances that were discharged into the environment by them, by prior owners or occupants of property they currently own or operate, or by others to whom they sent such substances for treatment or other disposition at third party locations. Federal-Mogul has been notified by the EPA, other national environmental agencies, and various provincial and state agencies that it may be a potentially responsible party ( PRP\u201d) under such laws for the cost of remediating hazardous substances pursuant to CERCLA and other national and state or provincial environmental laws. PRP designation often results in the funding of site investigations and subsequent remedial activities.\nRevenues from our real estate operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are substantially derived from our club and rental operations, including the gain on sale of various properties previously leased to others. Revenues from sales of residential units in our real estate development operations represent 11% and 15% of total Real Estate revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\n\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, such as goodwill and trademarks, held by our various segments are reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. Goodwill impairment testing involves a two-step process. Step 1 compares the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no further analysis is necessary. The reporting unit fair value is based upon consideration of various valuation methodologies, including guideline transaction multiples, multiples of current earnings, and projected future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the risk involved.

Through its locations, IEH Auto sells predominantly to commercial aftermarket customers in the do-it-for-me market as well as retail and do-it-yourself customers. IEH Auto operates independently of Federal-Mogul.\nIn November 2013, Tropicana entered into (i) a senior secured first lien term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $300 million, issued at a discount of 0.5% (the Term Loan Facility\u201d) and (ii) a senior secured first lien revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $15 million (the Revolving Facility\u201d and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the Credit Facilities\u201d). Commencing on December 31, 2013, the Term Loan Facility amortizes in equal quarterly installments in an amount of $750,000, with any remaining balance payable on November 27, 2020. Amounts under the Revolving Facility are available to be borrowed and re-borrowed until its termination on November 27, 2018. As of December 31, 2015, the Revolving Facility was undrawn and had $15 million of availability. See Note 10, \"Debt - Gaming\" in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the Credit Facilities.\nThe difference between the effective tax rate and statutory federal rate of 35% was principally due to changes in valuation allowances and partnership income not subject to taxation, as such taxes are the responsibility of the partners.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to 2013\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nFinancing Activities\nOur consolidated SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $208 million (15%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $89 million from our Gaming segment primarily due to inclusion of the Lumi\u00e8re acquisition during the second quarter of 2014, $76 million from our Automotive segment primarily due to the recognition of an OPEB curtailment gain during the second quarter of 2013 (which reduced SG&A in 2013), and the inclusion of the Affinia and Honeywell acquisitions during the second quarter and third quarter of 2014, respectively, and an increase of $48 million from our Investment segment due to higher compensation expense attributable to a certain fund performance.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for 2015 was primarily attributable to certain debt refinancing and draw down on revolver facilities at our Railcar and Automotive segments, resulting in approximately $1.0 billion in net proceeds. Additionally, our Investment segment had capital contributions of $276 million from affiliates of Mr. Icahn.\n\nThe Investment Funds' aggregate return was -7.4% for 2014, due to losses in their short equity exposure, primarily through broad market hedges, as well as other losses in long equity positions including energy. These losses were partially offset by gains in long equity positions in a few of their largest core holdings.\nRevenues from our real estate operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 are substantially derived from our club and rental operations. Revenues from sales of residential units in our real estate development operations represent 15% and less than 5% of total Real Estate revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nDerivative Instruments\nAs discussed in Note 5, Investments and Related Matters,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements, we have contractual liabilities of $794 million related to securities sold, not yet purchased as of December 31, 2015. This amount has not been included in the table above as maturity is not subject to a contract and cannot be properly estimated.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nOn January 24, 2013, the board of directors of CVR adopted a quarterly cash dividend policy. CVR began paying regular quarterly dividends in the second quarter of 2013. Dividends are subject to change at the discretion of CVR's board of directors and may change from quarter to quarter. In addition, the current policy of the respective board of directors of CVR Refining and CVR Partners is to distribute all of the respective available cash of CVR Refining and CVR Partners each quarter. CVR Refining and CVR Partners do not have a legal obligation to pay distributions and there is no guarantee that they will pay any distributions on the units in any quarter.\ndepositary unitholder. On May 29, 2013, the board of directors of our general partner further modified our distribution policy to increase our annual distribution from $4.00 per depositary unit to $5.00 per depositary unit. Further, on March 3, 2014, the board of directors of our general partner announced an increase in our annualized distribution from $5.00 per depositary unit to $6.00 per depositary unit.\nIn addition to the amounts in the table above, our Energy segment has $28 million in standby letters of credit to secure transportation services for crude oil.\nOur consolidated impairment for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $119 million (744%) as compared to the corresponding prior year period. The increase was primarily due to impairment of goodwill by our Energy segment of $103 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. See Note 6, \"Fair Value Measurements,\" and Note 8, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net - Energy,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $350 million (49%) as compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower ferrous and non-ferrous shipment volumes and selling prices.\nAutomotive\nIn order to assess the operating performance of the nitrogen fertilizer business, CVR calculates the product pricing at gate as an input to determine its operating margin. Product pricing at gate represents net sales less freight revenue divided by product sales volume in tons. CVR believes product pricing at gate is a meaningful measure because it sells products at its plant gate and terminal locations' gates (sold gate) and delivered to the customer's designated delivery site (sold delivered). The relative percentage of sold gate versus sold delivered can change period to period. The product pricing at gate provides a measure that is consistently comparable period to period.\nThe North American railcar market has been, and our Railcar segment expects it to continue to be, highly cyclical. The tank railcar market continues to soften, which we believe is driven by multiple factors including record high deliveries of tank railcars in recent years. Additionally, the recent volatility in oil prices and uncertainty surrounding the May 2015 release of regulations related to tank railcars in the U.S. and Canada have led to reduced demand for railcars in the energy transportation industry. Customers continue to weigh the costs versus benefits of investing in new tank railcars or modifying their existing tank railcars for flammable service. Our Railcar segment cannot assure you that hopper or tank railcar demand will maintain its current pace or return to historical average levels, that demand for any railcar types or railcar services will improve, or that our railcar backlog, orders or shipments will track industry-wide trends.\nOur Energy segment's nitrogen fertilizer business uses forward swap contracts primarily to reduce the exposure to changes in interest rates on its debt and to provide a cash flow hedge. These derivative instruments have been designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Accordingly, these instruments are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets at each reporting period end. The actual measurement of the cash flow hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings, if applicable. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the swaps is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in accordance with FASB ASC 815.\nOur Gaming segment has federal net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards pursuant to the purchase of Adamar of New Jersey, Inc. ( Adamar\u201d). Internal Revenue Code Section 382 ( Code 382\u201d) places certain limitations on the annual amount of NOL carryforwards that can be utilized when a change of ownership occurs. Our Gaming segment believes its purchase of Adamar was a change in ownership pursuant to Code 382. As a result of the annual limitation, the NOL carryforward amount available to be used in future periods was $161 million and will begin to expire in the year 2028 and forward. As of March 8, 2010, Tropicana had various net deferred tax assets made up primarily of the expected future tax benefit of net operating loss carryforwards and excess tax basis not yet deductible for tax purposes. A valuation allowance was provided in full against these net deferred tax assets upon emergence from bankruptcy. During the year ended December 31, 2014, our Gaming segment reversed the valuation allowance related to the net deferred tax assets by $196 million. The reduction in the valuation allowance was a result of our Gaming segment analyzing all positive and negative evidence and concluding that it was more likely than not to realize the benefit of this portion of its net deferred tax assets. The reduction in the valuation allowance was recorded as an income tax benefit during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nWith respect to the notional value of our short derivative swap positions (213% short exposure), our liquidity would decrease by the balance sheet unrealized loss if we were to close the positions at year end prices. This would be offset by a release of restricted cash balances collateralizing these positions as well as an increase in funds available to us pursuant to certain prime brokerage lines of credit. If we were to increase our short exposure by adding to these short positions, we would be required to provide cash collateral equal to a small percentage of the initial notional value at counterparties that require cash as collateral and then post additional collateral equal to 100% of the mark to market on adverse changes in fair value. For our counterparties who do not require cash collateral, funds available from lines of credit would decrease.\nOn February 28, 2016, Icahn Enterprises issued a proposal to the board of directors of Federal-Mogul to purchase the shares of Federal-Mogul common stock not owned by us in a merger transaction pursuant to which Federal-Mogul shareholders would receive $7.00 per share in cash for their Federal-Mogul shares.\nOn February 23, 2016, the board of directors of the general partner of Icahn Enterprises declared a quarterly distribution in the amount of $1.50 per depositary unit, which will be paid on or about April 12, 2016 to depositary unitholders of record at the close of business on March 7, 2016. Depositary unitholders will have until March, 31 2016 to make an election to receive either cash or additional depositary units; if a holder does not make an election, it will automatically be deemed to have elected to receive the dividend in cash. Depositary unitholders who elect to receive additional depositary units will receive units valued at the volume weighted average trading price of the units on NASDAQ during the 5 consecutive trading days ending April 7, 2016. No fractional depositary units will be issued pursuant to the distribution payment. Icahn Enterprises will make a cash payment in lieu of issuing fractional depositary units to any holders electing to receive depositary units. Any holders that would only be eligible to receive a fraction of a depositary unit based on the above calculation will receive a cash payment.\non factors beyond its control, including the supply of and demand for crude oil, as well as gasoline and other refined products which, in turn, depend on, among other factors, changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and foreign political affairs, production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels and the extent of government regulation. Because the petroleum business applies first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") accounting to value its inventory, crude oil price movements may impact net income in the short term because of changes in the value of its unhedged on-hand inventory. The effect of changes in crude oil prices on our results of operations is influenced by the rate at which the prices of refined products adjust to reflect these changes.\nOur share of the Investment Funds' net (losses) profits through our interests in the Investment Funds was $(760) million, $(305) million, and $812 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nSee Note 10, Debt,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report for additional information concerning terms, restrictions and covenants of our debt. As of December 31, 2015, we are in compliance with all debt covenants.\nPerformance Attribution\nOur Railcar segment's current capital expenditure plans for 2016 include projects that our Railcar segment expects will expand capabilities, maintain equipment, improve efficiencies and reduce costs. Our Railcar segment also plans to increase its railcar lease fleet in 2016 to meet customer demand for leased railcars that have been ordered. Capital expenditures for 2016 are currently projected to be approximately $117 million, which includes expected additions to our Railcar segment's lease fleet of approximately $80 million.\nFor 2015, Icahn Enterprises recorded an income tax expense of $68 million on pre-tax loss of $2.1 billion compared to an income tax benefit of $103 million on pre-tax loss of $632 million for 2014. Icahn Enterprises' effective income tax rate was (3.3)% and 16.3% for 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nFederal-Mogul's subsidiaries in Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States are party to accounts receivable factoring and securitization facilities. Gross accounts receivable transferred under these facilities were $408 million and $306 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of those gross amounts, $401 million and $293 million, respectively, qualify as sales as defined in FASB ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing. The remaining transferred receivables were pledged as collateral and accounted for as secured borrowings and recorded in the consolidated balance sheets within accounts receivable, net and debt. Proceeds from the transfers of accounts receivable qualifying as sales were $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nAdditionally, during 2015 we acquired certain businesses within our Automotive segment as well as acquired Ferrous Resources, which constitutes our Mining segment. Also, during 2015 our Holding Company purchased certain investments, including a non-controlling interest in Pep Boys, as discussed earlier, and which we subsequently acquired the entire company in February 2016. See Note 3, \"Operating Units - Automotive,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding thesse acquisition.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nCertain of the facilities contain terms that require Federal-Mogul to share in the credit risk of the sold receivables. The maximum exposures to Federal-Mogul associated with certain of these facilities' terms were $11 million and $17 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOur Interests in the Investment Funds\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nOther Segments\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nExcluding the unfavorable currency impact of $235 million, Motorparts' external sales increased by $291 million (net of intercompany eliminations). This increase was primarily due to additional sales related to the Honeywell braking and Affinia chassis component acquisitions. Including the impact of sales from acquisitions, the Motorparts business' sales in North America, EMEA and ROW grew by 1.4%, 4.8% and 1.6%, respectively.\nOther Income, Net\nReal Estate\nMany of the sites that are likely to be the costliest to remediate are often current or former commercial waste disposal facilities to which numerous companies sent wastes. Despite the potential joint and several liability which might be imposed on Federal-Mogul under CERCLA and some of the other laws pertaining to these sites, its share of the total waste sent to these sites has generally been small. Federal-Mogul believes its exposure for liability at these sites is limited.\nGlobal vehicle sales increased by 1.8% in 2015. European vehicle sales rose 3.5% from 2014 levels. North American vehicles sales increased 6.3%, with positive growth in Canada, Mexico and the United States. Vehicle sales in the Asia-Pacific\nGaming\nWe have off-balance sheet risk related to investment activities associated with certain financial instruments, including futures, options, credit default swaps and securities sold, not yet purchased.

Refining margin and refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact are non-GAAP measures that we believe are important to investors in evaluating our Energy segment refineries' performance as a general indication of the amount above our Energy segment's cost of goods sold (taking into account the impact of utilization of FIFO) they are able to sell refined products. We believe that refining margin and refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel are important to enable investors to better understand and evaluate our Energy segment's ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in the review of our overall financial, operational and economic performance. In addition, we believe that presenting refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel adjusted for FIFO impact is useful to investors because this measure more accurately reflects the current operating environment.\nAutomotive\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSince inception in November 2004, the Investment Funds' gross return is 171.1%, representing an annualized rate of return of 9.3% through December 31, 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nThe following table sets forth the performance attribution for the Investment Funds for the comparative periods presented.\nInvestment\nCVR Dividends and CVR Refining Distributions\nNet gain from investment activities was $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to a loss of $137 million for the corresponding prior year period. The net gain from investment activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was attributable to certain securities held by the Holding Company. The net loss from investment activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes realized and unrealized losses from certain derivative swaps that were assigned to the Holding Company from the Investment segment during August 2013. These derivative swaps were closed out during the third quarter of 2014. See Note 7, \"Financial Instruments - Investment Segment and Holding Company,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nMeasurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets that we expect to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\nOur Investment segment is comprised of various private investment funds, including Icahn Partners L.P. (\"Icahn Partners\"), Icahn Partners Master Fund LP, Icahn Partners Master Fund II LP and Icahn Partners Master Fund III LP (collectively, the \"Master Funds\", and together with Icahn Partners, the \"Investment Funds\"), through which we invest our proprietary capital. Effective January 1, 2014, Icahn Partners Master Fund II LP and Icahn Partners Master Fund III LP were merged with and into Icahn Partners. We and certain of Mr. Icahn's wholly owned affiliates are the sole investors in the Investment Funds. Icahn Onshore LP and Icahn Offshore LP (together, the \"General Partners\") act as the general partner of Icahn Partners and the Master Funds, respectively. The General Partners provide investment advisory and certain administrative and back office services to the Investment Funds but do not provide such services to any other entities, individuals or accounts. Interests in the Investment Funds are not offered to outside investors.\nOn February 3, 2016, pursuant to a tender offer, Icahn Enterprises acquired a majority of the outstanding shares of Pep Boys - Manny, Moe & Jack (\"Pep Boys\"), a leading aftermarket provider of automotive service, tires, parts and accessories across the United States and Puerto Rico. On February 4, 2016, Icahn Enterprises completed the acquisition of the remaining outstanding shares of Pep Boys and our wholly owned subsidiary, IEP Parts Acquisition LLC, merged with and into Pep Boys, with Pep Boys surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Icahn Enterprises Holdings. The total value for the acquisition of Pep Boys was approximately $1.2 billion, including the fair value of our equity interest in Pep-Boys just prior to our acquisition of a controlling interest. Pep Boys' operations will comprise a portion of our Automotive segment and will be operated independently of Federal-Mogul and IEH Auto.\nMetals\nDue to the structure of our business, the consolidated results of operations for Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings are substantially the same. Differences primarily relate to non-cash portions of interest expense, and are only reflected in the results of operations for our Holding Company. The following table summarizes total revenues, net (loss) income and net (loss) income attributable to Icahn Enterprises Holdings for our Holding Company and the consolidated totals with respect to Icahn Enterprises Holdings for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nOur Energy segment's petroleum business uses futures contracts, options, and forward contracts primarily to reduce exposure to changes in crude oil prices and finished goods product prices to provide economic hedges of inventory positions. Although management considers these derivatives economic hedges, these derivative instruments do not qualify as hedges for hedge accounting purposes under FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (\"FASB ASC 815\"), and accordingly are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded in earnings as a component of other income, net in the period of change. The estimated fair values of forward and swap contracts are based on quoted market prices and assumptions for the estimated forward yield curves of related commodities in periods when quoted market prices are unavailable.\nIcahn Enterprises owns a 99% limited partner interest in Icahn Enterprises Holdings. Icahn Enterprises G.P. Inc. ( Icahn Enterprises GP\u201d), which is owned and controlled by Mr. Carl C. Icahn, owns a 1% general partner interest in each of Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings. Icahn Enterprises Holdings and its subsidiaries own substantially all of our assets and liabilities and conduct substantially all of our operations. Therefore, the financial results of Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings are substantially the same, with differences relating primarily to debt, as discussed further in Note 10, \"Debt,\" to the consolidated financial statements, and to the allocation of the general partner interest, which is reflected as an aggregate 1.99% general partner interest in the financial statements of Icahn Enterprises. In addition to the above, Mr. Icahn and his affiliates owned 117,033,818, or approximately 89.0%, of Icahn Enterprises' outstanding depositary units as of December 31, 2015.\nLong-lived assets held and used by our various operating segments and long-lived assets to be disposed of are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as vacancies and rejected leases and reduced production capacity, indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In performing the review for recoverability, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest charges, is less than the carrying amount of the asset an impairment loss is recognized.\nNet sales and cost of goods sold for the period June 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015 were $30 million and $38 million, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nOf our long exposure of 199%, the fair value of our long positions (with certain adjustments) represented 193% of our long exposure. The notional value of our long derivative positions, which primarily included single name equity swaps and single name OTC equity forward contracts, represented 6% of our long exposure.\nPart of Tropicana's overall strategy includes consideration of expansion opportunities in new gaming jurisdictions, underserved markets and acquisition and other strategic opportunities that may arise periodically. Tropicana may require additional funds in order to execute on such strategic growth, and may incur additional debt or issue additional equity to finance any such transactions. We cannot assure you that Tropicana will be able to incur such debt or issue any such additional equity on acceptable terms or at all.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCommitments and Contingencies - Litigation\nDefinite-lived assets held by our various segments are periodically reviewed for impairment indicators. If impairment indicators exist, we perform the required analysis and record an impairment charge as required by applicable U.S. GAAP.\nThe Investment Funds historically have had access to significant amounts of cash available from prime brokerage lines of credit, subject to customary terms and market conditions.\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased by $220 million (23%) compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower shipment volumes and lower material and processing costs. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was a loss of 2% for each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, as margins continued to be negatively impacted by ongoing competitive pressure for shredder feedstock.\nOur Railcar segment continues to invest capital and evaluate opportunities to further expand its manufacturing flexibility and repair capacity. During 2015 our Railcar segment completed three repair expansion projects and just recently in 2016 completed an expansion project at its tank railcar manufacturing facility, which enables it to perform retrofit and repair work in addition to the manufacturing work already performed there. Also during 2015, our Railcar segment began production of its newly designed tank railcars that satisfy the May 2015 regulations. Our Railcar segment's continuous commitment to quality and its efforts to increase flexibility at its tank railcar manufacturing facility allows it to build these designs efficiently and cost\n \u2022 Long-term rate of return on plan assets: The required use of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year. While the development of the long-term rate of return on assets gives appropriate consideration to recent fund performance and historical returns, the assumption is designed to approximate a long-term prospective rate. The expected long-term rate of return used to calculate net periodic pension cost is 6.55% for U.S. plans and a weighted average of 3.52% for non-U.S. plans. \nRefining margin per barrel of crude oil throughput decreased to $11.38 for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $16.90 for the corresponding prior year period. Refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact was $13.62 per crude oil throughput barrel for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $16.59 per crude oil throughput barrel for the corresponding prior year period. Gross margin per barrel decreased to $3.42 for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to gross margin per barrel of $9.48 in the corresponding prior year period. The decrease in refining margin and gross margin per barrel was primarily due to a decrease in sales price for gasoline and distillate. The average sales price for both gasoline and distillates declined approximately 7% for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year period.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the borrowing availability under the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolving Facility was $170 million and $516 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, the outstanding balance on the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolving Facility was $340 million. As of December 31, 2014, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolving Facility. Federal-Mogul had $40 million and $34 million of letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, under Federal-Mogul's term loan credit facility. To the extent letters of credit are issued under the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolving Facility there will be a corresponding decrease in borrowings available under this facility.\nOn an ongoing basis, we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us. While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions, we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, we make estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries, if any. We accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made.\nIEH Auto\nOur consolidated other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $75 million and $182 million, respectively. Equity earnings from non-consolidated affiliates, primarily from our Automotive segment, were $62 million and $50 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, our Energy segment recorded (loss) gains on certain derivative contracts of $(29) million and $186 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Included in our consolidated other income, net was a loss on extinguishment of debt of $162 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. See Note 7, \"Financial Instruments,\" and Note 16, \"Other Income, Net,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nOn January 30, 2014, Viskase entered into a credit agreement that provided for a $275 million senior secured covenant light term loan facility ( Viskase Term Loan\u201d). The Viskase Term Loan bears interest at a LIBOR Rate plus 3.25% (with the LIBOR Rate carrying a 1.00% floor), or at a Base Rate equal to the sum of (1) the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate, (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%, (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1.0%, or (d) 2.0%, plus (2) 2.25%. The Viskase Term Loan has a 1% per annum amortization with a maturity date of January 30, 2021. See Note 10, \"Debt - Food Packaging,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding this credit facility.\nConsolidated interest expense for Icahn Enterprises increased by $287 million (51%) as compared to the corresponding prior year period. The increase for Icahn Enterprises Holdings was $286 million (51%). The increases were primarily due to higher interest expense from our Investment segment attributable to due to broker balances, higher interest expense from our Automotive segment due to refinancing of its term loans in April 2014, higher interest expense from our Railcar segment due to higher debt balances, offset in part by lower interest expense from our Energy segment due to overall lower interest rate on outstanding debt balances and higher capitalized interest, lower interest expense from our Food Packaging segment due to lower interest rates on outstanding debt balances and lower interest on debt refinancing from the Holding Company during the first quarter of 2014.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.\nNet revenues from Tropicana AC comprise approximately 40% and 43% of our Gaming segment's net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Tropicana AC casino revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year period as a result of increased customer volumes due, in part, to the closure of one of Tropicana AC's competitors in Atlantic City in January 2014. In addition, during the third quarter of 2014, three additional competitors ceased operations in Atlantic City. Based on market data, the Atlantic City market experienced year-over-year decline in casino win of 8.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, Tropicana AC casino revenues increased primarily due to 17.9% higher slot volumes and 4.3 percentage point increase in the table game hold percentage, partially offset by 16.0% lower table game volumes, including lower volumes of high-end play for the year ended December 31, 2014. Internet gaming, which commenced in November 2013, also contributed to the increase in casino revenues.\nAs discussed in Note 3, \"Operating Units - Mining,\" to the consolidated financial statements, we obtained control, and consolidated, the results of Ferrous Resources Limited (\"Ferrous Resources\") during the second quarter of 2015. Ferrous Resources represents our Mining segment.\nOur Food Packaging segment is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates. In addition to those markets in which Viskase prices its products in U.S. dollars, it prices its products in certain of its foreign operations in euros and Brazilian reals. As a result, a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies of profitable foreign subsidiaries can have a favorable effect on Viskase's profitability. Conversely, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currencies of profitable foreign subsidiaries can have a negative effect on the profitability of our Food Packaging segment.\nGross margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $37 million (4%) as compared to the corresponding prior year period. Gross margin was 14% and 15% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in the gross margin percentage over the respective periods was primarily due to costs incurred related to Motorparts business strategic initiatives as well as unfavorable foreign currency impact.\nWe finalized the annual goodwill impairment test for our Energy segment during the third quarter of 2015. Based on the results of our annual goodwill impairment test for our Energy segment, while the fair market value of our Energy segment's Petroleum reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value, the fair market value of our Energy segment's Fertilizer reporting unit was approximately 1% in excess of its carrying value and was therefore considered at risk for failing \"Step 1\" of the goodwill impairment analysis. Based on worsening sales trends for our Energy segment's Fertilizer reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2015, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test for our Energy segment's Fertilizer reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2015. Based on this analysis, our Energy segment recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $253 million, which represented the full amount of the remaining goodwill allocated to this reporting unit. Due to the complexity in \"Step 2\" goodwill impairment test, we expect to finalize the assessment of our Energy segment's goodwill\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, creating a new topic, FASB ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, superseding revenue recognition requirements in FASB ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. This ASU requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, an entity is required to disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. This ASU was amended by ASU No. 2015-14, issued in August 2015, which deferred the original effective date by one year; the effective date of this ASU is for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, using one of two retrospective application methods. Early adoption is permitted only as of the annual reporting periods beginning after\nTropicana estimates that its aggregate capital expenditures for 2016 will be $81 million. In addition, Tropicana estimates that it will spend approximately $25 million in 2016 related to its $50 million commitment to develop a landside gaming facility at one of its properties.\nForeign currencies\nSee Note 10, \"Debt - Railcar,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding these refinancings.\nFederal-Mogul sponsors defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans for certain employees and retirees around the world. Federal-Mogul's defined benefit plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return, discount rate, and mortality and mortality improvement rates of plan participants.\nThe scrap metals business is highly cyclical and is substantially dependent upon the overall economic conditions in the U.S. and other global markets. Ferrous and non-ferrous scrap has been historically vulnerable to significant declines in consumption and product pricing during prolonged periods of economic downturn or stagnation.\nand sold in connection with its restructuring activities and has accrued $16 million as of December 31, 2015, primarily related to removing hazardous materials in buildings. For further discussion regarding these commitments, among others, see Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\nOur Automotive segment is affected by the following trends and market conditions:\nStatements included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d which are not historical in nature are intended to be, and are hereby identified as, forward-looking statements\u201d for purposes of the safe harbor provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or by Public Law 104-67.\nGaming\nRailcar services revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period primarily due to an increase in demand, a favorable change in mix of work at our Railcar segment's repair facilities and the additional capacity resulting from expansion projects during 2015.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which amends FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Current GAAP requires an entity to separate income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. This ASU requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We have elected to early adopt this ASU for the year ended December 31, 2015 on a prospective basis. As we do not present a classified statement of position, this ASU will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and disclosures.\nFederal-Mogul's net sales were negatively impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against several global currencies which resulted in an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $642 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Federal-Mogul's sales volumes increased by $718 million. This sales growth is comprised of an increase in the Powertrain business' external sales of $427 million, reflecting the inclusion of the acquisition of certain engine components business of TRW Automotive Holdings Corp.'s (\"TRW\") as well as an increase in volume for the quarter. External sales in the Motorparts business increased by $291 million (net of intercompany eliminations), driven primarily by the acquisitions of Affinia Group Inc. (\"Affinia\") and Honeywell International Inc.'s (\"Honeywell\") brake component business.\nOn April 15, 2014, Federal-Mogul entered into a tranche B term loan facility (the Tranche B Facility\u201d) and a tranche C term loan facility (the Tranche C Facility,\u201d and together with the Tranche B Facility, the Federal-Mogul Term Facilities\u201d), and assumed all of the obligations of Federal-Mogul Corporation with respect to the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolving Facility.\nRailcar leasing revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period due to an increase in number of railcars leased to customers as lease rates were relatively flat compared to 2014. Total railcars on lease at the end of 2015 were approximately 45,050 as compared to approximately 39,700 at the end of 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSummarized ferrous tons and non-ferrous pounds sold for 2015, 2014 and 2013 are as follows:\nThe recent decline in oil prices results in lower fuel prices for consumers. Lower fuel prices provide consumers with more discretionary income for vehicle repairs and tends to encourage more driving miles, which in turn accelerates wear on vehicle components, accelerating the need for replacements. Low fuel prices also encourage more vehicle sales, which increases demand for parts from OEMs.\nThe Federal-Mogul Term Facilities, among other things, (i) provide for aggregate commitments under the Tranche B Facility of $700 million with a maturity date of April 15, 2018, (ii) provide for aggregate commitments under the Tranche C Facility of approximately $1.9 billion with a maturity date of April 15, 2021, (iii) increase the interest rates applicable to the Federal-Mogul Term Facilities, (iv) provide that for all outstanding letters of credit there is a corresponding decrease in borrowings available under the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolving Facility, (v) provide that in the event that as of a particular determination date more than $700 million aggregate principal amount of existing term loans and certain related refinancing indebtedness will become due within 91 days of such determination date, the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolving Facility will mature on such determination date, (vi) provide for additional incremental indebtedness, secured on a pari passu basis, of an unlimited amount of additional indebtedness if Federal-Mogul meets a financial covenant incurrence test, and (vii) amend certain other restrictive covenants. Pursuant to the Federal-Mogul Term Facilities, Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation assumed all of the obligations of Federal-Mogul Corporation with respect to the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolving Facility.\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $317 million (5%) as compared to the prior year (net of certain intercompany activity). The increase attributable to Federal-Mogul was primarily due to an increase in sales volumes in both the Powertrain and Motorparts businesses, reflecting an inclusion of the acquisitions of the TRW engine component business, the Affinia chasis business as well as the Honeywell brake component business. In addition, cost of goods sold increased due to the IEH Auto acquisition.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nFerrous Resources' performance driver has historically been demand for raw materials from Chinese steelmakers. However, for the period June 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, our Mining segment has been concentrating on sales in its domestic market, Brazil, where the best margins are being captured. During the fourth quarter of 2015, both domestic and global steel industries continued to show weakness as steel mills' utilization rates failed to recover and iron ore prices remained weak.\nForward-Looking Statements\nFor 2014, Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings recognized a deferred tax benefit on its pre-tax loss primarily due to income tax benefits recorded on a release of valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets in our Gaming segment of $196 million.\nHome Fashion\nOn October 23, 2012, CVR Refining LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Coffeyville Finance Inc., completed a private offering of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (the \"2022 Notes\"). The net proceeds from the offering of the 2022 Notes were used to purchase certain first lien secured notes due 2015 through a tender offer and settled redemption in the fourth quarter of 2012.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nThe following table reflects, at December 31, 2015, our contractual cash obligations, subject to certain conditions, due over the indicated periods:\nCost of goods sold for the petroleum business, before eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period decreased by $3.8 billion (45%), primarily due to a decrease in cost of consumed crude oil and purchased products for resale. The decrease in consumed crude oil cost was due to a decrease in crude oil throughput volume and crude oil prices. The average cost per barrel of crude oil consumed for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $47.86 as compared to $92.57 for the comparable prior period, a decrease of approximately 48%. The impact of FIFO accounting also impacted cost of goods sold during the comparable periods. Under the FIFO accounting method, changes in crude oil prices can cause fluctuations in the inventory valuation of crude oil, work in process and finished goods, thereby resulting in a favorable FIFO inventory impact when crude oil prices increase and an unfavorable FIFO inventory impact when crude oil prices decrease. For the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the petroleum business had unfavorable FIFO inventory impacts of $60 million and $161 million, respectively. The major factor contributing to the unfavorable FIFO impact for the year ended December 31, 2014 was the decline in the market price of West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\"), a grade of crude oil used as a benchmark in oil pricing, from $95.44 at the beginning of 2014 to $53.27 on December 31, 2014. The FIFO inventory impact for 2014 included a lower of cost or market write-down of $37 million, which was recorded in the fourth quarter as a result of the significant decline in the market price of crude oil.\nregion increased 1.5% in 2015, reaching another record high. Among the major regions, only South America posted a decline in 2015 which was down 21.1%.\nTropicana's cash flows are and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, many of which are outside of its control, including regulatory restrictions, competition and other general business conditions. Tropicana believes that it will have sufficient liquidity through a combination of available cash, credit facilities and cash flow from its properties to fund its cash requirements and capital expenditures for its normal operating activities.\nFederal-Mogul is a leading global supplier of a broad range of components, accessories and systems to the automotive, small engine, heavy-duty, marine, railroad, agricultural, off-road, aerospace and energy, industrial and transport markets, including customers in both the original equipment manufacturers and servicers ( OE\u201d) market and the replacement market ( aftermarket\u201d). Federal-Mogul's customers include the world's largest automotive OEs and major distributors and retailers in the independent aftermarket.\nPart Replacement Trends\nDuring 2015, we declared four quarterly distributions aggregating $6.00 per depositary unit. Depositary unitholders were given the option to make an election to receive the distributions in either cash or additional depositary units; if a holder did not make an election, it was automatically deemed to have elected to receive the distributions in cash. All four distributions declared in 2015 were paid in 2015. As a result of the above declared distributions, during 2015 we distributed an aggregate 8,337,645 of Icahn Enterprises' depositary units to those Depositary unitholders who elected to receive such distributions in additional depositary units. Additionally, during 2015 we paid $114 million to those Depositary unitholders who had elected to receive such distributions in cash.\nIn order to derive the refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel, our Energy segment utilizes the total dollar figures for refining margin, as derived above, and divides that by the applicable number of crude oil throughput barrels for the period. Our Energy segment's calculation of refining margin and refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact may differ from calculations of other companies in the industry, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Under our Energy segment's FIFO accounting method, changes in crude oil prices can cause fluctuations in the inventory valuation of our Energy segment's crude oil, work in process and finished goods, thereby resulting in favorable FIFO impacts when crude oil prices increase and unfavorable FIFO impacts when crude oil prices decrease.\nAdditionally, our Railcar segment expects its future cash flows from operations could be impacted by the state of the credit markets and the overall economy, the number of our Railcar segment's railcar orders and shipments and its production rates. Our Railcar segment's future liquidity may also be impacted by the number of new railcar orders leased versus sold.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nNet sales for the fertilizer business, before eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year period decreased by $25 million (8%), primarily due to lower UAN sales prices and ammonia sales volumes, partially offset by higher UAN sales volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2014, CVR sold 951,043 and 24,378 tons of UAN and ammonia, respectively, with a sales price of $288 and $536 per ton, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2013, CVR sold 904,596 and 40,535 tons of UAN and ammonia, respectively, with sales price of $315 and $660 per ton, respectively. On-stream factors (total number of hours operated divided by total hours in the reporting period) for the gasification, ammonia and UAN units were 96.8%, 92.6% and 92.0%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 95.6%, 94.4% and 91.9%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nFederal-Mogul has conditional asset retirement obligations (\"CARO\"), primarily related to removal costs of hazardous materials in buildings, for which it believes reasonable cost estimates cannot be made at this time because it does not believe it has a reasonable basis to assign probabilities to a range of potential settlement dates for these retirement obligations. Accordingly, Federal-Mogul is currently unable to determine amounts to accrue for CARO at such sites.\neffectively. Our Railcar segment cannot assure you any increased repair capacity or manufacturing flexibility will be sufficient or necessary to meet the demands of the industry.\nCost of goods sold for the petroleum business, before eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year period increased by $550 million (7%), primarily due to an increase in cost of consumed oil and refined fuels purchased for resale. The average cost per barrel of crude oil consumed for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $92.57 compared to $95.05 for the comparable period of 2013, a decrease of approximately 3%. Sales volume of refined fuels increased by approximately 8%. The impact of FIFO accounting also impacted cost of goods sold during the comparable periods. Under the FIFO accounting method, changes in crude oil prices can cause fluctuations in the inventory valuation of crude oil, work in process and finished goods, thereby resulting in a favorable FIFO inventory impact when crude oil prices increase and an unfavorable FIFO inventory impact when crude oil prices decrease. For the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the petroleum business had an unfavorable FIFO inventory impact of $161 million and a favorable FIFO inventory impact of $21 million, respectively. The major factor contributing to the unfavorable FIFO impact for the year ended December 31, 2014 was the decline in the market price of WTI from $95.44 at the beginning of 2014 to $53.27 on December 31, 2014. The FIFO inventory impact for 2014 includes a lower of cost or market write-down of $37 million, which was recorded in the fourth quarter as a result of the significant decline in the market price of crude oil.\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of April 30 of each year for our Energy segment, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. The first step of the impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of our Energy segment's assets to their respective carrying values to determine the potential for goodwill impairment. The second step of the impairment test, if necessary, involves quantifying the level of goodwill impairment.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our Holding Company had investments in the Investment Funds with a total fair market value of approximately $3.4 billion. As of December 31, 2015, our Holding Company had cash and cash equivalents of $166 million and total debt of approximately $5.5 billion.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nprimarily driven by lower shipments of aluminum products due to the exit from aluminum tolling activities at the end of the first quarter of 2014 and to a refocus of aluminum shredding capacity in 2014. Average selling prices for non-ferrous decreased $0.03 per pound (3%) due to lower market pricing.\nNet sales for the petroleum business, before eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year period increased by $146 million (2%), primarily due to higher overall sales volume largely offset by lower sales prices for gasoline and distillates. Sales volume increased by approximately 8% for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year period. Sales volumes for 2014 were impacted by reduced crude oil throughput and production as a result of the Coffeyville refinery shutdown following the isomerization unit fire during the third quarter of 2014 and FCCU outage at the Wynnewood refinery during the fourth quarter of 2014. Sales volumes for 2013 were impacted by downtime associated with the FCCU outage at the Coffeyville refinery during the third quarter of 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, CVR's petroleum business sold approximately 40.3 million and 34.9 million barrels of gasoline and distillate, respectively, with an average sales price per gallon for gasoline and distillate of $2.53 and $2.81, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2013, CVR's petroleum business sold approximately 37.8 million and 30.6 million barrels of gasoline and distillate, respectively, with an average sales price per gallon for gasoline and distillate of $2.72 and $3.02, respectively.\nThe Investment Funds' aggregate return was -18.0% for 2015, due to losses in their long equity exposure, primarily in a few of their largest core holdings including energy. These losses were partially offset by gains in long equity positions in a few of their largest core holdings as well as gains in their short positions, including broad market hedges.\nDistributions on Depositary Units\n\nWith respect to both our long positions that are not notionalized (193% long) and our short positions that are not notionalized (11% short), each 1% change in exposure as a result of purchases or sales (assuming no change in value) would have a 1% impact on our cash and cash equivalents. Changes in exposure as a result of purchases and sales as well as adverse changes in market value would also have an effect on funds available to us pursuant to prime brokerage lines of credit.\nEnvironmental Matters\nFederal-Mogul\nFederal-Mogul believes that recorded environmental liabilities will be adequate to cover its estimated liability for its exposure in respect of such matters. In the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded by Federal-Mogul, our Automotive segment's results of operations could be materially affected. At December 31, 2015, Federal-Mogul estimates reasonably possible material additional losses, above and beyond its best estimate of required remediation costs as recorded, to approximate $44 million.\nOur consolidated impairment for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $653 million (484%) as compared to the corresponding prior year period. The increase was primarily due to impairment of goodwill by our Automotive and Energy segments of $312 million and $253 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2015. See Note 6, \"Fair Value Measurements,\" and Note 8, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net - Energy,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nvalue, Step 2 must be completed to quantify the amount of impairment. Step 2 calculates the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, of the reporting unit, from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in Step 1. The implied fair value of goodwill determined in this step is compared to the carrying value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss, equal to the difference, is recognized.\nOur consolidated restructuring costs were $84 million and $50 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which were primarily attributable to our Automotive segment in each of the respective periods as discussed below.\nThe prices of crude oil and other feedstocks and refined product prices are also affected by other factors, such as product pipeline capacity, local market conditions and the operating levels of competing refineries. Crude oil costs and the prices of refined products have historically been subject to wide fluctuations. Widespread expansion or upgrades of competitors' facilities, price volatility, international political and economic developments and other factors are likely to continue to play an important role in refining industry economics. These factors can impact, among other things, the level of inventories in the market, resulting in price volatility and a reduction in product margins. Moreover, the refining industry typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in demand for refined products, such as increases in the demand for gasoline during the summer driving season and for home heating oil during the winter, primarily in the Northeast. In addition to current market conditions, there are long-term factors that may impact the demand for refined products. These factors include mandated renewable fuels standards, proposed climate change laws and regulations, and increased mileage standards for vehicles. The petroleum business is also subject to the Renewable Fuel Standard (\"RFS\") of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"), which requires it to either blend \"renewable fuels\" with its transportation fuels or purchase renewable fuel credits, known as renewable identification numbers (\"RINs\"), in lieu of blending.\nAs further discussed below, in February 2016, ARI repaid amounts outstanding under the ARI Revolving Loans (as defined below) in full or $100 million. The contractual commitment table above excludes this transaction.\nReal Estate revenues and expenses include results from club operations, sales of residential units, and rental income and expenses, including income from financing leases. Sales of residential units are included in net sales in our consolidated financial statements. Results from club and rental operations, including financing lease income, are included in other revenues from operations in our consolidated financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold 14 commercial rental properties and Oak Harbor development and operations (which historically was operated as part of Grand Harbor), recognizing an aggregate gain of $40 million which is included in other income, net in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nExcept as described below, no provision has been made for federal, state, local or foreign income taxes on the results of operations generated by partnership activities as such taxes are the responsibility of the partners. Our corporate subsidiaries account for their income taxes under the asset and liability method.\n\nIcahn Enterprises Holdings\nWe conduct our Railcar segment through our majority ownership interests in American Railcar Industries, Inc. (\"ARI\") and American Railcar Leasing, LLC (\"ARL\").\n\nThe fertilizer business' cost of goods sold, before eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year period increased by $18 million (9%), primarily due to increased distribution costs mostly due to the increase in railcar regulatory inspections and repairs as well as increased ammonia purchases, partially offset by lower freight and pet coke expenses. The increase in railcar regulatory inspections and repairs is related to a larger portion of the fertilizer business' fleet due for regulatory inspections and related repairs during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year period.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased by $6 million (2%) compared to the prior year. The decrease in net sales was due to $4 million attributable to sales volume and $2 million attributable to foreign currency translation.\nWe conduct our Automotive segment through our majority ownership in Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation (\"Federal-Mogul\") and through our wholly owned subsidiary, IEH Auto Parts Holding LLC (\"IEH Auto\"), which acquired substantially all of the auto parts assets in the United States of Uni-Select, Inc. through an acquisition that was consummated during the second quarter of 2015. See Note 3, \"Operating Units - Automotive,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this acquisition. Intercompany transactions between Federal-Mogul and IEH Auto have been eliminated in consolidation and the discussion below is net of eliminations.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had investments with a fair market value of approximately $3.4 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, in the Investment Funds.\n (1) We consolidated Ferrous Resources effective June 1, 2015. \nAutomotive\nFor 2014, Icahn Enterprises Holdings recorded an income tax benefit of $103 million on pre-tax loss of $631 million compared to an income tax benefit of $118 million on pre-tax income of approximately $2.3 billion for 2013. Icahn Enterprises Holdings' effective income tax rate was 16.3% and (5.1)% for 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nWe are a diversified holding company owning subsidiaries currently engaged in the following continuing operating businesses: Investment, Automotive, Energy, Metals, Railcar, Gaming, Mining, Food Packaging, Real Estate and Home Fashion. We also report the results of our Holding Company, which includes the results of certain subsidiaries of Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings (unless otherwise noted), and investment activity and expenses associated with the Holding Company.\nOn July 28, 2015, ARI's board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of its outstanding common stock (\"ARI Stock Repurchase Program\"). The ARI Stock Repurchase Program will end upon the earlier of the date on which it is terminated by ARI's board of directors or when all authorized repurchases are completed. The timing and amount of stock repurchases, if any, will be determined based upon ARI's evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The ARI Stock Repurchase Program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time and ARI has no obligation to repurchase any amount of its common stock under the ARI Stock Repurchase Program. Under the ARI Stock Repurchase Program, ARI repurchased shares of its common stock during the year ended December 31, 2015 at a cost of approximately $57 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, ARI repurchased additional shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $5 million.\nInvesting Activities\nAutomotive\nNet sales in the Motorparts business increased by $281 million primarily due to the Affinia chassis and the Honeywell brake component acquisitions. Including the impact of sales from acquisitions, the Motorparts business' sales in North America, EMEA and ROW grew by 3.0%, 5.0% and 1.1%, respectively.\nCVR divides the petroleum business and the nitrogen fertilizer business' capital spending needs into two categories: maintenance and growth. Maintenance capital spending includes only non-discretionary maintenance projects and projects required to comply with environmental, health and safety regulations. CVR undertakes discretionary capital spending based on the expected return on incremental capital employed. Discretionary capital projects generally involve an expansion of existing capacity, improvement in product yields, and/or a reduction in direct operating expenses. Major scheduled turnaround expenses are expensed when incurred.\nMr. Icahn, along with his affiliates (excluding Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings), makes investments in the Investment Funds. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the total fair market value of investments in the Investment Funds made by Mr. Icahn and his affiliates was approximately $4.1 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively.\nForward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from trends, plans, or expectations set forth in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties may include the risks and uncertainties described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nRestructuring\nNet sales for the fertilizer business, before eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period decreased by $10 million (3%), primarily due to lower UAN sales prices and UAN sales volumes, partially offset by higher ammonia sales volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2015, CVR sold 939,547 and 32,326 tons of UAN and ammonia, respectively, with a sales price of $275 and $533 per ton, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2014, CVR sold 951,043 and 24,378 tons of UAN and ammonia, respectively, with a sales price of $288 and $536 per ton, respectively. On-stream factors (total number of hours operated divided by total hours in the reporting period) for the gasification, ammonia and UAN units were 90.2%, 87.5% and 87.3%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 96.8%, 92.6% and 92.0%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAs of December 31, 2015, CVR Refining and its subsidiaries had availability under the Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility of $290 million and had letters of credit outstanding of $28 million. Availability under the Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility was limited by borrowing base conditions as of December 31, 2015. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, CVR Partners had $25 million availability under its revolving credit facility, with an uncommitted incremental facility of up to $50 million.\nGlobal Vehicle Production Levels\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nOn July 31, 2015 Tropicana's board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $50 million of its outstanding common stock with no set expiration date (\"Tropicana Stock Repurchase Program\"). The Tropicana Stock Repurchase Program will end upon the earlier of the date on which the plan is terminated by Tropicana's board of directors or when all authorized repurchases are completed. The timing and amount of stock repurchases, if any, will be determined based upon Tropicana's evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The Tropicana Stock Repurchase Program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time and Tropicana has no obligation to repurchase any amount of its common stock under the Tropicana Stock Repurchase Program. As of the date of this Report, Tropicana has not yet repurchased any shares of its common stock under the Tropicana Stock Repurchase Program.\nCVR's Annual Report on Form 10-K contains a detailed description of its business, products, industry, operating strategy and associated risks. CVR's filings with the SEC are available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we received an aggregate of $161 million and $374 million, respectively, in dividends from CVR and distributions from CVR Refining, including one special dividend during 2014. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, CVR declared a quarterly dividend which will result in an additional $36 million in dividends and distributions paid to us in the first quarter of 2016.\nIn January, 2015, ARI refinanced its lease fleet financing facilities to, among other things, increase the aggregate borrowings thereunder. In connection with the refinancing, Longtrain Leasing III LLC (\"Longtrain Leasing III\") completed a private placement of $626 million in aggregate principal amount of notes consisting of $250 million in aggregate principal amount of its 2.98% fixed rate secured railcar equipment notes, Class A-1 (\"ARI Class A-1 Notes\") and $376 million in aggregate principal amount of its 4.06% fixed rate secured railcar equipment notes, Class A-2 (\"ARI Class A-2 Notes\", and collectively with the ARI Class A-1 Notes, the \"ARI 2015 Notes\"). Of the aggregate principal amount, $409 million was used to refinance ARI's lease fleet financing facilities, resulting in net proceeds of $212 million. The ARI 2015 Notes have a legal final maturity date of January 17, 2045 and an expected principal repayment date of January 15, 2025.\nAs we currently own approximately 82.0% of the common shares of CVR, the majority of CVR's dividend will directly upstream to us. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we received an aggregate of $161 million and $374 million, respectively, in dividends from CVR and distributions from CVR Refining. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, CVR declared a quarterly dividend which will result in an additional $36 million in dividends paid to us in the first quarter of 2016.\nGiven the global nature of our operations, we are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchanges rates. During 2015, foreign currency fluctuations had a considerable effect on our reported earnings in U.S. dollars compared to 2014.\nGross margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $155 million (15%) compared to the prior year (net of certain intercompany activity). Gross margin was 16% and 14% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The improvement in gross margin percentage over the respective periods was primarily attributable to the acquisition of IEH Auto during 2015 whose product sales margins are higher than those of Federal-Mogul's.\nThe Powertrain business' sales increase of $301 million is driven by an increase in sales volumes of $330 million, offset by customer price reductions of $29 million. This increase is attributable to higher sales volumes and market share gains across all regions of the world. Including the impact of sales from acquisitions, the Powertrain business' sales in North America, EMEA and ROW grew by 3.0%, 3.0% and 1.9%, respectively.\nNet sales for the petroleum business, before eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period decreased by $3.7 billion (42%), primarily due to significantly lower sales prices of transportation fuels and by-products. The average sales price per gallon for the year ended December 31, 2015 for gasoline and distillate decreased by approximately 36% and 42%, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year period. Overall sales volume decreased by approximately 3% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period. Sales volumes for 2015 were impacted by decreased production as a result of the major scheduled turnaround completed at the Coffeyville refinery in the fourth quarter of 2015 and lower purchased product volumes for resale. Sales volumes for 2014 were impacted by reduced crude oil throughput and production as a result of the Coffeyville refinery shutdown following the isomerization unit fire during the third quarter of 2014 and fluid catalytic cracking unit (\"FCCU\") outage at the Wynnewood refinery during the fourth quarter of 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, CVR's petroleum business sold approximately 40.1 million and 33.1 million barrels of gasoline and distillate, respectively, with an average sales price per gallon for gasoline and distillate of $1.61 and $1.62, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2014, CVR's petroleum business sold approximately 40.3 million and 34.9 million barrels of gasoline and distillate, respectively, with an average sales price per gallon for gasoline and distillate of $2.53 and $2.81, respectively.\nImpairment\nIncome Tax Expense\nFerrous shipments decreased by 235,000 gross tons (16%) while average pricing was $4 per gross ton (1%) higher during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the prior year period. The volume decrease was largely attributable to raw material shortages and transportation problems caused by severe weather conditions during the first quarter of 2014, to general material supply constraints, and to a poor export market that increased competition for limited domestic demand. The increase in average pricing for 2014 as compared to the prior year period was largely driven by higher market prices (4%) for ferrous scrap during the first nine months of 2014. A $50 per gross ton market price drop in the fourth quarter of 2014 reduced the full year-over-year price differential to 1% favorable. Non-ferrous shipment volumes decreased by 83,128,000 pounds (36%),\nThe following table sets forth performance information for the Investment Funds for the comparative periods presented. These returns represent a weighted-average composite of the average returns, net of expenses for the Investment Funds.\nFor 2014, Icahn Enterprises recorded an income tax benefit of $103 million on pre-tax loss of $632 million compared to an income tax benefit of $118 million on pre-tax income of approximately $2.3 billion for 2013. Icahn Enterprises' effective income tax rate was 16.3% and 5.1% for 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n\nCost of goods sold for the petroleum business includes cost of crude oil, other feedstocks and blendstocks, purchased products for resale, RINs, transportation distribution costs, costs associated with the operations of CVR's refineries (such costs are collectively referred to as \"direct operating expenses\") such as energy and utility costs, property taxes, catalyst and chemical costs, repairs and maintenance and labor and environmental compliance costs. In addition, cost of goods sold includes depreciation and amortization.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Updates\nThe reporting unit fair values of our reporting segments are based upon consideration of various valuation methodologies, one of which is projecting future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the risks involved ( Discounted Cash Flow\u201d or DCF\u201d). Assumptions used in a DCF require the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about appropriate discount rates and terminal values, growth rates, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The forecasted cash flows are based on current plans and for years beyond that plan, the estimates are based on assumed growth rates. We believe that our assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses. The discount rates, which are intended to reflect the risks inherent in future cash flow projections, used in a DCF are based on estimates of the weighted-average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) of a market participant. Such estimates are derived from our analysis of peer companies and consider the industry weighted average return on debt and equity from a market participant perspective.\nNet revenues from Tropicana AC comprised approximately 40% of our Gaming segment's net revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Net revenue for Tropicana AC increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period primarily due to increased customer volumes due, in part, to the closure of four competitors in Atlantic City in 2014. Based on market data, the Atlantic City market experienced year-over-year declines in casino revenue of 6.5% in the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year period; however, a comparison of year-over-year results for the remaining eight properties shows a 3.1% increase in total casino revenue in 2015 as compared to 2014. In addition, Tropicana AC casino revenues increased due to an increase in Internet gaming, coupled with 3.6% higher slot volumes, a 7.7% increase in table games volumes and a 9.4% decrease in the amount of promotional slot play redeemed, partially offset by a 1.1 percentage point decrease in the table hold percentage for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014.\nPowertrain and Motorparts are our only Automotive segment reporting units with goodwill allocated to it. While the fair value of our Automotive segment's Powertrain reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value, the Motorparts reporting unit failed \"Step 1\" of the goodwill impairment analysis. Based on \"Step 2\" of the goodwill impairment analysis of our Automotive segment's Motorparts reporting unit, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $312 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Due to the complexity in \"Step 2\" goodwill impairment test, we expect to finalize the assessment of our Automotive segment's goodwill impairment during the first quarter of 2016 and any resulting difference in the amount of the impairment will be adjusted at that time.\nDuring 2015, we paid dividends and distributions of $252 million to non-controlling interests in certain of our subsidiaries within our Energy and Railcar segments, as well as aggregate distributions to our general partner and LP unitholders of $116 million.\nThe IEH Auto acquisition contributed $396 million in net sales for the period June 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015. IEH Auto is a service organization engaged in the distribution of automotive aftermarket parts. Through its locations, IEH Auto sells predominantly to commercial aftermarket customers in the \"do-it-for-me\" market as well as \"do-it-yourself\" customers.\nSee Note 10, Debt - Automotive,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding Federal-Mogul's credit facilities.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nIn connection with recording a goodwill impairment charge of $253 million, representing the full amount of the remaining goodwill allocated to our Energy segment's Fertilizer reporting unit, we also performed an impairment test for long-lived assets for our Energy segment's fertilizer business, including finite-lived intangible assets, utilizing estimates of undiscounted future cash flows based on the use of the assets for their remaining useful life for our Energy segment's fertilizer business. The impairment test did not result in the impairment of any long-lived assets for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nEnergy\nConsolidated interest expense for Icahn Enterprises increased by $307 million (36%) during 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period. The increase for Icahn Enterprises Holdings was $307 million (36%). The increases were primarily due to higher interest expense from our Investment segment attributable to due to broker balances, higher interest expense from our Automotive segment due to higher outstanding debt balances on its revolver facility coupled with higher interest rates following the refinancing of its term loans and higher interest expense from our Railcar segments due to higher outstanding debt balances.\nOverview\nRailcar leasing revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year period due to an increase in number of railcars leased to customers and an increase in the average lease rate. Total railcars on lease at the end of 2014 were approximately 39,700 as compared to approximately 34,700 at the end of 2013.\nReturns\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Among others, estimates are used when accounting for valuation of investments and pension expense. Estimates used in determining fair value measurements include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flow assumptions, market rate assumptions for contractual obligations, actuarial assumptions for benefit plans, settlement plans for litigation and contingencies, and appropriate discount rates. Estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ from estimates.\nConsolidated Financial Results\nConsolidated net sales increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year by $472 million (6%) (net of certain intercompany activity), of which $396 million is attributable to the acquisition of IEH Auto during 2015 and $76 million is attributable to Federal-Mogul.\nDuring 2015, Mr. Icahn and his affiliates elected to receive a majority of their proportionate share of these distributions in depositary units. Mr. Icahn and his affiliates owned approximately 89.0% of Icahn Enterprises' outstanding depositary units as of December 31, 2015. Mr. Icahn and his affiliates have indicated that it is their present intention to elect to continue to receive the increase in Icahn Enterprises' cash distribution in additional depositary units for the foreseeable future.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, which amends FASB ASC Topic 810, Consolidations. This ASU amends the current consolidation guidance, including introducing a separate consolidation analysis specific to limited partnerships and other similar entities. This ASU requires that limited partnerships and similar legal entities provide partners with either substantive kick-out rights or substantive participating rights over the general partner in order to be considered a voting interest entity. The specialized consolidation model and guidance for limited partnerships and similar legal entities have been eliminated. There is no longer a presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership. For limited partnerships and similar legal entities that qualify as voting interest entities, a limited partner with a controlling financial interest should consolidate a limited partnership. A controlling financial interest may be achieved through holding a limited partner interest that provides substantive kick-out rights. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We believe that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and disclosures.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nFederal-Mogul has approved and initiated restructuring activities as a part of a broader initiative to improve operating performance and reduce costs. As such, Federal-Mogul will continue to evaluate its activities and opportunities to align its business with its executive management's strategy. Restructuring expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily related to EMEA locations and aimed to reduce production complexities and reducing inefficiencies in indirect and fixed cost structures. Federal-Mogul expects to complete these programs in 2017 and incur additional restructuring charges of approximately $10 million. For programs previously initiated, Federal-Mogul expects to complete these programs in 2018 and incur additional restructuring charges of approximately $10 million.\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, which amends FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. This ASU requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in FASB ASC Topic 718 as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. We believe that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and disclosures.\nFor 2014, Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings recognized a deferred tax benefit on its pre-tax loss primarily due to income tax benefits recorded on a release of valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets in our Gaming segment of $196 million.\nRecent Decline In Oil Prices\nTotal manufacturing revenues, before elimination of railcar sales to our Railcar segment's leasing operations, for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $1 million as compared to the corresponding prior year period. Although there was a higher volume of shipments in 2015 compared to 2014, there was a higher mix of hopper railcars in 2015, which generally sell at lower prices than tank railcars due to less material and labor content. Manufacturing revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 include revenues of $579 million relating to railcars built for our Railcar segment's leasing operations, compared to $641 million for the comparable prior year period.\nAssumptions used to calculate benefit obligations as of the end of a fiscal year directly affect the expense to be recognized in future periods. The primary assumptions affecting our accounting for employee benefits as of December 31, 2015 are as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2015 IEH Auto was in compliance with the covenants of the IEH Auto ABL Facility. See Note 10, \"Debt - Automotive,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding this credit facility.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nCurrent economic conditions continue to adversely impact Tropicana and the gaming industry as a whole. Tropicana believes its guests have reduced their discretionary spending as a result of uncertainty and instability relating to employment and the investment and housing markets. While general economic conditions have modestly improved, we cannot assure that they will continue to improve or will not worsen in the future.\nFederal-Mogul and Viskase did not record taxes on its undistributed earnings of $879 million and $66 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015, since these earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. If at some future date, these earnings cease to be permanently reinvested, Federal-Mogul and Viskase may be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on such amounts. Determining the unrecognized deferred tax liability on the potential distribution of these earnings is not practicable as such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing when remittance occurs.\n \u2022 Health care cost trend: For post-employment health care plan accounting, Federal-Mogul reviews external data and company specific historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate. The assumed health care cost trend rate used to measure next year's post-employment health care benefits is 6.97% for both health care drug costs, both declining to an ultimate trend rate of 5.00% in 2022. \nMining\nOur Food Packaging segment estimates that its capital expenditures for 2016 will be approximately $22 million.\nFerrous shipments decreased by 359,000 gross tons (30%) and average pricing decreased by $138 per gross ton (37%) for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year. The shipment decrease was attributable to reduced demand from domestic steel mills, low iron ore pricing, low export demand drawing coastal scrap into the areas where PSC Metals operates, and to the negative impact of extremely low market prices on the availability of feedstock. Ferrous market prices at the end of 2015 were at the lowest levels seen since early 2009, during the great recession. Non-ferrous shipment volumes decreased by 29,504,000 pounds (20%) and average selling prices decreased by $0.17 per pound (20%), primarily driven by the effects of steep market price declines in 2015. Shipments from an aluminum ingot tolling operation, closed at the end of March 2014, accounted for 24% of the year on year volume decrease for non-ferrous shipments.\nThe business of WestPoint Home LLC (\"WPH\") is significantly influenced by the overall economic environment, including consumer spending, at the retail level, for home textile products. Many of the larger retailers are customers of WPH. WPH will continue to realign its manufacturing operations and streamline its merchandising, sales and customer service divisions to improve its cost structure and better serve its customers. Given the uncertainty and volatility in the macroeconomic conditions, we cannot predict if WPH's financial performance will continue to improve.\nWe are a holding company. Our cash flow and our ability to meet our debt service obligations and make distributions with respect to depositary units likely will depend on the cash flow resulting from divestitures, equity and debt financings, interest income, returns on our interests in the Investment Funds and the payment of funds to us by our subsidiaries in the form of loans, dividends and distributions. We may pursue various means to raise cash from our subsidiaries. To date, such means include receipt of dividends and distributions from subsidiaries, obtaining loans or other financings based on the asset values of subsidiaries, or selling debt or equity securities of subsidiaries through capital markets transactions. To the degree any distributions and transfers are impaired or prohibited, our ability to make payments on our debt or distributions on our depositary units could be limited. The operating results of our subsidiaries may not be sufficient for them to make distributions to us. In addition, our subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to us, and distributions and intercompany transfers from our subsidiaries to us may be restricted by applicable law or covenants contained in debt agreements and other agreements.\nFor 2015, Icahn Enterprises Holdings recorded an income tax expense of $68 million on pre-tax loss of $2.1 billion compared to an income tax benefit of $103 million on pre-tax loss of $631 million for 2014. Icahn Enterprises Holdings effective income tax rate was (3.3)% and 16.3% for 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n\nConsolidated Cash Flows\nThe declaration and payment of distributions is reviewed quarterly by Icahn Enterprises GP's board of directors based upon a review of our balance sheet and cash flow, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities, our expected capital and liquidity requirements, the provisions of our partnership agreement and provisions in our financing arrangements governing distributions, and keeping in mind that limited partners subject to U.S. federal income tax have recognized income on our earnings even if they do not receive distributions that could be used to satisfy any resulting tax obligations. The payment of future distributions will be determined by the board of directors quarterly, based upon the factors described above and other factors that it deems relevant at the time that declaration of a distribution is considered. Payments of distributions are subject to certain restrictions, including certain restrictions on our subsidiaries which limit their ability to distribute dividends to us. There can be no assurance as to whether or in what amounts any future distributions might be paid.\nIt is impossible to predict precisely what effect these laws and regulations will have on our operations in the future. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may result in, among other things, capital expenditures, costs and liabilities. Management believes, based on past experience and its best assessment of future events, that these environmental liabilities and costs will be assessed and paid over an extended period of time. Management believes that recorded environmental liabilities will be adequate to cover estimated liability for exposure in respect to such matters. In the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded, our results of operations could be materially affected.\nOther Consolidated Results of Operations\nOur consolidated restructuring costs were $97 million and $84 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which were primarily attributable to our Automotive segment in each of the respective periods as discussed below.\nDue to the nature of certain of our operations, we may be subject to environmental remediation claims. Certain of our operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning discharges to the air, soil, surface and subsurface waters and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials and hazardous substances. Certain of our operations are also subject to other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations including those that require them to remove or mitigate the effects of the disposal or release of certain materials at\nThe fair value of our Energy segment's reporting unit is based upon consideration of various valuation methodologies, including a DCF analysis and pricing multiples of current and future earnings observed for comparable public companies. Assumptions used in a DCF require the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about appropriate discount rates and terminal values, growth rates, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The forecasted cash flows are based on current plans and for years beyond that plan, and the estimates are based on assumed growth rates. We believe that our assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses. The discount rates, which are intended to reflect the risks inherent in future cash flow projections, used in a DCF are based on estimates of the weighted-average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) of a market participant. Such estimates are derived from our analysis of peer companies and consider the industry weighted average return on debt and equity from a market participant perspective.\nOur Investment segment had net cash used in operating activities of $136 million primarily relating to its investment transactions. Additionally, our Holding Company had net cash used in operating activities of $270 million primarily due to payments of interest expense on its debt.\nThe consolidated cash flows of Icahn Enterprises Holdings and Icahn Enterprises are substantially the same. The minor differences between Icahn Enterprises Holdings' and Icahn Enterprises' consolidated statements of cash flows primarily relate to non-cash charges for interest expense which is presented in net cash flows used in operating activities. Therefore, we discuss only the consolidated cash flows of Icahn Enterprises below.\nInterest Expense\nNet cash used in investing activities for 2015 was primarily due to consolidated capital expenditures incurred by our subsidiaries and acquisitions of business. Our Railcar segment had capital expenditures of $522 million, of which $484 million was for the manufacturing or purchase of railcars for its leasing operations. Additionally, our Automotive and Energy segments had capital expenditures of $449 million and $219 million, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nMajor Influences Impacting Results of Operations\nGross margin from manufacturing operations, before eliminations relating to railcar sales to our Railcar segment's leasing operations, for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $271 million compared to $197 million for the comparable prior year period. Gross margin from manufacturing operations as a percentage of manufacturing revenues increased to 27% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 23% for the comparable prior year period. The improved margin was primarily due to ramped up production at our Railcar segment's hopper railcar manufacturing facility that created operating efficiencies and leveraged overhead costs. This was in addition to efficiencies that our Railcar segment continued to generate at its tank railcar manufacturing facility due to high production volumes.\nThe following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our present business and the results of operations together with our present financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (this \"Report\").\nOur operating businesses are managed on a decentralized basis. Due to the structure of our business, we discuss the results of operations below by individual reportable segments. Refer to Note 3, Operating Units,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements for a description of each of our reporting segments and Note 13, \"Segment and Geographic Reporting,\" for a reconciliation of each of our reporting segment's results of operations to our consolidated results.\n\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which amends FASB ASC Subtopic 835-30, Interest - Imputation of Interest. The new standard requires that all costs incurred to issue debt be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the debt. Given the absence of authoritative guidance within this ASU regarding debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit, the SEC staff has stated that it would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement. The standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and is required to be applied on a retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. We expect that the adoption of this new guidance will generally result in a reclassification of debt issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheets.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nRefining margin per barrel of crude oil throughput increased to $14.45 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $11.38 for the corresponding prior year period. Refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact increased to $15.31 per crude oil throughput barrel for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $13.62 per crude oil throughput barrel for the corresponding prior year period. Gross margin per barrel increased to $5.78 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to gross margin per barrel of $3.42 in the corresponding prior year period. The increase in refining margin and gross margin per barrel was primarily due to the higher unfavorable FIFO impact in 2014 as a result of significant decline in the market price of crude oil.\nOn February 11, 2013, we announced that the board of directors of our general partner approved a modification to our distribution policy to provide for an increase in the annual distribution from $1.40, comprised of $0.40 in cash and $1.00 in depositary units, to $4.00 per depositary unit, payable in either cash or additional depositary units, at the election of each\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nOn November 25, 2015, IEH Auto entered into a senior secured asset based revolving credit facility (the \"IEH Auto ABL Credit Facility\") for $125 million. On January 25, 2016, the ABL Credit Facility was amended and restated to increase the revolver commitments to $210 million. As of December 31, 2015, the IEH Auto ABL Facility had a balance of $75 million and $3 million in letters of credit. As of December 31, 2015, the availability on the IEH Auto ABL Credit Facility was $30 million.", "item_7_text": "various sites. While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions, if any, management uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that it will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, management makes estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries, if any. Certain of our operations accrue a liability when their management believes a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that have previously been made.\n\nPending Mergers\nIn December 2015, ARI completed a financing of its railcar lease fleet with availability of up to $200 million under a credit agreement (\"2015 ARI Credit Agreement\"). The 2015 ARI Credit Agreement contains an incremental borrowing provision under which ARI, as debtor and subject to the conditions set forth in the credit agreement, has the right but not the obligation to increase the amount of the facility in an aggregate amount of up to $100 million (the amounts extended under the 2015 ARI Credit Agreement, inclusive of any amounts extended under the incremental facility, the ARI Revolving Loans\u201d), to a maximum principal amount of $300 million. ARI may use the proceeds of the ARI Revolving Loans to finance the manufacturing of railcars on an ongoing basis, to pay related transaction costs, fees and expenses in connection with the 2015 ARI Credit Agreement, to finance ongoing working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. The initial ARI Revolving Loan obtained at closing amounted to approximately $100 million, net of fees and expenses. In February 2016,\nFederal-Mogul has identified sites with contractual obligations and several sites that are closed or expected to be closed and sold. In connection with these sites, Federal-Mogul has accrued $16 million and $24 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for ARO's, primarily related to anticipated costs of removing hazardous building materials at its facilities, and has considered impairment issues that may result from capitalization of these ARO amounts.\nOverview\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nNet loss from investment activities was $137 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $158 million for the corresponding prior year period. The net loss from investment activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 include realized and unrealized losses from certain derivative swaps that were assigned to the Holding Company from the Investment segment during August 2013. These derivative swaps were closed out during 2014. See Note 7, \"Financial Instruments - Investment Segment and Holding Company,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. In addition, there were unrealized losses related to other securities held by the Holding Company.\nResults of Operations\nCost of goods sold for the petroleum business includes cost of crude oil, other feedstocks and blendstocks, purchased products for resale, RINs, transportation distribution costs, costs associated with the operations of CVR's refineries (such costs are collectively referred to as \"direct operating expenses\") such as energy and utility costs, property taxes, catalyst and chemical costs, repairs and maintenance and labor and environmental compliance costs. In addition, cost of goods sold includes depreciation and amortization.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nIcahn Enterprises L.P. ( Icahn Enterprises\u201d) is a master limited partnership formed in Delaware on February 17, 1987. Icahn Enterprises Holdings L.P. ( Icahn Enterprises Holdings\u201d) is a limited partnership formed in Delaware on February 17, 1987. References to \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us\" herein include both Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings and their subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.\nNet sales for 2014 decreased by $8 million (4%) compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily due to reduction in sales volume in certain low margin programs. Cost of goods sold for 2014 decreased by $9 million (6%) compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume. Gross margin for 2014 increased by $1 million (4%) compared to 2013. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 14% for 2014 as compared to 12% for 2013. The improvement was primarily due to higher margins on more profitable programs and customers.\nAs further discussed in Note 3, \"Operating Units - Energy,\" on August 9, 2015, CVR Partners entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Rentech Nitrogen Partners, L.P. (\"Rentech Nitrogen\") and Rentech Nitrogen GP, LLC (\"Rentech Nitrogen GP\"), pursuant to which CVR Partners would acquire Rentech Nitrogen and Rentech Nitrogen GP by merging two newly-created direct wholly owned subsidiaries of CVR Partners with and into those entities with Rentech Nitrogen and Rentech Nitrogen GP continuing as surviving entities and wholly owned subsidiaries of CVR Partners (together, the \"CVR Partners Mergers\"). In accordance with US GAAP, our Energy segment anticipates accounting for the CVR Partners Mergers as an acquisition of a business with CVR Partners as the acquirer. The completion of the CVR Partners Mergers is subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions.\nTotal environmental liabilities, determined on an undiscounted basis, were $14 million and $15 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe cost of RINs for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was approximately $124 million, $127 million and $181 million, respectively. The price of RINs has been extremely volatile and has increased over the last year. The future cost of RINs for the petroleum business is difficult to estimate. Additionally, the cost of RINs is dependent upon a variety of factors, which include the availability of RINs for purchase, the price at which RINs can be purchased, transportation fuel production levels, the mix of the petroleum business' petroleum products, as well as the fuel blending performed at its refineries and downstream terminals, all of which can vary significantly from period to period. Based upon recent market prices of RINs and current estimates related to the other variable factors, the petroleum business estimates that the total cost of RINs will be approximately $140 million to $190 million for the year ending December 31, 2016.\n \u2022 Mortality Assumptions: Federal-Mogul has reviewed the mortality improvement tables published by the Society of Actuaries in the three months ended December 31, 2015 and determined its current assumptions are appropriate to measure its U.S. pension plans' benefit obligations as of December 31, 2015.  Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations. The effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to expense over future periods. The unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss on Federal-Mogul's pension plans was $587 million and $685 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The change is due primarily to the increase in discount rates partially offset by actual asset returns being less than assumed returns.\nContractual Commitments and Contingencies\nOn January 24, 2013, the board of directors of CVR adopted a quarterly cash dividend policy. CVR began paying regular quarterly dividends in the second quarter of 2013. Dividends are subject to change at the discretion of CVR's board of directors and may change from quarter to quarter. In addition, the current policy of the respective board of directors of CVR Refining and CVR Partners is to distribute all of the respective available cash of CVR Refining and CVR Partners each quarter. CVR Refining and CVR Partners do not have a legal obligation to pay distributions and there is no guarantee that they will pay any distributions on the units in any quarter.\nThe earnings and cash flows of our Energy segment's petroleum business are primarily affected by the relationship between refined product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks that are processed and blended into refined products. The cost to acquire crude oil and other feedstocks and the price for which refined products are ultimately sold depend\n \u2022 Discount rate: The discount rate reflects the effective yield on high quality fixed income securities available in the marketplace as of the measurement date to settle pension and post-employment benefit obligations. The weighted-average discount rate used to calculate net periodic pension cost is 3.85% for U.S. pension plans and a weighted \nRevenues from rooms increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year period, primarily due to the acquisition of Lumi\u00e8re in April 2014. The average daily room rate and occupancy rate across all of Tropicana's gaming properties were $79 and 66%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $69 and 60%, respectively, for the comparable prior year period.\nCVR is a diversified holding company primarily engaged in the petroleum refining and nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing industries through its holdings in CVR Refining, LP ( CVR Refining\u201d) and CVR Partners, LP ( CVR Partners\u201d), respectively. CVR Refining is an independent petroleum refiner and marketer of high value transportation fuels. CVR Partners produces nitrogen fertilizers in the form of urea ammonium nitrate (\"UAN\") and ammonia. As of December 31, 2015, CVR owned 100% of the general partners of CVR Refining and CVR Partners and approximately 66% of the outstanding common units of CVR Refining and 53% of the outstanding common units of CVR Partners. Subsequent to the completion of the pending mergers as discussed below, it is estimated that CVR will hold approximately 34% of the outstanding common units of CVR Partners and 100% of the general partner interest.\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for projected benefit obligations ( PBO\u201d), associated expense and other comprehensive loss. The changes in these assumptions have no impact on Federal-Mogul's funding requirements.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, based on certain negative trends occurring in the energy markets, particularly with respect to the significant volatility in the oil markets as a result of a drop in forecasted worldwide demand for crude oil supply and inventories, we determined that goodwill impairment indicators existed in both of our Energy segment's Petroleum and Fertilizer reporting units. Accordingly, we performed a \"Step 1\" goodwill impairment analysis for our Energy segment's reporting units as of December 1, 2014. Our Energy segment's petroleum reporting unit passed Step 1\u201d of the goodwill impairment analysis, and therefore, we did not perform Step 2\u201d of the goodwill impairment analysis for this reporting unit. Because our Energy segment's Fertilizer reporting unit failed \"Step 1\" of the goodwill impairment analysis, we performed \"Step 2\" of the goodwill impairment analysis. Based on \"Step 2\" results of the goodwill impairment analysis, we recognized a preliminary impairment charge of $103 million for our Energy segment's Fertilizer reporting unit for the year ended December 31, 2014. Due to the complexity of the \"Step 2\" goodwill impairment test, we finalized the assessment of our Energy segment's goodwill impairment during the first quarter of 2015 and noted that no additional adjustments to goodwill were required for the first quarter of 2015.\nDecember 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this ASU should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. We anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have minimal impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and disclosures.\nThe fertilizer business' cost of goods sold, before eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period decreased by $3 million (1%), primarily due to lower consumption of pet coke mostly due to the decrease in production during the turnaround and the Linde air separation unit related downtime, lower pet coke pricing, decreased distribution costs, freight expenses and purchased ammonia.\nDuring the period June 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, our Mining segment sold approximately 2 million metric tons of iron, of which approximately 1.8 million metric tons were sold to a single customer, a Brazilian multinational diversified metals and mining corporation and one of the largest logistics operators in Brazil. The average sales price for the period June 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015 was $17.25 per metric ton. Our Mining segment continues to evaluate the best alternatives to sell its products in light of the challenging markets for iron ore.\nCasino revenues are one of Tropicana's main performance indicators and account for a significant portion of its net revenues. The increase in casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period was primarily due to an increase in consolidated gaming volumes of 3.8%, primarily due to the Lumi\u00e8re acquisition on April 1, 2014, coupled with higher gaming volumes at Tropicana Casino and Resort, Atlantic City (\"Tropicana AC\"). Tropicana's slot hold percentage was 9.6% and 9.5% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Tropicana's table game hold percentage was 16.8% and 17.6% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments, which amends FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. This ASU eliminates the requirement to retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition dates of business combinations. Rather, this ASU requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after\nCasino revenues are one of Tropicana's main performance indicators and account for a significant portion of its net revenues. The increase in casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the comparable prior year period was primarily due to an increase in consolidated gaming volumes of 25.9%, primarily due to the Lumi\u00e8re acquisition on April 1, 2014, coupled with higher gaming volumes at Tropicana AC. Tropicana's slot hold percentage was 9.5% and 9.4% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Tropicana's table game hold percentage was 17.6% and 14.2% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nValuation of Investments\nEnergy\nOur consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $283 million (17%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $70 million from our Investment segment was largely attributable to higher compensation expense related to certain investment related performance, an increase of $176 million from our Automotive segment primarily due to the inclusion of the acquisition of Affinia Group Inc., the acquisition of certain business assets of Honeywell International Inc., and the IEH Auto acquisition, an increase of $11 million from our Gaming segment primarily due to the inclusion of the Lumi\u00e8re acquisition, and an increase of $12 million from our Mining segment primarily due to the inclusion of the acquisition of Ferrous Resources effective June 1, 2015. In addition, there was a a net increase in our other segments and Holding Company of $14 million.\nCertain of PSC Metals' and Federal-Mogul's facilities are environmentally impaired. PSC Metals and Federal-Mogul have estimated their liability to remediate these sites to be $29 million and $14 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015. Additionally, Federal-Mogul has identified sites with contractual obligations and sites that are closed or expected to be closed\nFood Packaging\nBorrowings\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Investment Funds' net notional exposure was -25%. The Investment Funds' long exposure was 199% (193% long equity and 6% long credit) and the Investment Funds' short exposure was 224% (184% short equity and 40% short credit and other short exposure). The notional exposure represents the ratio of the notional exposure of the Investment Funds' invested capital to the net asset value of the Investment Funds at December 31, 2015.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we owned 82.0% of the total outstanding common stock of CVR. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings directly owned approximately 4.0% of the total outstanding common stock of CVR Refining.\nFederal-Mogul estimates its 2016 capital expenditures to be in the range of $390 million to $440 million.\nInvestment\nFederal-Mogul operates with two end-customer focused businesses. The Powertrain business focuses on original equipment products for automotive, heavy duty and industrial applications. Powertrain operates manufacturing facilities in 19 countries and derived 35% of its 2015 OE sales in North America, 46% in Europe, the Middle-East and Africa (\"EMEA\"), and 19% in the rest of the world (\"ROW\"). The Motorparts business sells and distributes a broad portfolio of products in the global aftermarket, while also serving original equipment manufacturers with products including braking, chassis, wipers, and other vehicle components. Motorparts operates manufacturing sites in 15 countries and distribution centers and warehouses in 14 countries. Motorparts derived 56% of its sales through North America, 37% in EMEA, and 7% in ROW.\nAs of December 31, 2015, based on covenants in the indenture governing our senior notes, we are unable to incur additional indebtedness. See Note 10, Debt,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning credit facilities for us and our subsidiaries.\nThe following table summarizes total revenues, net (loss) income and net (loss) income attributable to Icahn Enterprises for each of our reporting segments and our Holding Company for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nConsolidated net sales increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 by $412 million (6%) as compared to the corresponding prior year period. Excluding dispositions of $119 million and unfavorable foreign currency impacts of $51 million, sales organically increased by $582 million or 9% on a constant dollar basis. This increase is driven by sales growth in the Powertrain business of $301 million (8%) and an increase in sales in the Motorparts business of $281 million (10%), driven by the Affinia chassis and the Honeywell brake component business acquisitions.\nThe fair value of our investments, including securities sold, not yet purchased, is based on observable market prices when available. Securities owned by the Investment Funds that are listed on a securities exchange are valued at their last sales price on the primary securities exchange on which such securities are traded on such date. Securities that are not listed on any exchange but are traded over-the-counter are valued at the mean between the last bid\u201d and ask\u201d price for such security on such date. Securities and other instruments for which market quotes are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the applicable general partner. For some investments little market activity may exist; management's determination of fair value is then based on the best information available in the circumstances and may incorporate management's own assumptions and involves a significant degree of management's judgment.\nGlobal Vehicle Sales Levels\n\nAs discussed above, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $312 million for our Automotive segment's Motorparts reporting unit during the year ended December 31, 2015. As a result, there was $349 million of goodwill remaining in our Automotive segment's Motorparts reporting unit at December 31, 2015. Moreover, as a result of our recoverability analysis, there were no indications of impairment related to long-lived assets for our Automotive segment's Motorparts reporting unit.\nDiscussion of Segment Liquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2015, our Railcar segment had a backlog of approximately 7,080 railcars, including approximately 1,450 railcars for lease customers as compared to a backlog of approximately 11,730 railcars as of December 31, 2014, including approximately 4,910 railcars for lease customers.\nThe following table summarizes cash flow information for the year ended December 31, 2015 and cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2015 for each of Icahn Enterprises' operating segments and the Holding Company:\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $375 million (6%) as compared to the corresponding prior year period. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to acquisitions.\nPension Plans and Other Post-employment Benefit Plans\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which amends FASB ASC Topic 330, Inventory. This ASU requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value and eliminates the option that currently exists for measuring inventory at market value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. This ASU should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim period or annual reporting period. We anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have minimal impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and disclosures.\nHolding Company\nEnergy\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nDecember 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and disclosures.\nOperating Activities\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $12 million (4%) as compared to the prior year. The decrease in cost of goods sold was due to foreign currency translation, lower raw material costs and plant efficiencies, offset in part by higher sales volumes and higher pension expense. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 24% and 25% for 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-06, Effects on Historical Earnings per Unit of Master Limited Partnership Dropdown Transactions, which amends FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. This ASU requires that for purposes of calculating earnings per share under the two-class method, the earnings or losses of a transferred business before the date of a dropdown transaction should be allocated entirely to the general partner. In that circumstance, the previously reported earnings per unit of the limited partners would not change as a result of the drop down transaction. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is permitted. The adoption of this guidance will have no impact on our consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures as we have historically allocated earnings or losses of a transferred business before the date of applicable dropdown transactions to the general partner for purposes of calculating earnings per share.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Federal-Mogul had $194 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which $95 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") ASC 740-30-25-17 through 19, Federal-Mogul asserts that these funds are indefinitely reinvested due to operational and investing needs of the foreign locations. Furthermore, Federal-Mogul will accrue any applicable taxes in the period when it no longer intends to indefinitely reinvest these funds. Federal-Mogul would expect that the impact on cash taxes would be immaterial due to: the availability of net operation loss carryforwards and related valuation allowances; earnings considered previously taxed; and applicable tax treaties.\nOur consolidated other income (loss), net for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $182 million and $21 million, respectively. Equity earnings from non-consolidated affiliates, primarily from our Automotive segment, were $50 million and $26 million the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition, our Energy segment recorded gains on certain derivative contracts of $186 million and $57 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Included in our consolidated other income (loss), net was a loss on extinguishment of debt of $162 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. See Note 7, \"Financial Instruments,\" and Note 16, \"Other Income, Net,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\n\nRevenues from rooms increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period, primarily due to the acquisition of Lumi\u00e8re in April 2014, coupled with higher occupancy and average daily room rate at Tropicana AC, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from rooms as a result of the sale of the River Palms property in 2014. The average daily room rate and occupancy rate across all of Tropicana's gaming properties were $85 and 70%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $79 and 66%, respectively, for the comparable prior year period.\nGlobal vehicle production increased by 1.3% in 2015. European vehicle production rose 4.1% from 2014 levels. North American vehicle production increased 3.6%, with positive growth in Mexico and the United States. Vehicle production in the Asia-Pacific region increased just under 1% in 2015, reaching another record high. Among the major regions, only South America posted a decline in 2015, down 19.3%.\nOf our short exposure of 224%, the fair value of our short positions represented 11% of our short exposure. The notional value of our short derivative positions, which primarily included short broad market credit default swap contracts and short broad market index swap derivative positions, represented 213% of our short exposure.\nGross margin from manufacturing operations, before eliminations relating to railcar sales to our Railcar segment's leasing operations, for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased to $249 million from $271 million for the comparable prior year period. Gross margin from manufacturing operations as a percentage of manufacturing revenues decreased to 24% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 27% for the comparable prior year period. The decrease in gross margin over the respective periods was due to a higher mix of hopper railcar shipments, which generally sell at lower prices than tank railcars due to less material and labor content.\nThe strength of the aftermarket business is influenced by several key drivers. These include the vehicle population (or \"parc\"), average vehicle age, fuel prices and vehicle distance traveled. The vehicle parc is estimated to have expanded in most major markets, including the United States, Japan, China, and Germany. Average vehicle ages also increased, despite growth in new vehicle sales, in most regions.\nFederal-Mogul has also identified certain other present and former properties at which it may be responsible for cleaning up or addressing environmental contamination, in some cases as a result of contractual commitments and/or federal or state environmental laws. Federal-Mogul is actively seeking to resolve these actual and potential statutory, regulatory and contractual obligations. Although difficult to quantify based on the complexity of the issues, Federal-Mogul has accrued amounts corresponding to its best estimate of the costs associated with such regulatory and contractual obligations on the basis of available information from site investigations and best professional judgment of consultants.\nHolding Company\nimpairment during the first quarter of 2016 and any resulting difference in the amount of the impairment will be adjusted at that time.\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $21 million (6%) compared to the corresponding prior year period. The decrease in net sales was due to unfavorable foreign currency translation of $27 million, unfavorable country mix of $5 million due to sales in countries that have lower average selling price than the global sales prices, offset in part by an increase in sales volume of $11 million.\nCVR estimates that its aggregate capital spending in 2016 will be approximately $220 million.\nSee Note 10, Debt - Energy,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding CVR's credit facilities, including the Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility.\nTotal manufacturing revenues, before elimination of railcar sales to our Railcar segment's leasing operations, for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $156 million (18%) over the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to increased hopper railcar shipments and strong market conditions for tank railcars. Manufacturing revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 included revenues of $641 million relating to railcars built for our Railcar segment's leasing operations, compared to $456 million for the comparable prior year period.\nThe assumed health care trend rate has a significant impact on the amounts reported for non-pension plans. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the assumed health care trend rate:\n\nRailcar services revenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared the corresponding prior year period primarily due to certain repair projects being performed at our Railcar segment's hopper railcar manufacturing facility during 2013 that did not continue into 2014. In 2014, production of hopper railcars ramped up due to increased demand, thus these repair projects were no longer being performed at our Railcar segment's manufacturing facilities.\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $322 million (44%) compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower shipment volumes and lower material and processing costs. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was a loss of 12% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to a loss of 2% for the prior year period. While material margin component of the gross margin improved during 2015 as compared to 2014, processing costs, as a percentage of net sales, increased over the respective periods. The improvement in material margin component of the gross margin reflected improved buying efforts despite the unfavorable impact of increased competition for shredder feedstock and lower pricing for non-ferrous auto shredder residue. Processing costs, as a percentage of net sales, increased due to decreases in sales volumes and market prices over the respective periods. PSC Metals continues to expend considerable effort to bring costs in line with lower volumes and market pricing. During 2015 PSC Metals closed nine feeder yards in order to better align its cost structure with the current economic climate.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of our Energy segment's petroleum business' gross margin to refining margin and refining margin adjusted for FIFO impacts for the periods indicated:\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nFood Packaging\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\naverage of 1.77% for non-U.S. plans and 3.84% for its OPEB. In calculating its benefit obligations, Federal-Mogul used a weighted-average discount rate of 4.15% for its U.S. pension plans, a weighted average discount rate of 2.72% for its non-U.S. pension plans and a discount rate of 4.18% for its OPEB.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nThe difference between the effective tax rate and statutory federal rate of 35% was principally due to partnership losses not subject to taxation.\nNet sales for 2015 increased by $17 million (10%) compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume. Cost of goods sold for 2015 increased by $11 million (7%) compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume. Gross margin for 2015 increased by $6 million (25%) compared to 2014. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 16% for 2015 as compared to 14% for 2014. The improvement was primarily due to higher margins on more profitable programs and customers.\nDebt consists of the following: \nARI repaid amounts outstanding under the ARI Revolving Loans in full and as of the date of this Report, ARI has borrowing availability of $200 million under the ARI Revolving Loans.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for 2015 of $714 million was primarily attributable to our Energy, Railcar and Gaming segments, offset in part by net cash used in operating activities attributable to our Investment segment and the Holding Company. Our Energy, Railcar and Gaming segments net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to earnings after adjusting for non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization and impairment.\nMajor Influences on Results of Operations\nThe Powertrain business generated approximately 63% of its sales outside of the United States and the resulting currency movements decreased sales by $407 million. On a constant dollar basis, Powertrain external sales increased 12% compared to the same period in 2014. The increase in Powertrain's sales reflects the inclusion of the acquisition of certain assets of the TRW engine components business, as well as increases in volume which, together, increased sales by $427 million. This figure includes the impact of customer price decreases of $28 million. Including the impact of sales from acquisitions, the Powertrain business' sales in North America, EMEA and ROW grew by 3.3%, 6.3% and 1%, respectively.\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased by $218 million (23%) compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower ferrous and non-ferrous shipment volumes and selling prices. Shipment volumes were lower in 2014 than in 2013 for all product lines except secondary plate, and average prices were lower for all product lines except brokerage.\nTropicana's Annual Report on Form 10-K contains a detailed description of its business, products, industry, operating strategy and associated risks. Tropicana's filings with the SEC are available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.\nRailcar shipments for the year ended December 31, 2015 were approximately 8,900 railcars, including approximately 5,060 railcars to leasing customers, as compared to 7,970 railcars for the prior year, of which approximately 5,230 railcars were to leasing customers. (Shipments of railcars for lease are included in manufacturing operations' net sales in the table above however they are eliminated from net sales in consolidation as they represent shipments to ARI's leasing business and ARL.)\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nDifferences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations. Actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses which are subject to amortization and expensed over future periods. The unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss on Federal-Mogul's pension plans was $532 million and $590 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Federal-Mogul expects to recognize amortization expense of $15 million in 2016.\nManagement periodically evaluates all evidence, both positive and negative, in determining whether a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets is still needed. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, we concluded, based on the projections of taxable income, that certain of our corporate subsidiaries more likely than not will realize a partial benefit from their deferred tax assets and loss carry forwards. Ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon, among other factors, our corporate subsidiaries' ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward periods and is subject to change depending on the tax laws in effect in the years in which the carryforwards are used. See Note 14, \"Income Taxes,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the reversal of our Gaming segment's deferred tax assets during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased by $10 million (4%) as compared to the prior year. While cost of goods sold decreased primarily due to lower sales volume, gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 25% and 23% for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The improvement in the gross margin as a percent of net sales over the comparable period was due to improved plant performance.\n\nThe Investment Funds' aggregate return was 30.8% for 2013 primarily due to gains in their long exposure, primarily in a few of the largest core holdings. These gains were partially offset by losses in their short equity exposure, including broad market hedges as equity markets rallied in 2013.\nFederal-Mogul is a defendant in lawsuits filed, or the recipient of administrative orders issued or demand letters received, in various jurisdictions pursuant to the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ( CERCLA\u201d) or other similar national, provincial or state environmental remedial laws. These laws provide that responsible parties may be liable to pay for remediating contamination resulting from hazardous substances that were discharged into the environment by them, by prior owners or occupants of property they currently own or operate, or by others to whom they sent such substances for treatment or other disposition at third party locations. Federal-Mogul has been notified by the EPA, other national environmental agencies, and various provincial and state agencies that it may be a potentially responsible party ( PRP\u201d) under such laws for the cost of remediating hazardous substances pursuant to CERCLA and other national and state or provincial environmental laws. PRP designation often results in the funding of site investigations and subsequent remedial activities.\nRevenues from our real estate operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are substantially derived from our club and rental operations, including the gain on sale of various properties previously leased to others. Revenues from sales of residential units in our real estate development operations represent 11% and 15% of total Real Estate revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\n\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, such as goodwill and trademarks, held by our various segments are reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. Goodwill impairment testing involves a two-step process. Step 1 compares the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no further analysis is necessary. The reporting unit fair value is based upon consideration of various valuation methodologies, including guideline transaction multiples, multiples of current earnings, and projected future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the risk involved. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair\nRailcar\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nIEH Auto is a leading automotive parts distributor for domestic and imported vehicles and has 34 distribution centers and satellite locations and 264 corporate-owned parts stores in the United States and supports a network of more than 2,000 independent parts stores. Through its locations, IEH Auto sells predominantly to commercial aftermarket customers in the do-it-for-me market as well as retail and do-it-yourself customers. IEH Auto operates independently of Federal-Mogul.\nIn November 2013, Tropicana entered into (i) a senior secured first lien term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $300 million, issued at a discount of 0.5% (the Term Loan Facility\u201d) and (ii) a senior secured first lien revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $15 million (the Revolving Facility\u201d and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the Credit Facilities\u201d). Commencing on December 31, 2013, the Term Loan Facility amortizes in equal quarterly installments in an amount of $750,000, with any remaining balance payable on November 27, 2020. Amounts under the Revolving Facility are available to be borrowed and re-borrowed until its termination on November 27, 2018. As of December 31, 2015, the Revolving Facility was undrawn and had $15 million of availability. See Note 10, \"Debt - Gaming\" in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the Credit Facilities.\nThe difference between the effective tax rate and statutory federal rate of 35% was principally due to changes in valuation allowances and partnership income not subject to taxation, as such taxes are the responsibility of the partners.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to 2013\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nFinancing Activities\nOur consolidated SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $208 million (15%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $89 million from our Gaming segment primarily due to inclusion of the Lumi\u00e8re acquisition during the second quarter of 2014, $76 million from our Automotive segment primarily due to the recognition of an OPEB curtailment gain during the second quarter of 2013 (which reduced SG&A in 2013), and the inclusion of the Affinia and Honeywell acquisitions during the second quarter and third quarter of 2014, respectively, and an increase of $48 million from our Investment segment due to higher compensation expense attributable to a certain fund performance.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for 2015 was primarily attributable to certain debt refinancing and draw down on revolver facilities at our Railcar and Automotive segments, resulting in approximately $1.0 billion in net proceeds. Additionally, our Investment segment had capital contributions of $276 million from affiliates of Mr. Icahn.\n\nThe Investment Funds' aggregate return was -7.4% for 2014, due to losses in their short equity exposure, primarily through broad market hedges, as well as other losses in long equity positions including energy. These losses were partially offset by gains in long equity positions in a few of their largest core holdings.\nRevenues from our real estate operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 are substantially derived from our club and rental operations. Revenues from sales of residential units in our real estate development operations represent 15% and less than 5% of total Real Estate revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nDerivative Instruments\nAs discussed in Note 5, Investments and Related Matters,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements, we have contractual liabilities of $794 million related to securities sold, not yet purchased as of December 31, 2015. This amount has not been included in the table above as maturity is not subject to a contract and cannot be properly estimated.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nOn January 24, 2013, the board of directors of CVR adopted a quarterly cash dividend policy. CVR began paying regular quarterly dividends in the second quarter of 2013. Dividends are subject to change at the discretion of CVR's board of directors and may change from quarter to quarter. In addition, the current policy of the respective board of directors of CVR Refining and CVR Partners is to distribute all of the respective available cash of CVR Refining and CVR Partners each quarter. CVR Refining and CVR Partners do not have a legal obligation to pay distributions and there is no guarantee that they will pay any distributions on the units in any quarter.\ndepositary unitholder. On May 29, 2013, the board of directors of our general partner further modified our distribution policy to increase our annual distribution from $4.00 per depositary unit to $5.00 per depositary unit. Further, on March 3, 2014, the board of directors of our general partner announced an increase in our annualized distribution from $5.00 per depositary unit to $6.00 per depositary unit.\nIn addition to the amounts in the table above, our Energy segment has $28 million in standby letters of credit to secure transportation services for crude oil.\nOur consolidated impairment for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $119 million (744%) as compared to the corresponding prior year period. The increase was primarily due to impairment of goodwill by our Energy segment of $103 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. See Note 6, \"Fair Value Measurements,\" and Note 8, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net - Energy,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $350 million (49%) as compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower ferrous and non-ferrous shipment volumes and selling prices.\nAutomotive\nIn order to assess the operating performance of the nitrogen fertilizer business, CVR calculates the product pricing at gate as an input to determine its operating margin. Product pricing at gate represents net sales less freight revenue divided by product sales volume in tons. CVR believes product pricing at gate is a meaningful measure because it sells products at its plant gate and terminal locations' gates (sold gate) and delivered to the customer's designated delivery site (sold delivered). The relative percentage of sold gate versus sold delivered can change period to period. The product pricing at gate provides a measure that is consistently comparable period to period.\nThe North American railcar market has been, and our Railcar segment expects it to continue to be, highly cyclical. The tank railcar market continues to soften, which we believe is driven by multiple factors including record high deliveries of tank railcars in recent years. Additionally, the recent volatility in oil prices and uncertainty surrounding the May 2015 release of regulations related to tank railcars in the U.S. and Canada have led to reduced demand for railcars in the energy transportation industry. Customers continue to weigh the costs versus benefits of investing in new tank railcars or modifying their existing tank railcars for flammable service. Our Railcar segment cannot assure you that hopper or tank railcar demand will maintain its current pace or return to historical average levels, that demand for any railcar types or railcar services will improve, or that our railcar backlog, orders or shipments will track industry-wide trends.\nOur Energy segment's nitrogen fertilizer business uses forward swap contracts primarily to reduce the exposure to changes in interest rates on its debt and to provide a cash flow hedge. These derivative instruments have been designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Accordingly, these instruments are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets at each reporting period end. The actual measurement of the cash flow hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings, if applicable. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the swaps is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in accordance with FASB ASC 815.\nOur Gaming segment has federal net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards pursuant to the purchase of Adamar of New Jersey, Inc. ( Adamar\u201d). Internal Revenue Code Section 382 ( Code 382\u201d) places certain limitations on the annual amount of NOL carryforwards that can be utilized when a change of ownership occurs. Our Gaming segment believes its purchase of Adamar was a change in ownership pursuant to Code 382. As a result of the annual limitation, the NOL carryforward amount available to be used in future periods was $161 million and will begin to expire in the year 2028 and forward. As of March 8, 2010, Tropicana had various net deferred tax assets made up primarily of the expected future tax benefit of net operating loss carryforwards and excess tax basis not yet deductible for tax purposes. A valuation allowance was provided in full against these net deferred tax assets upon emergence from bankruptcy. During the year ended December 31, 2014, our Gaming segment reversed the valuation allowance related to the net deferred tax assets by $196 million. The reduction in the valuation allowance was a result of our Gaming segment analyzing all positive and negative evidence and concluding that it was more likely than not to realize the benefit of this portion of its net deferred tax assets. The reduction in the valuation allowance was recorded as an income tax benefit during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nWith respect to the notional value of our short derivative swap positions (213% short exposure), our liquidity would decrease by the balance sheet unrealized loss if we were to close the positions at year end prices. This would be offset by a release of restricted cash balances collateralizing these positions as well as an increase in funds available to us pursuant to certain prime brokerage lines of credit. If we were to increase our short exposure by adding to these short positions, we would be required to provide cash collateral equal to a small percentage of the initial notional value at counterparties that require cash as collateral and then post additional collateral equal to 100% of the mark to market on adverse changes in fair value. For our counterparties who do not require cash collateral, funds available from lines of credit would decrease.\nOn February 28, 2016, Icahn Enterprises issued a proposal to the board of directors of Federal-Mogul to purchase the shares of Federal-Mogul common stock not owned by us in a merger transaction pursuant to which Federal-Mogul shareholders would receive $7.00 per share in cash for their Federal-Mogul shares.\nOn February 23, 2016, the board of directors of the general partner of Icahn Enterprises declared a quarterly distribution in the amount of $1.50 per depositary unit, which will be paid on or about April 12, 2016 to depositary unitholders of record at the close of business on March 7, 2016. Depositary unitholders will have until March, 31 2016 to make an election to receive either cash or additional depositary units; if a holder does not make an election, it will automatically be deemed to have elected to receive the dividend in cash. Depositary unitholders who elect to receive additional depositary units will receive units valued at the volume weighted average trading price of the units on NASDAQ during the 5 consecutive trading days ending April 7, 2016. No fractional depositary units will be issued pursuant to the distribution payment. Icahn Enterprises will make a cash payment in lieu of issuing fractional depositary units to any holders electing to receive depositary units. Any holders that would only be eligible to receive a fraction of a depositary unit based on the above calculation will receive a cash payment.\non factors beyond its control, including the supply of and demand for crude oil, as well as gasoline and other refined products which, in turn, depend on, among other factors, changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and foreign political affairs, production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels and the extent of government regulation. Because the petroleum business applies first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") accounting to value its inventory, crude oil price movements may impact net income in the short term because of changes in the value of its unhedged on-hand inventory. The effect of changes in crude oil prices on our results of operations is influenced by the rate at which the prices of refined products adjust to reflect these changes.\nOur share of the Investment Funds' net (losses) profits through our interests in the Investment Funds was $(760) million, $(305) million, and $812 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nSee Note 10, Debt,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report for additional information concerning terms, restrictions and covenants of our debt. As of December 31, 2015, we are in compliance with all debt covenants.\nPerformance Attribution\nOur Railcar segment's current capital expenditure plans for 2016 include projects that our Railcar segment expects will expand capabilities, maintain equipment, improve efficiencies and reduce costs. Our Railcar segment also plans to increase its railcar lease fleet in 2016 to meet customer demand for leased railcars that have been ordered. Capital expenditures for 2016 are currently projected to be approximately $117 million, which includes expected additions to our Railcar segment's lease fleet of approximately $80 million.\nFor 2015, Icahn Enterprises recorded an income tax expense of $68 million on pre-tax loss of $2.1 billion compared to an income tax benefit of $103 million on pre-tax loss of $632 million for 2014. Icahn Enterprises' effective income tax rate was (3.3)% and 16.3% for 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nFederal-Mogul's subsidiaries in Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States are party to accounts receivable factoring and securitization facilities. Gross accounts receivable transferred under these facilities were $408 million and $306 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of those gross amounts, $401 million and $293 million, respectively, qualify as sales as defined in FASB ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing. The remaining transferred receivables were pledged as collateral and accounted for as secured borrowings and recorded in the consolidated balance sheets within accounts receivable, net and debt. Proceeds from the transfers of accounts receivable qualifying as sales were $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nAdditionally, during 2015 we acquired certain businesses within our Automotive segment as well as acquired Ferrous Resources, which constitutes our Mining segment. Also, during 2015 our Holding Company purchased certain investments, including a non-controlling interest in Pep Boys, as discussed earlier, and which we subsequently acquired the entire company in February 2016. See Note 3, \"Operating Units - Automotive,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding thesse acquisition.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nCertain of the facilities contain terms that require Federal-Mogul to share in the credit risk of the sold receivables. The maximum exposures to Federal-Mogul associated with certain of these facilities' terms were $11 million and $17 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOur Interests in the Investment Funds\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nOther Segments\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nExcluding the unfavorable currency impact of $235 million, Motorparts' external sales increased by $291 million (net of intercompany eliminations). This increase was primarily due to additional sales related to the Honeywell braking and Affinia chassis component acquisitions. Including the impact of sales from acquisitions, the Motorparts business' sales in North America, EMEA and ROW grew by 1.4%, 4.8% and 1.6%, respectively.\nOther Income, Net\nReal Estate\nMany of the sites that are likely to be the costliest to remediate are often current or former commercial waste disposal facilities to which numerous companies sent wastes. Despite the potential joint and several liability which might be imposed on Federal-Mogul under CERCLA and some of the other laws pertaining to these sites, its share of the total waste sent to these sites has generally been small. Federal-Mogul believes its exposure for liability at these sites is limited.\nGlobal vehicle sales increased by 1.8% in 2015. European vehicle sales rose 3.5% from 2014 levels. North American vehicles sales increased 6.3%, with positive growth in Canada, Mexico and the United States. Vehicle sales in the Asia-Pacific\nGaming\nWe have off-balance sheet risk related to investment activities associated with certain financial instruments, including futures, options, credit default swaps and securities sold, not yet purchased.

Refining margin and refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact are non-GAAP measures that we believe are important to investors in evaluating our Energy segment refineries' performance as a general indication of the amount above our Energy segment's cost of goods sold (taking into account the impact of utilization of FIFO) they are able to sell refined products. We believe that refining margin and refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel are important to enable investors to better understand and evaluate our Energy segment's ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in the review of our overall financial, operational and economic performance. In addition, we believe that presenting refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel adjusted for FIFO impact is useful to investors because this measure more accurately reflects the current operating environment.\nAutomotive\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSince inception in November 2004, the Investment Funds' gross return is 171.1%, representing an annualized rate of return of 9.3% through December 31, 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nThe following table sets forth the performance attribution for the Investment Funds for the comparative periods presented.\nInvestment\nCVR Dividends and CVR Refining Distributions\nNet gain from investment activities was $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to a loss of $137 million for the corresponding prior year period. The net gain from investment activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was attributable to certain securities held by the Holding Company. The net loss from investment activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes realized and unrealized losses from certain derivative swaps that were assigned to the Holding Company from the Investment segment during August 2013. These derivative swaps were closed out during the third quarter of 2014. See Note 7, \"Financial Instruments - Investment Segment and Holding Company,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nMeasurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets that we expect to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\nOur Investment segment is comprised of various private investment funds, including Icahn Partners L.P. (\"Icahn Partners\"), Icahn Partners Master Fund LP, Icahn Partners Master Fund II LP and Icahn Partners Master Fund III LP (collectively, the \"Master Funds\", and together with Icahn Partners, the \"Investment Funds\"), through which we invest our proprietary capital. Effective January 1, 2014, Icahn Partners Master Fund II LP and Icahn Partners Master Fund III LP were merged with and into Icahn Partners. We and certain of Mr. Icahn's wholly owned affiliates are the sole investors in the Investment Funds. Icahn Onshore LP and Icahn Offshore LP (together, the \"General Partners\") act as the general partner of Icahn Partners and the Master Funds, respectively. The General Partners provide investment advisory and certain administrative and back office services to the Investment Funds but do not provide such services to any other entities, individuals or accounts. Interests in the Investment Funds are not offered to outside investors.\nOn February 3, 2016, pursuant to a tender offer, Icahn Enterprises acquired a majority of the outstanding shares of Pep Boys - Manny, Moe & Jack (\"Pep Boys\"), a leading aftermarket provider of automotive service, tires, parts and accessories across the United States and Puerto Rico. On February 4, 2016, Icahn Enterprises completed the acquisition of the remaining outstanding shares of Pep Boys and our wholly owned subsidiary, IEP Parts Acquisition LLC, merged with and into Pep Boys, with Pep Boys surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Icahn Enterprises Holdings. The total value for the acquisition of Pep Boys was approximately $1.2 billion, including the fair value of our equity interest in Pep-Boys just prior to our acquisition of a controlling interest. Pep Boys' operations will comprise a portion of our Automotive segment and will be operated independently of Federal-Mogul and IEH Auto.\nMetals\nDue to the structure of our business, the consolidated results of operations for Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings are substantially the same. Differences primarily relate to non-cash portions of interest expense, and are only reflected in the results of operations for our Holding Company. The following table summarizes total revenues, net (loss) income and net (loss) income attributable to Icahn Enterprises Holdings for our Holding Company and the consolidated totals with respect to Icahn Enterprises Holdings for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nOur Energy segment's petroleum business uses futures contracts, options, and forward contracts primarily to reduce exposure to changes in crude oil prices and finished goods product prices to provide economic hedges of inventory positions. Although management considers these derivatives economic hedges, these derivative instruments do not qualify as hedges for hedge accounting purposes under FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (\"FASB ASC 815\"), and accordingly are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded in earnings as a component of other income, net in the period of change. The estimated fair values of forward and swap contracts are based on quoted market prices and assumptions for the estimated forward yield curves of related commodities in periods when quoted market prices are unavailable.\nIcahn Enterprises owns a 99% limited partner interest in Icahn Enterprises Holdings. Icahn Enterprises G.P. Inc. ( Icahn Enterprises GP\u201d), which is owned and controlled by Mr. Carl C. Icahn, owns a 1% general partner interest in each of Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings. Icahn Enterprises Holdings and its subsidiaries own substantially all of our assets and liabilities and conduct substantially all of our operations. Therefore, the financial results of Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings are substantially the same, with differences relating primarily to debt, as discussed further in Note 10, \"Debt,\" to the consolidated financial statements, and to the allocation of the general partner interest, which is reflected as an aggregate 1.99% general partner interest in the financial statements of Icahn Enterprises. In addition to the above, Mr. Icahn and his affiliates owned 117,033,818, or approximately 89.0%, of Icahn Enterprises' outstanding depositary units as of December 31, 2015.\nLong-lived assets held and used by our various operating segments and long-lived assets to be disposed of are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as vacancies and rejected leases and reduced production capacity, indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In performing the review for recoverability, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest charges, is less than the carrying amount of the asset an impairment loss is recognized.\nNet sales and cost of goods sold for the period June 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015 were $30 million and $38 million, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nOf our long exposure of 199%, the fair value of our long positions (with certain adjustments) represented 193% of our long exposure. The notional value of our long derivative positions, which primarily included single name equity swaps and single name OTC equity forward contracts, represented 6% of our long exposure.\nPart of Tropicana's overall strategy includes consideration of expansion opportunities in new gaming jurisdictions, underserved markets and acquisition and other strategic opportunities that may arise periodically. Tropicana may require additional funds in order to execute on such strategic growth, and may incur additional debt or issue additional equity to finance any such transactions. We cannot assure you that Tropicana will be able to incur such debt or issue any such additional equity on acceptable terms or at all.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCommitments and Contingencies - Litigation\nDefinite-lived assets held by our various segments are periodically reviewed for impairment indicators. If impairment indicators exist, we perform the required analysis and record an impairment charge as required by applicable U.S. GAAP.\nThe Investment Funds historically have had access to significant amounts of cash available from prime brokerage lines of credit, subject to customary terms and market conditions.\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased by $220 million (23%) compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower shipment volumes and lower material and processing costs. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was a loss of 2% for each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, as margins continued to be negatively impacted by ongoing competitive pressure for shredder feedstock.\nOur Railcar segment continues to invest capital and evaluate opportunities to further expand its manufacturing flexibility and repair capacity. During 2015 our Railcar segment completed three repair expansion projects and just recently in 2016 completed an expansion project at its tank railcar manufacturing facility, which enables it to perform retrofit and repair work in addition to the manufacturing work already performed there. Also during 2015, our Railcar segment began production of its newly designed tank railcars that satisfy the May 2015 regulations. Our Railcar segment's continuous commitment to quality and its efforts to increase flexibility at its tank railcar manufacturing facility allows it to build these designs efficiently and cost\n \u2022 Long-term rate of return on plan assets: The required use of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year. While the development of the long-term rate of return on assets gives appropriate consideration to recent fund performance and historical returns, the assumption is designed to approximate a long-term prospective rate. The expected long-term rate of return used to calculate net periodic pension cost is 6.55% for U.S. plans and a weighted average of 3.52% for non-U.S. plans. \nRefining margin per barrel of crude oil throughput decreased to $11.38 for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $16.90 for the corresponding prior year period. Refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact was $13.62 per crude oil throughput barrel for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $16.59 per crude oil throughput barrel for the corresponding prior year period. Gross margin per barrel decreased to $3.42 for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to gross margin per barrel of $9.48 in the corresponding prior year period. The decrease in refining margin and gross margin per barrel was primarily due to a decrease in sales price for gasoline and distillate. The average sales price for both gasoline and distillates declined approximately 7% for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year period.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the borrowing availability under the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolving Facility was $170 million and $516 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, the outstanding balance on the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolving Facility was $340 million. As of December 31, 2014, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolving Facility. Federal-Mogul had $40 million and $34 million of letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, under Federal-Mogul's term loan credit facility. To the extent letters of credit are issued under the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolving Facility there will be a corresponding decrease in borrowings available under this facility.\nOn an ongoing basis, we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us. While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions, we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, we make estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries, if any. We accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made.\nIEH Auto\nOur consolidated other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $75 million and $182 million, respectively. Equity earnings from non-consolidated affiliates, primarily from our Automotive segment, were $62 million and $50 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, our Energy segment recorded (loss) gains on certain derivative contracts of $(29) million and $186 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Included in our consolidated other income, net was a loss on extinguishment of debt of $162 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. See Note 7, \"Financial Instruments,\" and Note 16, \"Other Income, Net,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nOn January 30, 2014, Viskase entered into a credit agreement that provided for a $275 million senior secured covenant light term loan facility ( Viskase Term Loan\u201d). The Viskase Term Loan bears interest at a LIBOR Rate plus 3.25% (with the LIBOR Rate carrying a 1.00% floor), or at a Base Rate equal to the sum of (1) the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate, (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%, (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1.0%, or (d) 2.0%, plus (2) 2.25%. The Viskase Term Loan has a 1% per annum amortization with a maturity date of January 30, 2021. See Note 10, \"Debt - Food Packaging,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding this credit facility.\nConsolidated interest expense for Icahn Enterprises increased by $287 million (51%) as compared to the corresponding prior year period. The increase for Icahn Enterprises Holdings was $286 million (51%). The increases were primarily due to higher interest expense from our Investment segment attributable to due to broker balances, higher interest expense from our Automotive segment due to refinancing of its term loans in April 2014, higher interest expense from our Railcar segment due to higher debt balances, offset in part by lower interest expense from our Energy segment due to overall lower interest rate on outstanding debt balances and higher capitalized interest, lower interest expense from our Food Packaging segment due to lower interest rates on outstanding debt balances and lower interest on debt refinancing from the Holding Company during the first quarter of 2014.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.\nNet revenues from Tropicana AC comprise approximately 40% and 43% of our Gaming segment's net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Tropicana AC casino revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year period as a result of increased customer volumes due, in part, to the closure of one of Tropicana AC's competitors in Atlantic City in January 2014. In addition, during the third quarter of 2014, three additional competitors ceased operations in Atlantic City. Based on market data, the Atlantic City market experienced year-over-year decline in casino win of 8.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, Tropicana AC casino revenues increased primarily due to 17.9% higher slot volumes and 4.3 percentage point increase in the table game hold percentage, partially offset by 16.0% lower table game volumes, including lower volumes of high-end play for the year ended December 31, 2014. Internet gaming, which commenced in November 2013, also contributed to the increase in casino revenues.\nAs discussed in Note 3, \"Operating Units - Mining,\" to the consolidated financial statements, we obtained control, and consolidated, the results of Ferrous Resources Limited (\"Ferrous Resources\") during the second quarter of 2015. Ferrous Resources represents our Mining segment.\nOur Food Packaging segment is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates. In addition to those markets in which Viskase prices its products in U.S. dollars, it prices its products in certain of its foreign operations in euros and Brazilian reals. As a result, a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies of profitable foreign subsidiaries can have a favorable effect on Viskase's profitability. Conversely, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currencies of profitable foreign subsidiaries can have a negative effect on the profitability of our Food Packaging segment.\nGross margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $37 million (4%) as compared to the corresponding prior year period. Gross margin was 14% and 15% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in the gross margin percentage over the respective periods was primarily due to costs incurred related to Motorparts business strategic initiatives as well as unfavorable foreign currency impact.\nWe finalized the annual goodwill impairment test for our Energy segment during the third quarter of 2015. Based on the results of our annual goodwill impairment test for our Energy segment, while the fair market value of our Energy segment's Petroleum reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value, the fair market value of our Energy segment's Fertilizer reporting unit was approximately 1% in excess of its carrying value and was therefore considered at risk for failing \"Step 1\" of the goodwill impairment analysis. Based on worsening sales trends for our Energy segment's Fertilizer reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2015, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test for our Energy segment's Fertilizer reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2015. Based on this analysis, our Energy segment recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $253 million, which represented the full amount of the remaining goodwill allocated to this reporting unit. Due to the complexity in \"Step 2\" goodwill impairment test, we expect to finalize the assessment of our Energy segment's goodwill\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, creating a new topic, FASB ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, superseding revenue recognition requirements in FASB ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. This ASU requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, an entity is required to disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. This ASU was amended by ASU No. 2015-14, issued in August 2015, which deferred the original effective date by one year; the effective date of this ASU is for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, using one of two retrospective application methods. Early adoption is permitted only as of the annual reporting periods beginning after\nTropicana estimates that its aggregate capital expenditures for 2016 will be $81 million. In addition, Tropicana estimates that it will spend approximately $25 million in 2016 related to its $50 million commitment to develop a landside gaming facility at one of its properties.\nForeign currencies\nSee Note 10, \"Debt - Railcar,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding these refinancings.\nFederal-Mogul sponsors defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans for certain employees and retirees around the world. Federal-Mogul's defined benefit plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return, discount rate, and mortality and mortality improvement rates of plan participants.\nThe scrap metals business is highly cyclical and is substantially dependent upon the overall economic conditions in the U.S. and other global markets. Ferrous and non-ferrous scrap has been historically vulnerable to significant declines in consumption and product pricing during prolonged periods of economic downturn or stagnation.\nand sold in connection with its restructuring activities and has accrued $16 million as of December 31, 2015, primarily related to removing hazardous materials in buildings. For further discussion regarding these commitments, among others, see Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\nOur Automotive segment is affected by the following trends and market conditions:\nStatements included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d which are not historical in nature are intended to be, and are hereby identified as, forward-looking statements\u201d for purposes of the safe harbor provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or by Public Law 104-67.\nGaming\nRailcar services revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period primarily due to an increase in demand, a favorable change in mix of work at our Railcar segment's repair facilities and the additional capacity resulting from expansion projects during 2015.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which amends FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Current GAAP requires an entity to separate income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. This ASU requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We have elected to early adopt this ASU for the year ended December 31, 2015 on a prospective basis. As we do not present a classified statement of position, this ASU will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and disclosures.\nFederal-Mogul's net sales were negatively impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against several global currencies which resulted in an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $642 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Federal-Mogul's sales volumes increased by $718 million. This sales growth is comprised of an increase in the Powertrain business' external sales of $427 million, reflecting the inclusion of the acquisition of certain engine components business of TRW Automotive Holdings Corp.'s (\"TRW\") as well as an increase in volume for the quarter. External sales in the Motorparts business increased by $291 million (net of intercompany eliminations), driven primarily by the acquisitions of Affinia Group Inc. (\"Affinia\") and Honeywell International Inc.'s (\"Honeywell\") brake component business.\nOn April 15, 2014, Federal-Mogul entered into a tranche B term loan facility (the Tranche B Facility\u201d) and a tranche C term loan facility (the Tranche C Facility,\u201d and together with the Tranche B Facility, the Federal-Mogul Term Facilities\u201d), and assumed all of the obligations of Federal-Mogul Corporation with respect to the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolving Facility.\nRailcar leasing revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period due to an increase in number of railcars leased to customers as lease rates were relatively flat compared to 2014. Total railcars on lease at the end of 2015 were approximately 45,050 as compared to approximately 39,700 at the end of 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSummarized ferrous tons and non-ferrous pounds sold for 2015, 2014 and 2013 are as follows:\nThe recent decline in oil prices results in lower fuel prices for consumers. Lower fuel prices provide consumers with more discretionary income for vehicle repairs and tends to encourage more driving miles, which in turn accelerates wear on vehicle components, accelerating the need for replacements. Low fuel prices also encourage more vehicle sales, which increases demand for parts from OEMs.\nThe Federal-Mogul Term Facilities, among other things, (i) provide for aggregate commitments under the Tranche B Facility of $700 million with a maturity date of April 15, 2018, (ii) provide for aggregate commitments under the Tranche C Facility of approximately $1.9 billion with a maturity date of April 15, 2021, (iii) increase the interest rates applicable to the Federal-Mogul Term Facilities, (iv) provide that for all outstanding letters of credit there is a corresponding decrease in borrowings available under the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolving Facility, (v) provide that in the event that as of a particular determination date more than $700 million aggregate principal amount of existing term loans and certain related refinancing indebtedness will become due within 91 days of such determination date, the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolving Facility will mature on such determination date, (vi) provide for additional incremental indebtedness, secured on a pari passu basis, of an unlimited amount of additional indebtedness if Federal-Mogul meets a financial covenant incurrence test, and (vii) amend certain other restrictive covenants. Pursuant to the Federal-Mogul Term Facilities, Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation assumed all of the obligations of Federal-Mogul Corporation with respect to the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolving Facility.\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $317 million (5%) as compared to the prior year (net of certain intercompany activity). The increase attributable to Federal-Mogul was primarily due to an increase in sales volumes in both the Powertrain and Motorparts businesses, reflecting an inclusion of the acquisitions of the TRW engine component business, the Affinia chasis business as well as the Honeywell brake component business. In addition, cost of goods sold increased due to the IEH Auto acquisition.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nFerrous Resources' performance driver has historically been demand for raw materials from Chinese steelmakers. However, for the period June 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, our Mining segment has been concentrating on sales in its domestic market, Brazil, where the best margins are being captured. During the fourth quarter of 2015, both domestic and global steel industries continued to show weakness as steel mills' utilization rates failed to recover and iron ore prices remained weak.\nForward-Looking Statements\nFor 2014, Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings recognized a deferred tax benefit on its pre-tax loss primarily due to income tax benefits recorded on a release of valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets in our Gaming segment of $196 million.\nHome Fashion\nOn October 23, 2012, CVR Refining LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Coffeyville Finance Inc., completed a private offering of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (the \"2022 Notes\"). The net proceeds from the offering of the 2022 Notes were used to purchase certain first lien secured notes due 2015 through a tender offer and settled redemption in the fourth quarter of 2012.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nThe following table reflects, at December 31, 2015, our contractual cash obligations, subject to certain conditions, due over the indicated periods:\nCost of goods sold for the petroleum business, before eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period decreased by $3.8 billion (45%), primarily due to a decrease in cost of consumed crude oil and purchased products for resale. The decrease in consumed crude oil cost was due to a decrease in crude oil throughput volume and crude oil prices. The average cost per barrel of crude oil consumed for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $47.86 as compared to $92.57 for the comparable prior period, a decrease of approximately 48%. The impact of FIFO accounting also impacted cost of goods sold during the comparable periods. Under the FIFO accounting method, changes in crude oil prices can cause fluctuations in the inventory valuation of crude oil, work in process and finished goods, thereby resulting in a favorable FIFO inventory impact when crude oil prices increase and an unfavorable FIFO inventory impact when crude oil prices decrease. For the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the petroleum business had unfavorable FIFO inventory impacts of $60 million and $161 million, respectively. The major factor contributing to the unfavorable FIFO impact for the year ended December 31, 2014 was the decline in the market price of West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\"), a grade of crude oil used as a benchmark in oil pricing, from $95.44 at the beginning of 2014 to $53.27 on December 31, 2014. The FIFO inventory impact for 2014 included a lower of cost or market write-down of $37 million, which was recorded in the fourth quarter as a result of the significant decline in the market price of crude oil.\nregion increased 1.5% in 2015, reaching another record high. Among the major regions, only South America posted a decline in 2015 which was down 21.1%.\nTropicana's cash flows are and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, many of which are outside of its control, including regulatory restrictions, competition and other general business conditions. Tropicana believes that it will have sufficient liquidity through a combination of available cash, credit facilities and cash flow from its properties to fund its cash requirements and capital expenditures for its normal operating activities.\nFederal-Mogul is a leading global supplier of a broad range of components, accessories and systems to the automotive, small engine, heavy-duty, marine, railroad, agricultural, off-road, aerospace and energy, industrial and transport markets, including customers in both the original equipment manufacturers and servicers ( OE\u201d) market and the replacement market ( aftermarket\u201d). Federal-Mogul's customers include the world's largest automotive OEs and major distributors and retailers in the independent aftermarket.\nPart Replacement Trends\nDuring 2015, we declared four quarterly distributions aggregating $6.00 per depositary unit. Depositary unitholders were given the option to make an election to receive the distributions in either cash or additional depositary units; if a holder did not make an election, it was automatically deemed to have elected to receive the distributions in cash. All four distributions declared in 2015 were paid in 2015. As a result of the above declared distributions, during 2015 we distributed an aggregate 8,337,645 of Icahn Enterprises' depositary units to those Depositary unitholders who elected to receive such distributions in additional depositary units. Additionally, during 2015 we paid $114 million to those Depositary unitholders who had elected to receive such distributions in cash.\nIn order to derive the refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel, our Energy segment utilizes the total dollar figures for refining margin, as derived above, and divides that by the applicable number of crude oil throughput barrels for the period. Our Energy segment's calculation of refining margin and refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact may differ from calculations of other companies in the industry, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Under our Energy segment's FIFO accounting method, changes in crude oil prices can cause fluctuations in the inventory valuation of our Energy segment's crude oil, work in process and finished goods, thereby resulting in favorable FIFO impacts when crude oil prices increase and unfavorable FIFO impacts when crude oil prices decrease.\nAdditionally, our Railcar segment expects its future cash flows from operations could be impacted by the state of the credit markets and the overall economy, the number of our Railcar segment's railcar orders and shipments and its production rates. Our Railcar segment's future liquidity may also be impacted by the number of new railcar orders leased versus sold.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nNet sales for the fertilizer business, before eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year period decreased by $25 million (8%), primarily due to lower UAN sales prices and ammonia sales volumes, partially offset by higher UAN sales volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2014, CVR sold 951,043 and 24,378 tons of UAN and ammonia, respectively, with a sales price of $288 and $536 per ton, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2013, CVR sold 904,596 and 40,535 tons of UAN and ammonia, respectively, with sales price of $315 and $660 per ton, respectively. On-stream factors (total number of hours operated divided by total hours in the reporting period) for the gasification, ammonia and UAN units were 96.8%, 92.6% and 92.0%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 95.6%, 94.4% and 91.9%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nFederal-Mogul has conditional asset retirement obligations (\"CARO\"), primarily related to removal costs of hazardous materials in buildings, for which it believes reasonable cost estimates cannot be made at this time because it does not believe it has a reasonable basis to assign probabilities to a range of potential settlement dates for these retirement obligations. Accordingly, Federal-Mogul is currently unable to determine amounts to accrue for CARO at such sites.\neffectively. Our Railcar segment cannot assure you any increased repair capacity or manufacturing flexibility will be sufficient or necessary to meet the demands of the industry.\nCost of goods sold for the petroleum business, before eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year period increased by $550 million (7%), primarily due to an increase in cost of consumed oil and refined fuels purchased for resale. The average cost per barrel of crude oil consumed for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $92.57 compared to $95.05 for the comparable period of 2013, a decrease of approximately 3%. Sales volume of refined fuels increased by approximately 8%. The impact of FIFO accounting also impacted cost of goods sold during the comparable periods. Under the FIFO accounting method, changes in crude oil prices can cause fluctuations in the inventory valuation of crude oil, work in process and finished goods, thereby resulting in a favorable FIFO inventory impact when crude oil prices increase and an unfavorable FIFO inventory impact when crude oil prices decrease. For the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the petroleum business had an unfavorable FIFO inventory impact of $161 million and a favorable FIFO inventory impact of $21 million, respectively. The major factor contributing to the unfavorable FIFO impact for the year ended December 31, 2014 was the decline in the market price of WTI from $95.44 at the beginning of 2014 to $53.27 on December 31, 2014. The FIFO inventory impact for 2014 includes a lower of cost or market write-down of $37 million, which was recorded in the fourth quarter as a result of the significant decline in the market price of crude oil.\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of April 30 of each year for our Energy segment, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. The first step of the impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of our Energy segment's assets to their respective carrying values to determine the potential for goodwill impairment. The second step of the impairment test, if necessary, involves quantifying the level of goodwill impairment.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our Holding Company had investments in the Investment Funds with a total fair market value of approximately $3.4 billion. As of December 31, 2015, our Holding Company had cash and cash equivalents of $166 million and total debt of approximately $5.5 billion.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nprimarily driven by lower shipments of aluminum products due to the exit from aluminum tolling activities at the end of the first quarter of 2014 and to a refocus of aluminum shredding capacity in 2014. Average selling prices for non-ferrous decreased $0.03 per pound (3%) due to lower market pricing.\nNet sales for the petroleum business, before eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year period increased by $146 million (2%), primarily due to higher overall sales volume largely offset by lower sales prices for gasoline and distillates. Sales volume increased by approximately 8% for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year period. Sales volumes for 2014 were impacted by reduced crude oil throughput and production as a result of the Coffeyville refinery shutdown following the isomerization unit fire during the third quarter of 2014 and FCCU outage at the Wynnewood refinery during the fourth quarter of 2014. Sales volumes for 2013 were impacted by downtime associated with the FCCU outage at the Coffeyville refinery during the third quarter of 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, CVR's petroleum business sold approximately 40.3 million and 34.9 million barrels of gasoline and distillate, respectively, with an average sales price per gallon for gasoline and distillate of $2.53 and $2.81, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2013, CVR's petroleum business sold approximately 37.8 million and 30.6 million barrels of gasoline and distillate, respectively, with an average sales price per gallon for gasoline and distillate of $2.72 and $3.02, respectively.\nThe Investment Funds' aggregate return was -18.0% for 2015, due to losses in their long equity exposure, primarily in a few of their largest core holdings including energy. These losses were partially offset by gains in long equity positions in a few of their largest core holdings as well as gains in their short positions, including broad market hedges.\nDistributions on Depositary Units\n\nWith respect to both our long positions that are not notionalized (193% long) and our short positions that are not notionalized (11% short), each 1% change in exposure as a result of purchases or sales (assuming no change in value) would have a 1% impact on our cash and cash equivalents. Changes in exposure as a result of purchases and sales as well as adverse changes in market value would also have an effect on funds available to us pursuant to prime brokerage lines of credit.\nEnvironmental Matters\nFederal-Mogul\nFederal-Mogul believes that recorded environmental liabilities will be adequate to cover its estimated liability for its exposure in respect of such matters. In the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded by Federal-Mogul, our Automotive segment's results of operations could be materially affected. At December 31, 2015, Federal-Mogul estimates reasonably possible material additional losses, above and beyond its best estimate of required remediation costs as recorded, to approximate $44 million.\nOur consolidated impairment for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $653 million (484%) as compared to the corresponding prior year period. The increase was primarily due to impairment of goodwill by our Automotive and Energy segments of $312 million and $253 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2015. See Note 6, \"Fair Value Measurements,\" and Note 8, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net - Energy,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nvalue, Step 2 must be completed to quantify the amount of impairment. Step 2 calculates the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, of the reporting unit, from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in Step 1. The implied fair value of goodwill determined in this step is compared to the carrying value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss, equal to the difference, is recognized.\nOur consolidated restructuring costs were $84 million and $50 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which were primarily attributable to our Automotive segment in each of the respective periods as discussed below.\nThe prices of crude oil and other feedstocks and refined product prices are also affected by other factors, such as product pipeline capacity, local market conditions and the operating levels of competing refineries. Crude oil costs and the prices of refined products have historically been subject to wide fluctuations. Widespread expansion or upgrades of competitors' facilities, price volatility, international political and economic developments and other factors are likely to continue to play an important role in refining industry economics. These factors can impact, among other things, the level of inventories in the market, resulting in price volatility and a reduction in product margins. Moreover, the refining industry typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in demand for refined products, such as increases in the demand for gasoline during the summer driving season and for home heating oil during the winter, primarily in the Northeast. In addition to current market conditions, there are long-term factors that may impact the demand for refined products. These factors include mandated renewable fuels standards, proposed climate change laws and regulations, and increased mileage standards for vehicles. The petroleum business is also subject to the Renewable Fuel Standard (\"RFS\") of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"), which requires it to either blend \"renewable fuels\" with its transportation fuels or purchase renewable fuel credits, known as renewable identification numbers (\"RINs\"), in lieu of blending.\nAs further discussed below, in February 2016, ARI repaid amounts outstanding under the ARI Revolving Loans (as defined below) in full or $100 million. The contractual commitment table above excludes this transaction.\nReal Estate revenues and expenses include results from club operations, sales of residential units, and rental income and expenses, including income from financing leases. Sales of residential units are included in net sales in our consolidated financial statements. Results from club and rental operations, including financing lease income, are included in other revenues from operations in our consolidated financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold 14 commercial rental properties and Oak Harbor development and operations (which historically was operated as part of Grand Harbor), recognizing an aggregate gain of $40 million which is included in other income, net in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nExcept as described below, no provision has been made for federal, state, local or foreign income taxes on the results of operations generated by partnership activities as such taxes are the responsibility of the partners. Our corporate subsidiaries account for their income taxes under the asset and liability method.\n\nIcahn Enterprises Holdings\nWe conduct our Railcar segment through our majority ownership interests in American Railcar Industries, Inc. (\"ARI\") and American Railcar Leasing, LLC (\"ARL\").\n\nThe fertilizer business' cost of goods sold, before eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year period increased by $18 million (9%), primarily due to increased distribution costs mostly due to the increase in railcar regulatory inspections and repairs as well as increased ammonia purchases, partially offset by lower freight and pet coke expenses. The increase in railcar regulatory inspections and repairs is related to a larger portion of the fertilizer business' fleet due for regulatory inspections and related repairs during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year period.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased by $6 million (2%) compared to the prior year. The decrease in net sales was due to $4 million attributable to sales volume and $2 million attributable to foreign currency translation.\nWe conduct our Automotive segment through our majority ownership in Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation (\"Federal-Mogul\") and through our wholly owned subsidiary, IEH Auto Parts Holding LLC (\"IEH Auto\"), which acquired substantially all of the auto parts assets in the United States of Uni-Select, Inc. through an acquisition that was consummated during the second quarter of 2015. See Note 3, \"Operating Units - Automotive,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this acquisition. Intercompany transactions between Federal-Mogul and IEH Auto have been eliminated in consolidation and the discussion below is net of eliminations.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had investments with a fair market value of approximately $3.4 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, in the Investment Funds.\n (1) We consolidated Ferrous Resources effective June 1, 2015. \nAutomotive\nFor 2014, Icahn Enterprises Holdings recorded an income tax benefit of $103 million on pre-tax loss of $631 million compared to an income tax benefit of $118 million on pre-tax income of approximately $2.3 billion for 2013. Icahn Enterprises Holdings' effective income tax rate was 16.3% and (5.1)% for 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nWe are a diversified holding company owning subsidiaries currently engaged in the following continuing operating businesses: Investment, Automotive, Energy, Metals, Railcar, Gaming, Mining, Food Packaging, Real Estate and Home Fashion. We also report the results of our Holding Company, which includes the results of certain subsidiaries of Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings (unless otherwise noted), and investment activity and expenses associated with the Holding Company.\nOn July 28, 2015, ARI's board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of its outstanding common stock (\"ARI Stock Repurchase Program\"). The ARI Stock Repurchase Program will end upon the earlier of the date on which it is terminated by ARI's board of directors or when all authorized repurchases are completed. The timing and amount of stock repurchases, if any, will be determined based upon ARI's evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The ARI Stock Repurchase Program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time and ARI has no obligation to repurchase any amount of its common stock under the ARI Stock Repurchase Program. Under the ARI Stock Repurchase Program, ARI repurchased shares of its common stock during the year ended December 31, 2015 at a cost of approximately $57 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, ARI repurchased additional shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $5 million.\nInvesting Activities\nAutomotive\nNet sales in the Motorparts business increased by $281 million primarily due to the Affinia chassis and the Honeywell brake component acquisitions. Including the impact of sales from acquisitions, the Motorparts business' sales in North America, EMEA and ROW grew by 3.0%, 5.0% and 1.1%, respectively.\nCVR divides the petroleum business and the nitrogen fertilizer business' capital spending needs into two categories: maintenance and growth. Maintenance capital spending includes only non-discretionary maintenance projects and projects required to comply with environmental, health and safety regulations. CVR undertakes discretionary capital spending based on the expected return on incremental capital employed. Discretionary capital projects generally involve an expansion of existing capacity, improvement in product yields, and/or a reduction in direct operating expenses. Major scheduled turnaround expenses are expensed when incurred.\nMr. Icahn, along with his affiliates (excluding Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings), makes investments in the Investment Funds. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the total fair market value of investments in the Investment Funds made by Mr. Icahn and his affiliates was approximately $4.1 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively.\nForward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from trends, plans, or expectations set forth in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties may include the risks and uncertainties described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nRestructuring\nNet sales for the fertilizer business, before eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period decreased by $10 million (3%), primarily due to lower UAN sales prices and UAN sales volumes, partially offset by higher ammonia sales volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2015, CVR sold 939,547 and 32,326 tons of UAN and ammonia, respectively, with a sales price of $275 and $533 per ton, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2014, CVR sold 951,043 and 24,378 tons of UAN and ammonia, respectively, with a sales price of $288 and $536 per ton, respectively. On-stream factors (total number of hours operated divided by total hours in the reporting period) for the gasification, ammonia and UAN units were 90.2%, 87.5% and 87.3%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 96.8%, 92.6% and 92.0%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAs of December 31, 2015, CVR Refining and its subsidiaries had availability under the Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility of $290 million and had letters of credit outstanding of $28 million. Availability under the Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility was limited by borrowing base conditions as of December 31, 2015. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, CVR Partners had $25 million availability under its revolving credit facility, with an uncommitted incremental facility of up to $50 million.\nGlobal Vehicle Production Levels\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nOn July 31, 2015 Tropicana's board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $50 million of its outstanding common stock with no set expiration date (\"Tropicana Stock Repurchase Program\"). The Tropicana Stock Repurchase Program will end upon the earlier of the date on which the plan is terminated by Tropicana's board of directors or when all authorized repurchases are completed. The timing and amount of stock repurchases, if any, will be determined based upon Tropicana's evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The Tropicana Stock Repurchase Program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time and Tropicana has no obligation to repurchase any amount of its common stock under the Tropicana Stock Repurchase Program. As of the date of this Report, Tropicana has not yet repurchased any shares of its common stock under the Tropicana Stock Repurchase Program.\nCVR's Annual Report on Form 10-K contains a detailed description of its business, products, industry, operating strategy and associated risks. CVR's filings with the SEC are available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we received an aggregate of $161 million and $374 million, respectively, in dividends from CVR and distributions from CVR Refining, including one special dividend during 2014. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, CVR declared a quarterly dividend which will result in an additional $36 million in dividends and distributions paid to us in the first quarter of 2016.\nIn January, 2015, ARI refinanced its lease fleet financing facilities to, among other things, increase the aggregate borrowings thereunder. In connection with the refinancing, Longtrain Leasing III LLC (\"Longtrain Leasing III\") completed a private placement of $626 million in aggregate principal amount of notes consisting of $250 million in aggregate principal amount of its 2.98% fixed rate secured railcar equipment notes, Class A-1 (\"ARI Class A-1 Notes\") and $376 million in aggregate principal amount of its 4.06% fixed rate secured railcar equipment notes, Class A-2 (\"ARI Class A-2 Notes\", and collectively with the ARI Class A-1 Notes, the \"ARI 2015 Notes\"). Of the aggregate principal amount, $409 million was used to refinance ARI's lease fleet financing facilities, resulting in net proceeds of $212 million. The ARI 2015 Notes have a legal final maturity date of January 17, 2045 and an expected principal repayment date of January 15, 2025.\nAs we currently own approximately 82.0% of the common shares of CVR, the majority of CVR's dividend will directly upstream to us. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we received an aggregate of $161 million and $374 million, respectively, in dividends from CVR and distributions from CVR Refining. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, CVR declared a quarterly dividend which will result in an additional $36 million in dividends paid to us in the first quarter of 2016.\nGiven the global nature of our operations, we are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchanges rates. During 2015, foreign currency fluctuations had a considerable effect on our reported earnings in U.S. dollars compared to 2014.\nGross margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $155 million (15%) compared to the prior year (net of certain intercompany activity). Gross margin was 16% and 14% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The improvement in gross margin percentage over the respective periods was primarily attributable to the acquisition of IEH Auto during 2015 whose product sales margins are higher than those of Federal-Mogul's.\nThe Powertrain business' sales increase of $301 million is driven by an increase in sales volumes of $330 million, offset by customer price reductions of $29 million. This increase is attributable to higher sales volumes and market share gains across all regions of the world. Including the impact of sales from acquisitions, the Powertrain business' sales in North America, EMEA and ROW grew by 3.0%, 3.0% and 1.9%, respectively.\nNet sales for the petroleum business, before eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period decreased by $3.7 billion (42%), primarily due to significantly lower sales prices of transportation fuels and by-products. The average sales price per gallon for the year ended December 31, 2015 for gasoline and distillate decreased by approximately 36% and 42%, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year period. Overall sales volume decreased by approximately 3% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period. Sales volumes for 2015 were impacted by decreased production as a result of the major scheduled turnaround completed at the Coffeyville refinery in the fourth quarter of 2015 and lower purchased product volumes for resale. Sales volumes for 2014 were impacted by reduced crude oil throughput and production as a result of the Coffeyville refinery shutdown following the isomerization unit fire during the third quarter of 2014 and fluid catalytic cracking unit (\"FCCU\") outage at the Wynnewood refinery during the fourth quarter of 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, CVR's petroleum business sold approximately 40.1 million and 33.1 million barrels of gasoline and distillate, respectively, with an average sales price per gallon for gasoline and distillate of $1.61 and $1.62, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2014, CVR's petroleum business sold approximately 40.3 million and 34.9 million barrels of gasoline and distillate, respectively, with an average sales price per gallon for gasoline and distillate of $2.53 and $2.81, respectively.\nImpairment\nIncome Tax Expense\nFerrous shipments decreased by 235,000 gross tons (16%) while average pricing was $4 per gross ton (1%) higher during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the prior year period. The volume decrease was largely attributable to raw material shortages and transportation problems caused by severe weather conditions during the first quarter of 2014, to general material supply constraints, and to a poor export market that increased competition for limited domestic demand. The increase in average pricing for 2014 as compared to the prior year period was largely driven by higher market prices (4%) for ferrous scrap during the first nine months of 2014. A $50 per gross ton market price drop in the fourth quarter of 2014 reduced the full year-over-year price differential to 1% favorable. Non-ferrous shipment volumes decreased by 83,128,000 pounds (36%),\nThe following table sets forth performance information for the Investment Funds for the comparative periods presented. These returns represent a weighted-average composite of the average returns, net of expenses for the Investment Funds.\nFor 2014, Icahn Enterprises recorded an income tax benefit of $103 million on pre-tax loss of $632 million compared to an income tax benefit of $118 million on pre-tax income of approximately $2.3 billion for 2013. Icahn Enterprises' effective income tax rate was 16.3% and 5.1% for 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n\nCost of goods sold for the petroleum business includes cost of crude oil, other feedstocks and blendstocks, purchased products for resale, RINs, transportation distribution costs, costs associated with the operations of CVR's refineries (such costs are collectively referred to as \"direct operating expenses\") such as energy and utility costs, property taxes, catalyst and chemical costs, repairs and maintenance and labor and environmental compliance costs. In addition, cost of goods sold includes depreciation and amortization.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Updates\nThe reporting unit fair values of our reporting segments are based upon consideration of various valuation methodologies, one of which is projecting future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the risks involved ( Discounted Cash Flow\u201d or DCF\u201d). Assumptions used in a DCF require the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about appropriate discount rates and terminal values, growth rates, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The forecasted cash flows are based on current plans and for years beyond that plan, the estimates are based on assumed growth rates. We believe that our assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses. The discount rates, which are intended to reflect the risks inherent in future cash flow projections, used in a DCF are based on estimates of the weighted-average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) of a market participant. Such estimates are derived from our analysis of peer companies and consider the industry weighted average return on debt and equity from a market participant perspective.\nNet revenues from Tropicana AC comprised approximately 40% of our Gaming segment's net revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Net revenue for Tropicana AC increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period primarily due to increased customer volumes due, in part, to the closure of four competitors in Atlantic City in 2014. Based on market data, the Atlantic City market experienced year-over-year declines in casino revenue of 6.5% in the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year period; however, a comparison of year-over-year results for the remaining eight properties shows a 3.1% increase in total casino revenue in 2015 as compared to 2014. In addition, Tropicana AC casino revenues increased due to an increase in Internet gaming, coupled with 3.6% higher slot volumes, a 7.7% increase in table games volumes and a 9.4% decrease in the amount of promotional slot play redeemed, partially offset by a 1.1 percentage point decrease in the table hold percentage for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014.\nPowertrain and Motorparts are our only Automotive segment reporting units with goodwill allocated to it. While the fair value of our Automotive segment's Powertrain reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value, the Motorparts reporting unit failed \"Step 1\" of the goodwill impairment analysis. Based on \"Step 2\" of the goodwill impairment analysis of our Automotive segment's Motorparts reporting unit, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $312 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Due to the complexity in \"Step 2\" goodwill impairment test, we expect to finalize the assessment of our Automotive segment's goodwill impairment during the first quarter of 2016 and any resulting difference in the amount of the impairment will be adjusted at that time.\nDuring 2015, we paid dividends and distributions of $252 million to non-controlling interests in certain of our subsidiaries within our Energy and Railcar segments, as well as aggregate distributions to our general partner and LP unitholders of $116 million.\nThe IEH Auto acquisition contributed $396 million in net sales for the period June 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015. IEH Auto is a service organization engaged in the distribution of automotive aftermarket parts. Through its locations, IEH Auto sells predominantly to commercial aftermarket customers in the \"do-it-for-me\" market as well as \"do-it-yourself\" customers.\nSee Note 10, Debt - Automotive,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding Federal-Mogul's credit facilities.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nIn connection with recording a goodwill impairment charge of $253 million, representing the full amount of the remaining goodwill allocated to our Energy segment's Fertilizer reporting unit, we also performed an impairment test for long-lived assets for our Energy segment's fertilizer business, including finite-lived intangible assets, utilizing estimates of undiscounted future cash flows based on the use of the assets for their remaining useful life for our Energy segment's fertilizer business. The impairment test did not result in the impairment of any long-lived assets for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nEnergy\nConsolidated interest expense for Icahn Enterprises increased by $307 million (36%) during 2015 as compared to the corresponding prior year period. The increase for Icahn Enterprises Holdings was $307 million (36%). The increases were primarily due to higher interest expense from our Investment segment attributable to due to broker balances, higher interest expense from our Automotive segment due to higher outstanding debt balances on its revolver facility coupled with higher interest rates following the refinancing of its term loans and higher interest expense from our Railcar segments due to higher outstanding debt balances.\nOverview\nRailcar leasing revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year period due to an increase in number of railcars leased to customers and an increase in the average lease rate. Total railcars on lease at the end of 2014 were approximately 39,700 as compared to approximately 34,700 at the end of 2013.\nReturns\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Among others, estimates are used when accounting for valuation of investments and pension expense. Estimates used in determining fair value measurements include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flow assumptions, market rate assumptions for contractual obligations, actuarial assumptions for benefit plans, settlement plans for litigation and contingencies, and appropriate discount rates. Estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ from estimates.\nConsolidated Financial Results\nConsolidated net sales increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year by $472 million (6%) (net of certain intercompany activity), of which $396 million is attributable to the acquisition of IEH Auto during 2015 and $76 million is attributable to Federal-Mogul.\nDuring 2015, Mr. Icahn and his affiliates elected to receive a majority of their proportionate share of these distributions in depositary units. Mr. Icahn and his affiliates owned approximately 89.0% of Icahn Enterprises' outstanding depositary units as of December 31, 2015. Mr. Icahn and his affiliates have indicated that it is their present intention to elect to continue to receive the increase in Icahn Enterprises' cash distribution in additional depositary units for the foreseeable future.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, which amends FASB ASC Topic 810, Consolidations. This ASU amends the current consolidation guidance, including introducing a separate consolidation analysis specific to limited partnerships and other similar entities. This ASU requires that limited partnerships and similar legal entities provide partners with either substantive kick-out rights or substantive participating rights over the general partner in order to be considered a voting interest entity. The specialized consolidation model and guidance for limited partnerships and similar legal entities have been eliminated. There is no longer a presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership. For limited partnerships and similar legal entities that qualify as voting interest entities, a limited partner with a controlling financial interest should consolidate a limited partnership. A controlling financial interest may be achieved through holding a limited partner interest that provides substantive kick-out rights. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We believe that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and disclosures.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nFederal-Mogul has approved and initiated restructuring activities as a part of a broader initiative to improve operating performance and reduce costs. As such, Federal-Mogul will continue to evaluate its activities and opportunities to align its business with its executive management's strategy. Restructuring expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily related to EMEA locations and aimed to reduce production complexities and reducing inefficiencies in indirect and fixed cost structures. Federal-Mogul expects to complete these programs in 2017 and incur additional restructuring charges of approximately $10 million. For programs previously initiated, Federal-Mogul expects to complete these programs in 2018 and incur additional restructuring charges of approximately $10 million.\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, which amends FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. This ASU requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in FASB ASC Topic 718 as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. We believe that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and disclosures.\nFor 2014, Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings recognized a deferred tax benefit on its pre-tax loss primarily due to income tax benefits recorded on a release of valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets in our Gaming segment of $196 million.\nRecent Decline In Oil Prices\nTotal manufacturing revenues, before elimination of railcar sales to our Railcar segment's leasing operations, for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $1 million as compared to the corresponding prior year period. Although there was a higher volume of shipments in 2015 compared to 2014, there was a higher mix of hopper railcars in 2015, which generally sell at lower prices than tank railcars due to less material and labor content. Manufacturing revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 include revenues of $579 million relating to railcars built for our Railcar segment's leasing operations, compared to $641 million for the comparable prior year period.\nAssumptions used to calculate benefit obligations as of the end of a fiscal year directly affect the expense to be recognized in future periods. The primary assumptions affecting our accounting for employee benefits as of December 31, 2015 are as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2015 IEH Auto was in compliance with the covenants of the IEH Auto ABL Facility. See Note 10, \"Debt - Automotive,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding this credit facility.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nCurrent economic conditions continue to adversely impact Tropicana and the gaming industry as a whole. Tropicana believes its guests have reduced their discretionary spending as a result of uncertainty and instability relating to employment and the investment and housing markets. While general economic conditions have modestly improved, we cannot assure that they will continue to improve or will not worsen in the future.\nFederal-Mogul and Viskase did not record taxes on its undistributed earnings of $879 million and $66 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015, since these earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. If at some future date, these earnings cease to be permanently reinvested, Federal-Mogul and Viskase may be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on such amounts. Determining the unrecognized deferred tax liability on the potential distribution of these earnings is not practicable as such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing when remittance occurs.\n \u2022 Health care cost trend: For post-employment health care plan accounting, Federal-Mogul reviews external data and company specific historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate. The assumed health care cost trend rate used to measure next year's post-employment health care benefits is 6.97% for both health care drug costs, both declining to an ultimate trend rate of 5.00% in 2022. \nMining\nOur Food Packaging segment estimates that its capital expenditures for 2016 will be approximately $22 million.\nFerrous shipments decreased by 359,000 gross tons (30%) and average pricing decreased by $138 per gross ton (37%) for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year. The shipment decrease was attributable to reduced demand from domestic steel mills, low iron ore pricing, low export demand drawing coastal scrap into the areas where PSC Metals operates, and to the negative impact of extremely low market prices on the availability of feedstock. Ferrous market prices at the end of 2015 were at the lowest levels seen since early 2009, during the great recession. Non-ferrous shipment volumes decreased by 29,504,000 pounds (20%) and average selling prices decreased by $0.17 per pound (20%), primarily driven by the effects of steep market price declines in 2015. Shipments from an aluminum ingot tolling operation, closed at the end of March 2014, accounted for 24% of the year on year volume decrease for non-ferrous shipments.\nThe business of WestPoint Home LLC (\"WPH\") is significantly influenced by the overall economic environment, including consumer spending, at the retail level, for home textile products. Many of the larger retailers are customers of WPH. WPH will continue to realign its manufacturing operations and streamline its merchandising, sales and customer service divisions to improve its cost structure and better serve its customers. Given the uncertainty and volatility in the macroeconomic conditions, we cannot predict if WPH's financial performance will continue to improve.\nWe are a holding company. Our cash flow and our ability to meet our debt service obligations and make distributions with respect to depositary units likely will depend on the cash flow resulting from divestitures, equity and debt financings, interest income, returns on our interests in the Investment Funds and the payment of funds to us by our subsidiaries in the form of loans, dividends and distributions. We may pursue various means to raise cash from our subsidiaries. To date, such means include receipt of dividends and distributions from subsidiaries, obtaining loans or other financings based on the asset values of subsidiaries, or selling debt or equity securities of subsidiaries through capital markets transactions. To the degree any distributions and transfers are impaired or prohibited, our ability to make payments on our debt or distributions on our depositary units could be limited. The operating results of our subsidiaries may not be sufficient for them to make distributions to us. In addition, our subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to us, and distributions and intercompany transfers from our subsidiaries to us may be restricted by applicable law or covenants contained in debt agreements and other agreements.\nFor 2015, Icahn Enterprises Holdings recorded an income tax expense of $68 million on pre-tax loss of $2.1 billion compared to an income tax benefit of $103 million on pre-tax loss of $631 million for 2014. Icahn Enterprises Holdings effective income tax rate was (3.3)% and 16.3% for 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n\nConsolidated Cash Flows\nThe declaration and payment of distributions is reviewed quarterly by Icahn Enterprises GP's board of directors based upon a review of our balance sheet and cash flow, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities, our expected capital and liquidity requirements, the provisions of our partnership agreement and provisions in our financing arrangements governing distributions, and keeping in mind that limited partners subject to U.S. federal income tax have recognized income on our earnings even if they do not receive distributions that could be used to satisfy any resulting tax obligations. The payment of future distributions will be determined by the board of directors quarterly, based upon the factors described above and other factors that it deems relevant at the time that declaration of a distribution is considered. Payments of distributions are subject to certain restrictions, including certain restrictions on our subsidiaries which limit their ability to distribute dividends to us. There can be no assurance as to whether or in what amounts any future distributions might be paid.\nIt is impossible to predict precisely what effect these laws and regulations will have on our operations in the future. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may result in, among other things, capital expenditures, costs and liabilities. Management believes, based on past experience and its best assessment of future events, that these environmental liabilities and costs will be assessed and paid over an extended period of time. Management believes that recorded environmental liabilities will be adequate to cover estimated liability for exposure in respect to such matters. In the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded, our results of operations could be materially affected.\nOther Consolidated Results of Operations\nOur consolidated restructuring costs were $97 million and $84 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which were primarily attributable to our Automotive segment in each of the respective periods as discussed below.\nDue to the nature of certain of our operations, we may be subject to environmental remediation claims. Certain of our operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning discharges to the air, soil, surface and subsurface waters and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials and hazardous substances. Certain of our operations are also subject to other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations including those that require them to remove or mitigate the effects of the disposal or release of certain materials at\nThe fair value of our Energy segment's reporting unit is based upon consideration of various valuation methodologies, including a DCF analysis and pricing multiples of current and future earnings observed for comparable public companies. Assumptions used in a DCF require the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about appropriate discount rates and terminal values, growth rates, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The forecasted cash flows are based on current plans and for years beyond that plan, and the estimates are based on assumed growth rates. We believe that our assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses. The discount rates, which are intended to reflect the risks inherent in future cash flow projections, used in a DCF are based on estimates of the weighted-average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) of a market participant. Such estimates are derived from our analysis of peer companies and consider the industry weighted average return on debt and equity from a market participant perspective.\nOur Investment segment had net cash used in operating activities of $136 million primarily relating to its investment transactions. Additionally, our Holding Company had net cash used in operating activities of $270 million primarily due to payments of interest expense on its debt.\nThe consolidated cash flows of Icahn Enterprises Holdings and Icahn Enterprises are substantially the same. The minor differences between Icahn Enterprises Holdings' and Icahn Enterprises' consolidated statements of cash flows primarily relate to non-cash charges for interest expense which is presented in net cash flows used in operating activities. Therefore, we discuss only the consolidated cash flows of Icahn Enterprises below.\nInterest Expense\nNet cash used in investing activities for 2015 was primarily due to consolidated capital expenditures incurred by our subsidiaries and acquisitions of business. Our Railcar segment had capital expenditures of $522 million, of which $484 million was for the manufacturing or purchase of railcars for its leasing operations. Additionally, our Automotive and Energy segments had capital expenditures of $449 million and $219 million, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nMajor Influences Impacting Results of Operations\nGross margin from manufacturing operations, before eliminations relating to railcar sales to our Railcar segment's leasing operations, for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $271 million compared to $197 million for the comparable prior year period. Gross margin from manufacturing operations as a percentage of manufacturing revenues increased to 27% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 23% for the comparable prior year period. The improved margin was primarily due to ramped up production at our Railcar segment's hopper railcar manufacturing facility that created operating efficiencies and leveraged overhead costs. This was in addition to efficiencies that our Railcar segment continued to generate at its tank railcar manufacturing facility due to high production volumes.\nThe following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our present business and the results of operations together with our present financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (this \"Report\").\nOur operating businesses are managed on a decentralized basis. Due to the structure of our business, we discuss the results of operations below by individual reportable segments. Refer to Note 3, Operating Units,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements for a description of each of our reporting segments and Note 13, \"Segment and Geographic Reporting,\" for a reconciliation of each of our reporting segment's results of operations to our consolidated results.\n\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which amends FASB ASC Subtopic 835-30, Interest - Imputation of Interest. The new standard requires that all costs incurred to issue debt be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the debt. Given the absence of authoritative guidance within this ASU regarding debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit, the SEC staff has stated that it would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement. The standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and is required to be applied on a retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. We expect that the adoption of this new guidance will generally result in a reclassification of debt issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheets.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nRefining margin per barrel of crude oil throughput increased to $14.45 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $11.38 for the corresponding prior year period. Refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact increased to $15.31 per crude oil throughput barrel for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $13.62 per crude oil throughput barrel for the corresponding prior year period. Gross margin per barrel increased to $5.78 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to gross margin per barrel of $3.42 in the corresponding prior year period. The increase in refining margin and gross margin per barrel was primarily due to the higher unfavorable FIFO impact in 2014 as a result of significant decline in the market price of crude oil.\nOn February 11, 2013, we announced that the board of directors of our general partner approved a modification to our distribution policy to provide for an increase in the annual distribution from $1.40, comprised of $0.40 in cash and $1.00 in depositary units, to $4.00 per depositary unit, payable in either cash or additional depositary units, at the election of each\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nOn November 25, 2015, IEH Auto entered into a senior secured asset based revolving credit facility (the \"IEH Auto ABL Credit Facility\") for $125 million. On January 25, 2016, the ABL Credit Facility was amended and restated to increase the revolver commitments to $210 million. As of December 31, 2015, the IEH Auto ABL Facility had a balance of $75 million and $3 million in letters of credit. As of December 31, 2015, the availability on the IEH Auto ABL Credit Facility was $30 million.", "item_7_tables": "Table 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>
