Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and should be read together with the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for diseases and conditions of the eye using our proprietary hydrogel platform technology. Our bioresorbable hydrogel-based drug product candidates are designed to provide extended delivery of therapeutic agents to the eye. Our lead product candidates are DEXTENZA (dexamethasone insert), for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain, allergic conjunctivitis and dry eye disease, and OTX-TP for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension, which are extended-delivery, drug-eluting inserts that are placed into the canaliculus through a natural opening called the punctum located in the inner portion of the eyelid near the nose. Our intracanalicular inserts combine our hydrogel technology with U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved therapeutic agents with the goal of providing extended delivery of drug to the eye. We also have an intravitreal hydrogel depot which is in preclinical development for the treatment of diseases and conditions of the back of the eye including wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD. Our initial development efforts are focused on the use of our hydrogel depot in combination with anti-angiogenic drugs, such as protein-based anti-VEGF drugs or small molecule drugs, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or TKIs. Our intravitreal depot is designed to be delivered via injection to release therapeutic agents, such as antibodies to vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, over an extended period. We have entered into a collaboration, option and license with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Regeneron, for the development and potential commercialization of products containing our extended-delivery hydrogel depot in combination with Regeneron's large molecule VEGF-targeting compounds, with the initial focus on the VEGF trap aflibercept, currently marketed under the brand name Eylea. In addition to our ongoing product development, we currently market our first commercial product, ReSure Sealant, a hydrogel-based ophthalmic wound sealant approved by the FDA to seal corneal incisions following cataract surgery. ReSure Sealant is the first and only surgical sealant to be approved by the FDA for ophthalmic use.\nDEXTENZA\nOur most advanced product candidate, DEXTENZA, incorporates the FDA-approved corticosteroid dexamethasone as an active pharmaceutical ingredient into a hydrogel-based drug-eluting insert for intracanalicular use. In September 2015, we submitted to the FDA a New Drug Application, or NDA, for DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular pain. On July 25, 2016, we announced that we had received a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, from the FDA regarding our NDA for DEXTENZA. On January 23, 2017, we announced that we had resubmitted our NDA. On February 22, 2017, we announced that the FDA accepted for review our NDA resubmission. The FDA determined that our NDA resubmission is a complete response and designated the NDA resubmission as a class 2, or major, review with a target action date under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, of July 19, 2017.\nWe have completed three Phase 3 clinical trials of DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain. The data from these three completed Phase 3 clinical trials and a prior Phase 2 clinical trial are being used to support our NDA for post-surgical ocular pain. Subject to receiving approval for the pain indication pursuant to our NDA, we plan to submit an NDA supplement, or sNDA, for DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation. We have also completed two Phase 3 clinical trials of DEXTENZA for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. In October 2015, we announced topline results of our first Phase 3 clinical trial for allergic conjunctivitis, and in June 2016 we announced topline results of our second Phase 3 clinical trial for this indication. Finally, DEXTENZA is in Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of dry eye disease. We announced topline results from an exploratory Phase 2 clinical trial for this indication in December 2015. We are assessing our plans for our dry eye program going forward and may focus future efforts on an intracanalicular insert containing an immunosuppressant drug.\nOTX-TP\nOur second product candidate, OTX-TP, incorporates travoprost, an FDA-approved prostaglandin analog that reduces elevated intraocular pressure, or IOP, as its active pharmaceutical ingredient, into a hydrogel-based drug-eluting intracanalicular insert. OTX-TP is being developed as a treatment for glaucoma and ocular hypertension. We reported topline results from a Phase 2b clinical trial for this indication in October 2015. We completed an End-of-Phase 2 review with the FDA in April 2016 and initiated the first of two Phase 3 clinical trials of OTX-TP in September 2016.\nBack-of-the-Eye Programs\nIn addition to DEXTENZA and OTX-TP, we are engaged in the preclinical development of our hydrogel depot administered via intravitreal injection to address the large and growing markets for diseases and conditions of the back of the eye. Our initial development efforts are focused on the use of our extended-delivery hydrogel depot in combination with anti-angiogenic drugs, such as protein-based anti-VEGF drugs or small molecule drugs, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or TKIs, for the treatment of retinal diseases such as wet AMD, retinal vein occlusion and diabetic macular edema. Our initial goal for these programs is to provide extended delivery of a protein-based large molecule or small molecule TKI drug targeting VEGF and other targets over a four to six month period following administration of a bioresorbable hydrogel incorporating the drug by an injection into the vitreous humor, thereby reducing the frequency of the current monthly or bi-monthly intravitreal injection regimen for wet AMD and other retinal diseases and potentially providing a more consistent uniform release of drug over the treatment period.\nRegeneron Collaboration\nIn October 2016, we entered into a strategic collaboration, option and license agreement, or Collaboration Agreement, with Regeneron for the development and potential commercialization of products containing our extended-delivery hydrogel depot in combination with Regeneron's large molecule VEGF-targeting compounds for the treatment of retinal diseases, with the initial focus on the VEGF trap aflibercept, currently marketed under the brand name Eylea. The Collaboration Agreement does not cover the development of any products that deliver small molecule drugs, including TKIs, for any target including VEGF, or any products that deliver large molecule drugs other than those that target VEGF proteins. We granted Regeneron an option, or the Option, to enter into an exclusive, worldwide license under our intellectual property to develop and commercialize products containing our extended-delivery hydrogel depot in combination with Regeneron's large molecule VEGF-targeting compounds, or Licensed Products.\nIf the Option is exercised, Regeneron will conduct further preclinical development and an initial clinical trial under a collaboration plan. We are obligated to reimburse Regeneron for certain development costs during the period through the completion of the initial clinical trial, subject to a cap of $25 million, which cap may be increased by up to $5 million under certain circumstances. Regeneron will be responsible for funding an initial preclinical tolerability study. We do not expect our funding requirements to be material over the next twelve months. If Regeneron elects to proceed with further development beyond the initial clinical trial, it will be solely responsible for conducting and funding further development and commercialization of product candidates.\nUnder the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Regeneron has agreed to pay us $10 million upon exercise of the Option. We are also eligible to receive up to $145 million per Licensed Product upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones, including successful results from the first-in-human clinical trial, $100 million per Licensed Product upon first commercial sale of such Licensed Product and up to $50 million based on the achievement of specified sales milestones for all Licensed Products. In addition, we are entitled to tiered, escalating royalties, in a range from a high-single digit to a low-to-mid teen percentage of net sales of Licensed Products.\nReSure\nFollowing our receipt of FDA approval for ReSure Sealant, we commercially launched this product in the United States in 2014, initially through a network of ophthalmology-focused distributors. In early 2017, we terminated these distributors and hired a contract sales force of four representatives to sell ReSure Sealant. ReSure Sealant is approved to seal corneal incisions following cataract surgery and is the first and only surgical sealant to be approved by the FDA for ophthalmic use. In the pivotal clinical trials that formed the basis for FDA approval, ReSure Sealant provided superior wound closure and a better safety profile than sutured closure.\nFinancial Position\nWe have generated limited revenue to date. In the first quarter of 2014, we began recognizing revenue from sales of ReSure Sealant. All of our sustained drug delivery products are in various phases of clinical and preclinical development. We do not expect sales of ReSure Sealant to generate revenue that is sufficient for us to achieve profitability. Instead, our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on our obtaining marketing approval for and commercializing products with greater market potential, including one or both of DEXTENZA and OTX-TP. Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $44.7 million, $39.7 million and $28.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $173.9 million.\nOur total cost and operating expenses were $45.2 million, $39.9 million and $27.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, including $6.0 million, $4.6 million and $5.0 million, respectively, in non-cash stock-based compensation expense and licensing and consulting fees paid in stock. We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase substantially as we pursue the clinical development of our most advanced product candidates, DEXTENZA and OTX-TP, continue the research and development of our other product candidates, continue the internal development of our intravitreal hydrogel depot for the sustained delivery of protein-based or small molecule anti-angiogenic drugs, such as anti-VEGF drugs for the treatment of wet AMD and other back-of-the-eye diseases and seek marketing approval for any such product candidate for which we obtain favorable pivotal clinical trial results. We expect to continue to incur substantial additional expenses for product manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution for our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.\nWe do not expect to generate significant revenue from sales of any product for several years, if at all. Accordingly, we may need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to access our borrowing capacity or raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts or to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nIn July 2014, we completed an initial public offering, or IPO, of our common stock, and in August 2014 the underwriters in our IPO exercised their over-allotment option in full. We received total net proceeds of approximately $66.4 million from the issuance and sale of 5,750,000 shares of common stock, including in connection with the exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering costs. In June 2015, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock at a public offering price of $22.00 per share. The offering consisted of 4,600,000 shares of common stock, of which 3,200,000 shares were issued and sold by us and 1,400,000 shares were sold by certain of our stockholders, including those shares sold in connection with the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. We received net proceeds from the follow-on offering of approximately $65.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. In November 2016, we entered into an At-the-Market Sales Agreement, or the 2016 ATM Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., or Cantor, under which we may offer and sell our common stock having aggregate proceeds of up to $40.0 million from time to time. As of February 28, 2017, we have sold 263,418 shares of common stock under the 2016 ATM Agreement at a weighted average exercise price of $8.87 per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately $2.0 million after underwriting discounts, commission and other offering expenses. In January 2017, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock at a public offering price of $7.00 per share. The offering consisted of 3,571,429 shares of common stock sold by us. We received net proceeds from the follow-on offering of approximately $23.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts expenses. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, will enable us to fund our operating expenses, debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2018. We will need to obtain additional capital to the support the planned commercial launch of DEXTENZA, subject to FDA approval. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nFrom our inception through December 31, 2016, we have generated limited amounts of revenue from the sales of our products. Our ReSure Sealant product received premarket approval, or PMA, from the FDA in January 2014. We commenced sales of ReSure Sealant in the first quarter of 2014, have received only limited revenues from ReSure Sealant to date and anticipate only limited sales for 2017. ReSure Sealant is currently our only source of revenue from product sales. We may generate revenue in the future if we successfully develop one or more of our product candidates and receive marketing approval for any such product candidate or if we enter into longer-term collaboration agreements with third parties.\nIn September 2013, we entered into a feasibility agreement with a biopharmaceutical company relating to our intravitreal drug delivery depot. Under this agreement, the biopharmaceutical company agreed to pay us up to $0.5 million under this feasibility study. In the event that the agreement was terminated in advance of the achievement of certain milestones, we would have been required to refund certain portions of the funding based on the actual work completed or milestones achieved as of the date of termination. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company completed the task related to the first milestone at which time the $0.3 million became non-refundable. The biopharmaceutical company has indicated that they will not proceed with the second phase of the agreement. The Company does not have any further obligations in connection with this agreement.\nWe entered into a feasibility agreement with a biotechnology company relating to our intravitreal drug delivery depot in October 2014. Under this agreement, the biotechnology company had agreed to pay us up to $0.7 million, of which $0.3 million was a non-refundable up-front payment due upon contract execution and $0.4 million will be due upon the achievement of certain milestones. Initially, we were recognizing the non-refundable, non-contingent up-front payment of $0.3 million as revenue on a straight-line basis over the twelve-month period in which we are expected to complete our performance obligations. Estimates of this development period involves the evaluation of many assumptions and uncertainties and may change if facts and circumstances change. During 2015, management reevaluated and revised the estimated development period to extend through March 2016. If and when a contingent milestone payment is earned, the additional consideration to be received will be added to the total expected payments under the contract and recognized as revenue based on the proportional performance methodology. In January 2015, we achieved the first milestone under the feasibility agreement triggering a payment due of $0.3 million. This agreement was terminated in the second quarter of 2016 and the Company does not have any further obligations. Through December 31, 2016, the Company had recognized revenue of $0.5 million related to this agreement.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include:\nTable 336: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nemployee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development, clinical and regulatory and other related functions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 337: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nexpenses incurred in connection with the clinical trials of our product candidates, including with the investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials and under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 338: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nexpenses relating to regulatory activities, including filing fees paid to the FDA for our submissions for product approvals;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 339: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nexpenses associated with developing our pre-commercial manufacturing capabilities and manufacturing clinical study materials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 340: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nongoing research and development activities relating to our core bioresorbable hydrogel technology and improvements to this technology;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 341: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nfacilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and supplies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 342: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncosts relating to the supply and manufacturing of product inventory, prior to approval by the FDA or other regulatory agencies of our products;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 343: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nexpenses associated with preclinical development activities; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 344: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nroyalty and patent legal fees payable made under our licensing agreement with Incept, LLC, or Incept.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our vendors and our clinical investigative sites.\nOur direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to investigators, consultants, central laboratories and CROs in connection with our clinical trials and regulatory fees. We do not allocate employee and contractor-related costs, costs associated with our platform technology, costs related to manufacturing or purchasing clinical trial materials, and facility expenses, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific product development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product development programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We use internal resources in combination with third-party CROs, including clinical monitors and clinical research associates, to manage our clinical trials, monitor patient enrollment and perform data analysis for many of our clinical trials. These employees work across multiple development programs and, therefore, we do not track their costs by program.\nThe table below summarizes our research and development expenses incurred by product development program:\nTable 345: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReSure Sealant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDEXTENZA for post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,686 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,058 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,151 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDEXTENZA for allergic conjunctivitis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,815 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,541 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,785 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDEXTENZA for dry eye disease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOTX-TP for glaucoma and ocular hypertension\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,941 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,048 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,023 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUnallocated expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19,286 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,972 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12,881 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n27,065 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n26,611 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n18,880 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect that our expenses will increase in connection with our ongoing activities. We estimate that in 2017, we will incur approximately $33.0 million to $35.0 million of research and development expenses, including costs related to clinical trials and other research and development activities. Of this amount, we estimate we will incur approximately $17.0 million to $19.0 million of external research and development expenses related to clinical trial and regulatory costs for our DEXTENZA and OTX-TP product candidates and approximately $15.0 million to $16.0 million of other research and development activities that we do not expect to track by program. We expect that our total costs to renovate our new facility, including research and development laboratories, manufacturing space and office space will be approximately $3.6 million, net of a landlord provided construction allowance of up to $2.8 million. In addition, we expect to purchase $2.0 million to $2.5 million in manufacturing and research and development capital equipment for our new facility.\nWe estimate that we will incur external research and development expenses for 2017, as follows:\nTable 346: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\napproximately $2.0 million to $2.8 million for DEXTENZA for post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 347: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\napproximately $1.0 million to $1.2 million for DEXTENZA for allergic conjunctivitis;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 348: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\napproximately $12.0 million to $15.0 million for OTX-TP for glaucoma and ocular hypertension; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 349: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\napproximately $0.9 million to $1.2 million for other external research and development activities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the uncertainty of:\nTable 350: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe scope, progress, outcome and costs of our clinical trials and other research and development activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 351: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe efficacy and potential advantages of our product candidates compared to alternative treatments, including any standard of care;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 352: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe market acceptance of our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 353: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nsignificant and changing government regulation; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 354: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe timing, receipt and terms of any marketing approvals.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAny changes in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates in clinical and preclinical development could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of these product candidates. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials or other testing beyond those that we currently expect or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development of that product candidate.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include facility-related costs and professional fees for legal, patent, consulting and accounting and audit services.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued development and commercialization of our product candidates. We also anticipate to continue to incur increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance, director and officer insurance costs as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with being a public company.\nSelling and Marketing Expenses\nSelling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel in selling and marketing functions as well as consulting and advertising and promotion costs. Through December 31, 2014, we incurred selling and marketing expenses in connection with our first-generation surgical sealant product. In addition, we invested in sales and marketing resources in anticipation of an earlier approval of our surgical sealant product in the United States than we ultimately received from the FDA, as a result of a change in designation from a 510(k) to a PMA regulatory path. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we incurred selling and marketing expense in connection with ReSure Sealant, which we began commercializing in the first quarter of 2014.\nWe expect selling and marketing expenses to increase in preparation for the potential approval of our resubmitted NDA by the FDA and commercial launch of our DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of post-surgical ocular pain. We expect such expenses to further increase in preparation for the potential label expansion to include post-surgical ocular inflammation, subject to submission and approval of an NDA supplement.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Income. Interest income consists primarily of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. In each of 2016, 2015, and 2014, our interest income has not been significant due to the low rates of interest being earned on our invested balances.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense consists of interest expense on our debt. We borrowed $15.0 million in aggregate principal amount in April 2014. In December 2015, we amended our credit facility to increase the aggregate principal amount to $15.6 million, extend the interest-only payment period through December 2016, and extend the maturity date to December 1, 2019.\nOther Income (Expense), Net. In 2014, other income (expense), net consisted primarily of the gain or loss associated with the change in the fair value of our preferred stock warrant liability and small amounts of miscellaneous income and expense items unrelated to core operations. We issued warrants for the purchase of our redeemable convertible preferred stock that we believed were financial instruments that could require a transfer of assets because of the redemption feature of the underlying stock. Therefore, we classified these warrants as liabilities and they were remeasured to fair value at each reporting period, and we recorded the changes in the fair value as a component of other income (expense), net. Upon the closing of our IPO in July 2014, the underlying redeemable convertible preferred stock was converted into common stock, the preferred stock warrants became exercisable for common stock instead of preferred stock, and the fair value of the warrant liability became fixed as of that date and was reclassified to additional paid-in capital. In 2015 and 2016, other income (expense), net consists of small amounts of miscellaneous income and expense items unrelated to our core operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, accrued research and development expenses and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report, we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when the following four criteria are met in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 605, Revenue Recognition: persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; delivery of goods has occurred through transfer of title and risk and rewards of ownership; the selling price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.\nWe record revenue from product sales net of applicable provisions for returns, chargebacks, discounts, wholesaler management fees, government and commercial rebates, and other applicable allowances in the same period in which the related sales are recorded, based on the underlying contract terms.\nWe analyze multiple-element arrangements based on the guidance in ASC Topic 605-25, Revenue Recognition-Multiple-Element Arrangements, or ASC 605-25. Pursuant to this guidance, we evaluate multiple-element arrangements to determine (1) the deliverables included in the arrangement and (2) whether the individual deliverables represent separate units of accounting or whether they must be accounted for as a combined unit of accounting. This evaluation involves subjective determinations and requires us to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting provided that the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and, if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control. In assessing whether an item has standalone value, we consider factors such as the research, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether the collaboration partner can use the other deliverables for their intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining elements, whether the value of the deliverable is dependent on the undelivered item and whether there are other vendors that can provide the undelivered elements.\nWe allocate arrangement consideration that is fixed or determinable among the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price method. Then, we apply the applicable revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605 to each of the separate units of accounting in determining the appropriate period and pattern of recognition. We determine the selling price of a unit of accounting following the hierarchy of evidence prescribed by ASC 605-25. Accordingly, we determine the estimated selling price for units of accounting within each arrangement using vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price, if available; third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price, if VSOE is not available; or best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. We typically use BESP to estimate the selling price as we generally do not have VSOE or TPE of selling price for our units of accounting. Determining the BESP for a unit of accounting requires significant judgment. In developing the BESP for a unit of accounting, we consider applicable market conditions and relevant entity-specific factors, including factors that were contemplated in negotiating the agreement with our customer and estimated costs. We validate the BESP for units of accounting by evaluating whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the BESP will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between multiple units of accounting.\nWe recognize arrangement consideration allocated to each unit of accounting when all of the revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605 are satisfied for that particular unit of accounting. We will recognize as revenue arrangement consideration attributed to licenses that have standalone value relative to the other deliverables to be provided in an arrangement upon delivery. We will recognize as revenue arrangement consideration attributed to licenses that do not have standalone value relative to the other deliverables to be provided in an arrangement over our estimated performance period, as the arrangement would be accounted for as a single unit of accounting.\nAt the inception of an arrangement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether: (1) the consideration is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone, (2) the consideration relates solely to past performance, and (3) the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone and the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether a milestone satisfies all of the criteria required to conclude that a milestone is substantive. Accordingly, pursuant to the guidance of ASC Topic 605-28, Revenue Recognition-Milestone Method, or ASC 605-28, revenue from milestone payments will be recognized in its entirety upon successful accomplishment of the milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nOther contingent, event-based payments received for which payment is either contingent solely upon the passage of time or the results of a collaborative partner's performance would not be considered milestones under ASC 605-28. In accordance with ASC 605-25, such payments will be recognized as revenue when all of the four basic revenue recognition criteria are met.\nWhenever we determine that an element is delivered over a period of time, revenue is recognized using either a proportional performance model or a straight-line model over the period of performance. At each reporting period, we reassess our cumulative measure of performance and make appropriate adjustments, if necessary. We recognize revenue using the proportional performance model whenever we can make reasonably reliable estimates of the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement. Revenue recognized under the proportional performance model at each reporting period is determined by multiplying the total expected payments under the contract (excluding payments contingent upon achievement of milestones) by the ratio of the level of effort incurred to date to the estimated total level of effort required to complete the performance obligations under the arrangement. Revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned, as determined using the proportional performance model as of each reporting period. Alternatively, if we cannot make reasonably reliable estimates the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement, then revenue under the arrangement is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period expected to complete our performance obligations. If and when a contingent milestone payment is earned, the additional consideration to be received is added to the total expected payments under the contract. Revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned, as determined on a straight-line basis as of the period end date. If we cannot reasonably estimate when our performance obligation period ends, then revenue is deferred until we can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation period ends.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advanced payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\nTable 355: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ninvestigative sites or other providers in connection with clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 356: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nvendors in connection with preclinical development activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 357: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCROs in connection with clinical trials; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 358: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nvendors related to product manufacturing, development and distribution of clinical supplies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple CROs that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed, enrollment of patients, number of sites activated and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, we have not made any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure all stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees and directors at the fair value on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We recognize the fair value of the awards as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We apply the straight-line method of expense recognition to all awards with service-only conditions.\nFor stock-based awards granted to consultants and nonemployees, we recognize compensation expense over the period during which services are rendered by such consultants and nonemployees until completed. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to completion of the service, we remeasure the fair value of these awards using the then-current fair value of our common stock and updated assumption inputs in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\nWe estimate the fair value of each stock option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Use of this model requires that we make assumptions as to the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. Prior to our IPO, we had been a private company and lacked company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, we estimate our expected volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded group of peer companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our publicly traded stock price. Beginning in 2016, we estimate our expected volatility using a weighted average of the historical volatility of our publicly traded peer companies and the volatility of our common stock, and expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our traded stock price. We use the simplified method prescribed by Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate the expected term of options granted to employees and directors. We base the expected term of options granted to consultants and nonemployees on the contractual term of the options. We determine the risk-free interest rate by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe assumptions we used to determine the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors are as follows, presented on a weighted average basis:\nTable 359: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRisk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.42 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n1.67 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n2.24 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExpected term (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExpected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExpected dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese assumptions represented our best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different. We recognize compensation expense for only the portion of awards that are expected to vest. In developing a forfeiture rate estimate for pre-vesting forfeitures, we have considered our historical experience of actual forfeitures. If our future actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, our stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period.\nInventory Valuation\nInventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, determined by the first-in, first-out method. Prior to initial approval by the FDA or other regulatory agencies of our products, we expense costs relating to the production of inventory in the period incurred as research and development expenses. After such time as the product receives approval, we begin to capitalize the inventory costs related to the product.\nSubsequent to the approval of ReSure Sealant in January 2014, we started to capitalize inventory of this product. We review our inventories for potential obsolescence.\nJOBS Act\nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and may remain an emerging growth company for up to five years. As an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include:\nTable 360: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nnot being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 361: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nnot being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 362: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nreduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 363: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nexemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect to continue to take advantage of some or all of the available exemptions.\nIn addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to delay such adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 364: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProduct revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,845 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,354 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCollaboration revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(354) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,887 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,750 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCost and operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCost of product revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResearch and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27,065 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26,611 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSelling and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,701 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,852 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,849 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,004 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,165 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,839 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal costs and operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n45,213 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39,947 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,266 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(43,326) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(38,197) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5,129) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,680) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,724) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal other expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,377) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,551) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(44,703) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(39,748) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(4,955) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nWe generated $1.8 and $1.4 million of product revenue during the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, from sales of our ReSure Sealant product.

The increase of $0.4 million was primarily due to a decrease of $2.9 million in clinical trial and regulatory expenses and an increase of $3.3 million in unallocated expenses. Clinical trial and regulatory expenses decreased in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the timing and number of clinical trials being conducted for the DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis and dry eye disease.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $7.6 million in direct research and development expenses for our intracanalicular insert product candidates, including $2.7 million for our DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain which was in Phase 3 clinical trials, $2.8 million for our DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis which was in Phase 3 clinical trials, $0.1 million for our DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of dry eye disease which was in Phase 2 clinical trials, and $2.0 million for our OTX-TP product candidate for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension which was in Phase 3 clinical trials. In comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $10.3 million in direct research and development expenses for our intracanalicular insert product candidates, including $2.0 million for clinical trials of OTX-TP for glaucoma and ocular hypertension which was in Phase 2b clinical trials, $5.5 million for our DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis which was in Phase 3 clinical trials and $2.1 million for our DEXTENZA for ocular inflammation and pain following cataract surgery which was in Phase 3 clinical trials and $0.7 million for our DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of dry eye disease which was in Phase 2 clinical trials. Unallocated research and development costs increased $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in unallocated personnel costs of $2.3 million, relating to additional hiring primarily in our clinical, regulatory and quality department and an increase in stock-based compensation expense and the write off of $1.3 million of equipment that was in construction in process that is included in all other costs.\nSelling and Marketing Expenses\nTable 366: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPersonnel related (including stock-based compensation)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,580 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,508 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,072 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProfessional fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,993 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,625 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,368 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFacility related and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,128 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal selling and marketing expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,701 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,852 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,849 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling and marketing expenses were $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

The increase of $2.3 million was due to a $0.8 million increase in personnel related costs and an increase of $1.6 million in professional fees, partially offset by a decrease of $0.1 million in facility-related and other costs. Our personnel related costs increased due primarily to hiring in our general and administrative function. Professional fees increased primarily due to increased activities to support our operating as a public company for a full year.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther expense, net was $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $44.7 million, $39.7 million and $28.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $173.9 million.\nWe have generated limited revenue to date. In the first quarter of 2014, we began recognizing revenue from sales of ReSure Sealant. All of our sustained drug delivery products are in various phases of clinical and preclinical development. We do not expect sales of ReSure Sealant to generate revenue that is sufficient for us to achieve profitability. Instead, our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on our obtaining marketing approval for and commercializing products with greater market potential, including one or both of DEXTENZA and OTX-TP.\nThrough December 31, 2016, we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our preferred stock, public offerings of our common stock and borrowings under credit facilities. In July 2014, we completed our IPO, and in August 2014 the underwriters in our IPO exercised their over-allotment option in full. We received total net proceeds of approximately $66.4 million from the issuance and sale of 5,750,000 shares of common stock, including in connection with the exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering costs. In June 2015, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock at a public offering price of $22.00 per share. The offering consisted of 4,600,000 shares of common stock, of which 3,200,000 shares were issued and sold by us and 1,400,000 shares were sold by certain stockholders, including those shares sold in connection with the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. We received net proceeds from the follow-on offering of approximately $65.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and offering expenses. In November 2016, we entered into the 2016 ATM Agreement with Cantor, under which we may offer and sell our common stock having aggregate proceeds of up to $40.0 million from time to time. To date, we have sold 263,418 shares of common stock under the 2016 ATM Agreement at a weighted average exercise price of $8.87 per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately $2.0 million after underwriting discounts, commission and other offering expenses. In January 2017, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock at a public offering price of $7.00 per share. The offering consisted of 3,571,429 shares of common stock sold by us. We received net proceeds from the follow-on offering of approximately $23.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts expenses.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $68.1 million. In April 2014, we borrowed $15.0 million in aggregate principal amount under a new credit facility and used $1.9 million of this amount to repay $1.7 million aggregate principal amount of indebtedness and pay $0.2 million of other amounts due in connection with our termination of a prior credit facility. In December 2015, we amended our credit facility to increase the aggregate principal amount to $15.6 million, extend the interest-only payment period through December\n2016, and extend the maturity date to December 1, 2019. The outstanding borrowings under this facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to 8.25%. In March 2017, we amended the credit facility to increase the total commitment to $38.0 million including $18.0 million of borrowings drawn at closing, which was used primarily to pay-off outstanding balances as of the closing date, and options on two additional tranches of $10.0 million each contingent on the achievement of regulatory and commercial milestones for DEXTENZA. The interest-only payment period was extended through February 1, 2018 and there are provisions to further extend the interest-only period based on the achievement of certain milestones. See -Contractual Obligations and Commitments\u201d for additional information.\nCash Flows\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $68.1 million. Cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy, primarily with a view to liquidity and capital preservation.\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:\nTable 372: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(34,001) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(33,743) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(20,496) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n35,568 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(38,569) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(38,586) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n65,703 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n78,970 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,152 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(6,609) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n19,888 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating activities. Net cash used in operating activities was $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily resulting from our net loss of $44.7 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $7.2 million and cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $2.1 million. Our net loss was primarily attributed to research and development activities and our general and administrative expenses partially offset by $1.9 million of revenue in the period. Our net non-cash charges during the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily consisted of $6.0 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.9 million of depreciation expense. Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted primarily of a $1.4 million increase in accrued expenses and deferred rent, a $0.9 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a $0.2 million increase in accounts payable, which was due to the timing of vendor invoicing and payments.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $33.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily resulting from our net loss of $39.7 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $5.6 million and cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $0.5 million. Our net loss was primarily attributed to research and development activities and our general and administrative expenses partially offset by $1.8 million of revenue in the period. Our net non-cash charges during the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily consisted of $4.6 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million of depreciation expense. Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of a $0.2 million increase in accrued expenses and deferred rent and a $0.3 million increase in accounts payable, which was due to the timing of vendor invoicing and payments, both partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $0.1 million.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $20.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily resulting from our net loss of $28.6 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $6.0 million and cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $2.2 million. Our net loss was primarily attributed to research and development activities and our general and administrative expenses partially offset by $0.8 million of revenue in the period. Our net non-cash charges during the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily consisted of $2.4 million of licensing and consultant fees paid in common stock, $2.6 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.5 million of depreciation expense. Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted primarily of a $1.9 million increase in accrued expenses and deferred rent and a $0.5 million increase in accounts payable, which was due to the timing of vendor invoicing and payments, both partially offset by an increase in inventory of $0.1 million.\nInvesting activities. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of maturities of marketable securities of $80.7 million offset by cash used to purchase property and equipment of $1.9 million and cash used to purchase marketable securities of $41.7 million. Net cash used in investing activities for the\nyear ended December 31, 2015 consisted of cash used to purchase property and equipment of $1.8 million and cash used to purchase marketable securities of $91.7 million offset by maturities of marketable securities of $54.8 million. Net cash used by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted of cash used to purchase property and equipment of $1.3 million and cash used to purchase marketable securities of $37.3 million. Purchases of property and equipment in 2014 consisted primarily of laboratory equipment, inclusive of building a clean room, which we commenced in 2013.\nFinancing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2016 was $0.6 million and consisted primarily of proceeds of $0.6 million, net of underwriting discounts and other offering expenses, related to the 2016 ATM Agreement, proceeds from the exercise of common stock options of $0.2 million; and proceeds from issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan of $0.3 million partially offset by payments of $0.5 million for insurance costs financed by a third party. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2015 was $65.7 million and consisted primarily of proceeds of $65.6 million, net of underwriting discounts and other offering expenses, related to our follow-on offering, $1.5 million (net) in borrowings under our amended 2014 credit facility, proceeds from the exercise of common stock options of $0.2 million; and proceeds from issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan of $0.2 million partially offset by repayment of $1.5 million of outstanding principal under our 2014 credit facility, payments of $0.8 million for insurance costs financed by a third party. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2014 was $79.0 million and consisted primarily of proceeds of $69.5 million, net of underwriters discount related to our IPO, and $14.9 million from our new credit facility, under which we borrowed $15.0 million in aggregate principal amount in April 2014, partially offset by the payment of issuance costs of $3.0 million in connection with our IPO and the repayment of $2.3 million of outstanding principal and other amounts due in connection with our termination of a prior credit facility and repayments of principal prior to our termination of the credit facility.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the clinical trials of our products in development and increase our sales and marketing resources focused on the potential launch of our product candidates including DEXTENZA, subject to receiving FDA approval.\nWe anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:\nTable 373: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncontinue to pursue the clinical development of our most advanced intracanalicular insert product candidates, DEXTENZA and OTX-TP;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 374: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nconduct joint research and development under our strategic collaboration with Regeneron for the development and potential commercialization of products containing our extended-delivery hydrogel depot in combination with Regeneron's large molecule VEGF-targeting compounds to treat retinal diseases;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 375: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncontinue the research and development of our other product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 376: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nseek to identify and develop additional product candidates, including through preclinical development activities associated with our back-of-the-eye program;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 377: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nseek marketing approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical development;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 378: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ndevelop and expand our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any of our product candidates, including DEXTENZA, for which we may obtain marketing approval;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 379: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nscale up our manufacturing processes and capabilities to support sales of commercial products, our ongoing clinical trials of our product candidates and commercialization of any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval, and expand our facilities to accommodate this scale up and the expected growth in personnel;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 380: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nrenovate our new facility, including research and development laboratories, manufacturing space and office space;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 381: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nmaintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 382: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nexpand our operational, financial and management systems and personnel, including personnel to support our clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts and our operations as a public company;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 383: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nincrease our product liability and clinical trial insurance coverage as we expand our clinical trials and commercialization efforts; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 384: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncontinue to operate as a public company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on our current plans and forecasted expenses, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will enable us to fund our operating expenses, debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2018. We will need to obtain additional capital to support the planned commercial launch of DEXTENZA, subject to FDA approval. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\nTable 385: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates by the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities, including our current NDA for DEXTENZA;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 386: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe level of product sales from any additional product for which we obtain marketing approval in the future;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 387: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe costs of manufacturing, sales, marketing, distribution and other commercialization efforts with respect to any additional products for which we obtain marketing approval in the future;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 388: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe costs of expanding our facilities to accommodate our manufacturing needs and expected growth in personnel;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 389: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe progress, costs and outcome of the clinical trials of our extended-delivery drug delivery product candidates, in particular DEXTENZA and OTX-TP;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 390: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe progress and status of our collaboration with Regeneron, including any development costs for which we reimburse Regeneron, the potential exercise by Regeneron of its option for a license for the development and potential commercialization of products containing our extended-delivery hydrogel depot in combination with Regeneron's large molecule VEGF-targeting compounds, and our potential receipt of future milestone payments from Regeneron;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 391: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe costs of advancing our internal development efforts for the back-of-the-eye program through the remaining preclinical steps and potentially into an initial clinical trial;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 392: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe scope, progress, costs and outcome of preclinical development and clinical trials of our other product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 393: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe amounts we receive, if any, from Regeneron for option exercise, development, regulatory and sales milestones and royalty payments under our collaboration;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 394: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe extent to which we choose to establish additional collaboration, distribution or other marketing arrangements for our products and product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 395: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 396: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe extent to which we acquire or invest in other businesses, products and technologies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate product revenues sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of revenue from sales of ReSure Sealant, equity offerings, debt financings,\ngovernment or other third-party funding, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and marketing and distribution arrangements. We do not have any committed external source of funds other than amounts we may receive from Regeneron for potential option exercise, development, regulatory and sales milestones and royalties under our collaboration and amounts we may be able to draw under our amended credit facility upon the achievement of regulatory and commercial milestones. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. The covenants under our existing credit facility, the pledge of our assets as collateral and the negative pledge of intellectual property limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing. If we raise additional funds through government or other third-party funding, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nSince our inception in 2006, we have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in each year or our earned research and development tax credits, due to our uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items. As of December 31, 2016, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $85.2 million, which begin to expire in 2026, and state net operating loss carryforwards of $73.9 million, which begin to expire in 2029. As of December 31, 2016, we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of $4.1 million and state research and development tax credit carryforwards $2.1 million, which begin to expire in 2026 and 2025, respectively. We have not completed a study to assess whether an ownership change, generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in the equity ownership of our corporate entity over a three-year period, has occurred or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since our inception, due to the significant costs and complexities associated with such studies. Accordingly, our ability to utilize our tax carryforwards may be limited. Additionally, U.S. tax laws limit the time during which these carryforwards may be utilized against future taxes. As a result, we may not be able to take full advantage of these carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2016 and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods:\nTable 397: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 to 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3 to 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore than\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating lease commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14,373 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,162 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,696 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,575 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,940 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchase commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,416 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,185 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,231 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNew facility improvements, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,600 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,600 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nManufacturing commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,680 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDebt obligations including interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20,100 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,723 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17,377 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n43,169 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10,510 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n22,144 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,575 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,940 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the table above, we set forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations and future commitments at December 31, 2016, as well as obligations related to contracts that we are likely to continue, regardless of the fact that they may be cancelable at December 31, 2016. Some of the figures that we include in this table are based on management's estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, and other factors. Because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table.\nOperating lease commitments represent payments due under our leases of office, laboratory and manufacturing space in Bedford, Massachusetts and certain office equipment under operating leases that expire in June 2017 and June 2018.\nOn June 17, 2016, we entered into a lease agreement for approximately 70,712 square feet of general office, research and development and manufacturing space. The lease expires on July 31, 2027. No base rent will be due under the lease until August 1, 2017. The initial annual base rent is approximately $1.2 million and will increase annually beginning on February 1 of each year. We are obligated to pay all real estate taxes and costs related to the premises, including costs of operations, maintenance, repair, and replacement and management of the new leased premises. We posted a customary letter of credit in the amount of $1.5 million as a security deposit. We intend to relocate our corporate headquarters to the new leased premises beginning in 2017 and expect to relocate all of our operations to the new leased premises by 2018. The lease agreement allows for a construction allowance not to exceed approximately $2.8 million to be applied to the total construction costs of the new leased premises. The construction allowance must be used on or before December 31, 2017, or it will be deemed forfeited with no further obligation by the landlord of the new leased premises.\nPurchase commitments represent non-cancelable contractual commitments associated with certain clinical trial activities with our CROs.\nManufacturing commitments generally provide for termination on notice, and therefore are cancelable contracts but are contracts that we are likely to continue, regardless of the fact that they are cancelable.\nWe enter into contracts in the normal course of business to assist in the performance of our research and development activities and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice, and therefore are cancelable contracts and not included in the table of contractual obligations and commitments.\nIn April 2014, we entered into a credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank and MidCap Financial SBIC, LP, pursuant to which we were able to borrow an aggregate principal amount of up to $20.0 million, of which we borrowed $15.0 million. We did not borrow the remaining $5.0 million, and this amount is no longer available to us. The credit facility carries a fixed annual interest rate of 8.25% on outstanding borrowings. In April 2014, we issued the lenders warrants to purchase 100,000 shares of our Series D-1 redeemable convertible preferred stock with an exercise price of $3.00 per share. Upon the closing of our IPO in July 2014, the preferred stock warrants became warrants to purchase an aggregate of 37,878 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $7.92 per share.\nIn December 2015, we amended the credit facility to increase the aggregate principal amount to $15.6 million to capitalize certain accrued interest. The amended facility provides for monthly, interest-only payments on outstanding borrowings through December 2016. Thereafter, we were required to pay thirty-six consecutive, equal monthly installments of principal and interest through December 1, 2019. In March 2017, we further amended the credit facility to increase the total commitment to $38.0 million including $18.0 million of borrowings drawn at closing, which was used primarily to pay-off outstanding balances as of the closing date, and options on two additional tranches of $10.0 million each contingent upon on the achievement by us of regulatory and commercial milestones. The interest-only payment period was extended through February 1, 2018 and can be further extended upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones. There are no financial covenants associated with the credit facility. There are negative covenants restricting our activities, including limitations on dispositions, mergers or acquisitions; encumbering our intellectual property; incurring indebtedness or liens; paying dividends; making investments; and engaging in certain other business transactions. The obligations under the credit facility are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of specified events of default, including a material adverse change in our business, operations or financial or other condition. The credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets except for our intellectual property, which is subject to a negative pledge.\nWe have in-licensed a significant portion of our intellectual property from Incept, an intellectual property holding company, under an amended and restated license agreement that we entered into with Incept in January 2012. We are obligated to pay Incept a royalty equal to a low single-digit percentage of net sales made by us or our affiliates of any products covered by the licensed technology. Any sublicensee of ours also will be obligated to pay Incept a royalty equal to a low single-digit percentage of net sales made by it and will be bound by the terms of the agreement to the same extent as we are. We are obligated to reimburse Incept for our share of the reasonable fees and costs incurred by Incept in connection with the prosecution of the patent applications licensed to us under the agreement. Our share of these fees and costs is equal to the total amount of such fees and costs divided by the total number of Incept's exclusive licensees of the patent application. We have not included in the table above any payments to Incept under this license agreement as the amount, timing and likelihood of such payments are not known.\nIn October 2016, we entered into Collaboration Agreement with Regeneron. If the Option is exercised, Regeneron will conduct further preclinical development and an initial clinical trial under a collaboration plan. We are obligated to reimburse Regeneron for certain development costs during the period through the completion of the initial clinical trial, subject to a cap of $25 million, which cap may be increased by up to $5 million under certain circumstances. We have not included in the table above any payments to Regeneron under this Collaboration Agreement as the timing of such payments are not known. Regeneron will be responsible for funding an initial preclinical tolerability study. We do not expect our funding requirements to be material over the next twelve months. If Regeneron elects to proceed with further development beyond the initial clinical trial, it will be solely responsible for conducting and funding further development and commercialization of product candidates.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, which are often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating financing transactions that are not required to be reflected on our balance sheets.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40). ASU 2014-15 requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a one year period subsequent to the date of issuance of its financial statements. An entity must provide certain disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company adopted ASU 2014-15 during the fourth quarter of 2016. Adoption did not require additional disclosures in the financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),\u201d or ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09 outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. This new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized. The new model requires revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive. ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Deferral of the Effective Date\u201d, which amends ASU 2014-09. As a result, the effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017.\nSubsequently, the FASB has issued the following standards related to ASU 2014-09: ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),\u201d or ASU 2016-08; ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,\u201d or ASU 2016-10; ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,\u201d or ASU 2016-12; and ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d or ASU 2016-20, which are intended to provide additional guidance and clarity to ASU 2014-09. The Company must adopt ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-12 and ASU 2016-20 along with ASU 2014-09, which we collectively refer to as the New Revenue Standards.\nThe New Revenue Standards may be applied using one of two retrospective application methods: (1) a full retrospective approach for all periods presented, or (2) a modified retrospective approach that presents a cumulative effect as of the adoption date and additional required disclosures. We expect to adopt the New Revenue Standards in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective approach and are in the process of completing its initial analysis identifying the revenue streams that will be impacted by the adoption of this new standard and the impact to its financial statements and footnote disclosures.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (ASC 842), or ASU 2016-02. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet. This is expected to increase both reported assets and liabilities. The new lease standard does not substantially change lessor accounting. For public companies, the standard will be effective for the first interim reporting period within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, although early adoption is permitted. Lessees and lessors will be required to apply the new standard at the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements in which they first apply the new guidance, using a modified retrospective transition method. The requirements of this standard include a significant increase in required disclosures. We are currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on our financial statements and footnote disclosures.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation, or ASU 2016-09. ASU 2016-09 identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this update will be effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on our financial statements and footnote disclosures.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (ASU 2016-15). ASU 2016-15 is intended to add or clarify guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows and to eliminate the diversity in practice related to such classifications. The guidance in ASU 2016-15 is required for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the potential impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-15 on our statement of cash flows.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) - Restricted Cash,\u201d ( ASU 2016-18\u201d). ASU 2016-18 requires a statement of cash flows to explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. We are currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on our financial statements and footnote disclosures.", "item_7_truncated": "Accrued Research and Development Expenses\nTable 366: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPersonnel related (including stock-based compensation)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,580 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,508 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,072 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProfessional fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,993 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,625 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,368 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFacility related and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,128 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal selling and marketing expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,701 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,852 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,849 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFrom our inception through December 31, 2016, we have generated limited amounts of revenue from the sales of our products.

The lease expires on July 31, 2027. No base rent will be due under the lease until August 1, 2017. The initial annual base rent is approximately $1.2 million and will increase annually beginning on February 1 of each year. We are obligated to pay all real estate taxes and costs related to the premises, including costs of operations, maintenance, repair, and replacement and management of the new leased premises. We posted a customary letter of credit in the amount of $1.5 million as a security deposit. We intend to relocate our corporate headquarters to the new leased premises beginning in 2017 and expect to relocate all of our operations to the new leased premises by 2018. The lease agreement allows for a construction allowance not to exceed approximately $2.8 million to be applied to the total construction costs of the new leased premises. The construction allowance must be used on or before December 31, 2017, or it will be deemed forfeited with no further obligation by the landlord of the new leased premises.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $1.8 million was due to a $1.0 million increase in personnel related costs and an increase of $0.8 million in professional fees, and an increase of $0.1 million in facility-related and other costs. Our personnel related costs increased primarily due to an increase in stock compensation expense of $0.9 million.

Pursuant to this guidance, we evaluate multiple-element arrangements to determine (1) the deliverables included in the arrangement and (2) whether the individual deliverables represent separate units of accounting or whether they must be accounted for as a combined unit of accounting. This evaluation involves subjective determinations and requires us to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting provided that the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and, if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control. In assessing whether an item has standalone value, we consider factors such as the research, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether the collaboration partner can use the other deliverables for their intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining elements, whether the value of the deliverable is dependent on the undelivered item and whether there are other vendors that can provide the undelivered elements.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense consists of interest expense on our debt. We borrowed $15.0 million in aggregate principal amount in April 2014. In December 2015, we amended our credit facility to increase the aggregate principal amount to $15.6 million, extend the interest-only payment period through December 2016, and extend the maturity date to December 1, 2019.\n \u00b7 expenses relating to regulatory activities, including filing fees paid to the FDA for our submissions for product approvals; \nSelling and marketing expenses were $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $2.8 million was primarily due to an increase of $1.1 million in personnel costs relating to additional hiring as we plan for the potential launch of DEXTENZA and additional stock-based compensation expense, an increase of $1.4 million in professional fees due to increased spending on consulting, trade shows and conferences and an increase of $0.4 million in facility-related and other costs.\n \u00b7 the progress, costs and outcome of the clinical trials of our extended-delivery drug delivery product candidates, in particular DEXTENZA and OTX-TP; \nWe generated $1.8 and $1.4 million of product revenue during the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, from sales of our ReSure Sealant product. The increase in revenue is related to an increase in the total number of units shipped in 2016.

Any sublicensee of ours also will be obligated to pay Incept a royalty equal to a low single-digit percentage of net sales made by it and will be bound by the terms of the agreement to the same extent as we are. We are obligated to reimburse Incept for our share of the reasonable fees and costs incurred by Incept in connection with the prosecution of the patent applications licensed to us under the agreement. Our share of these fees and costs is equal to the total amount of such fees and costs divided by the total number of Incept's exclusive licensees of the patent application.

In September 2015, we submitted to the FDA a New Drug Application, or NDA, for DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular pain. On July 25, 2016, we announced that we had received a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, from the FDA regarding our NDA for DEXTENZA. On January 23, 2017, we announced that we had resubmitted our NDA. On February 22, 2017, we announced that the FDA accepted for review our NDA resubmission. The FDA determined that our NDA resubmission is a complete response and designated the NDA resubmission as a class 2, or major, review with a target action date under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, of July 19, 2017.\n\nIn August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40). ASU 2014-15 requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a one year period subsequent to the date of issuance of its financial statements. An entity must provide certain disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company adopted ASU 2014-15 during the fourth quarter of 2016. Adoption did not require additional disclosures in the financial statements.\nWe allocate arrangement consideration that is fixed or determinable among the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price method. Then, we apply the applicable revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605 to each of the separate units of accounting in determining the appropriate period and pattern of recognition. We determine the selling price of a unit of accounting following the hierarchy of evidence prescribed by ASC 605-25. Accordingly, we determine the estimated selling price for units of accounting within each arrangement using vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price, if available; third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price, if VSOE is not available; or best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. We typically use BESP to estimate the selling price as we generally do not have VSOE or TPE of selling price for our units of accounting. Determining the BESP for a unit of accounting requires significant judgment. In developing the BESP for a unit of accounting, we consider applicable market conditions and relevant entity-specific factors, including factors that were contemplated in negotiating the agreement with our customer and estimated costs. We validate the BESP for units of accounting by evaluating whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the BESP will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between multiple units of accounting.\n \u00b7 the scope, progress, costs and outcome of preclinical development and clinical trials of our other product candidates; \nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n \u00b7 expenses associated with developing our pre-commercial manufacturing capabilities and manufacturing clinical study materials; \n\n \u00b7 costs relating to the supply and manufacturing of product inventory, prior to approval by the FDA or other regulatory agencies of our products; \nRevenue\nSelling and marketing expenses were $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $1.9 million was primarily due to an increase of $0.7 million in personnel costs relating to additional hiring and additional stock-based compensation expense, an increase of $0.8 million in professional fees including consulting, trade shows and conferences and an increase of $0.4 million in facility-related and other costs.\nOperating Expenses\n \u00b7 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; \n \u00b7 expenses incurred in connection with the clinical trials of our product candidates, including with the investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials and under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs; \nIn October 2016, we entered into a strategic collaboration, option and license agreement, or Collaboration Agreement, with Regeneron for the development and potential commercialization of products containing our extended-delivery hydrogel depot in combination with Regeneron's large molecule VEGF-targeting compounds for the treatment of retinal diseases, with the initial focus on the VEGF trap aflibercept, currently marketed under the brand name Eylea. The Collaboration Agreement does not cover the development of any products that deliver small molecule drugs, including TKIs, for any target including VEGF, or any products that deliver large molecule drugs other than those that target VEGF proteins. We granted Regeneron an option, or the Option, to enter into an exclusive, worldwide license under our intellectual property to develop and commercialize products containing our extended-delivery hydrogel depot in combination with Regeneron's large molecule VEGF-targeting compounds, or Licensed Products.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation, or ASU 2016-09. ASU 2016-09 identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this update will be effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on our financial statements and footnote disclosures.\nOur second product candidate, OTX-TP, incorporates travoprost, an FDA-approved prostaglandin analog that reduces elevated intraocular pressure, or IOP, as its active pharmaceutical ingredient, into a hydrogel-based drug-eluting intracanalicular insert. OTX-TP is being developed as a treatment for glaucoma and ocular hypertension. We reported topline results from a Phase 2b clinical trial for this indication in October 2015. We completed an End-of-Phase 2 review with the FDA in April 2016 and initiated the first of two Phase 3 clinical trials of OTX-TP in September 2016.\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:\n \u00b7 continue to operate as a public company. \n \u00b7 royalty and patent legal fees payable made under our licensing agreement with Incept, LLC, or Incept. \nWe expect that our expenses will increase in connection with our ongoing activities. We estimate that in 2017, we will incur approximately $33.0 million to $35.0 million of research and development expenses, including costs related to clinical trials and other research and development activities. Of this amount, we estimate we will incur approximately $17.0 million to $19.0 million of external research and development expenses related to clinical trial and regulatory costs for our DEXTENZA and OTX-TP product candidates and approximately $15.0 million to $16.0 million of other research and development activities that we do not expect to track by program. We expect that our total costs to renovate our new facility, including research and development laboratories, manufacturing space and office space will be approximately $3.6 million, net of a landlord provided construction allowance of up to $2.8 million. In addition, we expect to purchase $2.0 million to $2.5 million in manufacturing and research and development capital equipment for our new facility.\nStock-Based Compensation\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),\u201d or ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09 outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. This new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized. The new model requires revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive. ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Deferral of the Effective Date\u201d, which amends ASU 2014-09. As a result, the effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017.\nUnder the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Regeneron has agreed to pay us $10 million upon exercise of the Option. We are also eligible to receive up to $145 million per Licensed Product upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones, including successful results from the first-in-human clinical trial, $100 million per Licensed Product upon first commercial sale of such Licensed Product and up to $50 million based on the achievement of specified sales milestones for all Licensed Products. In addition, we are entitled to tiered, escalating royalties, in a range from a high-single digit to a low-to-mid teen percentage of net sales of Licensed Products.\nOther expense, net was $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIn September 2013, we entered into a feasibility agreement with a biopharmaceutical company relating to our intravitreal drug delivery depot. Under this agreement, the biopharmaceutical company agreed to pay us up to $0.5 million under this feasibility study. In the event that the agreement was terminated in advance of the achievement of certain milestones, we would have been required to refund certain portions of the funding based on the actual work completed or milestones achieved as of the date of termination. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company completed the task related to the first milestone at which time the $0.3 million became non-refundable. The biopharmaceutical company has indicated that they will not proceed with the second phase of the agreement. The Company does not have any further obligations in connection with this agreement.\nWe have completed three Phase 3 clinical trials of DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain. The data from these three completed Phase 3 clinical trials and a prior Phase 2 clinical trial are being used to support our NDA for post-surgical ocular pain. Subject to receiving approval for the pain indication pursuant to our NDA, we plan to submit an NDA supplement, or sNDA, for DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation. We have also completed two Phase 3 clinical trials of DEXTENZA for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. In October 2015, we announced topline results of our first Phase 3 clinical trial for allergic conjunctivitis, and in June 2016 we announced topline results of our second Phase 3 clinical trial for this indication. Finally, DEXTENZA is in Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of dry eye disease. We announced topline results from an exploratory Phase 2 clinical trial for this indication in December 2015. We are assessing our plans for our dry eye program going forward and may focus future efforts on an intracanalicular insert containing an immunosuppressant drug.\nPurchase commitments represent non-cancelable contractual commitments associated with certain clinical trial activities with our CROs.\nThe successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the uncertainty of:\nResearch and development expenses were $26.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $7.7 million was primarily due to an increase of $4.6 million in clinical trial and regulatory expenses and an increase of $3.1 million in unallocated expenses. Clinical trial and regulatory expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the timing of clinical trials being conducted for DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis and dry eye disease.\nOur total cost and operating expenses were $45.2 million, $39.9 million and $27.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, including $6.0 million, $4.6 million and $5.0 million, respectively, in non-cash stock-based compensation expense and licensing and consulting fees paid in stock. We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase substantially as we pursue the clinical development of our most advanced product candidates, DEXTENZA and OTX-TP, continue the research and development of our other product candidates, continue the internal development of our intravitreal hydrogel depot for the sustained delivery of protein-based or small molecule anti-angiogenic drugs, such as anti-VEGF drugs for the treatment of wet AMD and other back-of-the-eye diseases and seek marketing approval for any such product candidate for which we obtain favorable pivotal clinical trial results. We expect to continue to incur substantial additional expenses for product manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution for our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for diseases and conditions of the eye using our proprietary hydrogel platform technology. Our bioresorbable hydrogel-based drug product candidates are designed to provide extended delivery of therapeutic agents to the eye. Our lead product candidates are DEXTENZA (dexamethasone insert), for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain, allergic conjunctivitis and dry eye disease, and OTX-TP for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension, which are extended-delivery, drug-eluting inserts that are placed into the canaliculus through a natural opening called the punctum located in the inner portion of the eyelid near the nose. Our intracanalicular inserts combine our hydrogel technology with U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved therapeutic agents with the goal of providing extended delivery of drug to the eye. We also have an intravitreal hydrogel depot which is in preclinical development for the treatment of diseases and conditions of the back of the eye including wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD. Our initial development efforts are focused on the use of our hydrogel depot in combination with anti-angiogenic drugs, such as protein-based anti-VEGF drugs or small molecule drugs, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or TKIs. Our intravitreal depot is designed to be delivered via injection to release therapeutic agents, such as antibodies to vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, over an extended period. We have entered into a collaboration, option and license with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Regeneron, for the development and potential commercialization of products containing our extended-delivery hydrogel depot in combination with Regeneron's large molecule VEGF-targeting compounds, with the initial focus on the VEGF trap aflibercept, currently marketed under the brand name Eylea. In addition to our ongoing product development, we currently market our first commercial product, ReSure Sealant, a hydrogel-based ophthalmic wound sealant approved by the FDA to seal corneal incisions following cataract surgery. ReSure Sealant is the first and only surgical sealant to be approved by the FDA for ophthalmic use.\n \u00b7 not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; \n \u00b7 continue to pursue the clinical development of our most advanced intracanalicular insert product candidates, DEXTENZA and OTX-TP; \nIn addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to delay such adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report, we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nFinancing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2016 was $0.6 million and consisted primarily of proceeds of $0.6 million, net of underwriting discounts and other offering expenses, related to the 2016 ATM Agreement, proceeds from the exercise of common stock options of $0.2 million; and proceeds from issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan of $0.3 million partially offset by payments of $0.5 million for insurance costs financed by a third party. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2015 was $65.7 million and consisted primarily of proceeds of $65.6 million, net of underwriting discounts and other offering expenses, related to our follow-on offering, $1.5 million (net) in borrowings under our amended 2014 credit facility, proceeds from the exercise of common stock options of $0.2 million; and proceeds from issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan of $0.2 million partially offset by repayment of $1.5 million of outstanding principal under our 2014 credit facility, payments of $0.8 million for insurance costs financed by a third party. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2014 was $79.0 million and consisted primarily of proceeds of $69.5 million, net of underwriters discount related to our IPO, and $14.9 million from our new credit facility, under which we borrowed $15.0 million in aggregate principal amount in April 2014, partially offset by the payment of issuance costs of $3.0 million in connection with our IPO and the repayment of $2.3 million of outstanding principal and other amounts due in connection with our termination of a prior credit facility and repayments of principal prior to our termination of the credit facility.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOther expense, net was $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe assumptions we used to determine the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors are as follows, presented on a weighted average basis:\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $68.1 million. Cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy, primarily with a view to liquidity and capital preservation.\nWe measure all stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees and directors at the fair value on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We recognize the fair value of the awards as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We apply the straight-line method of expense recognition to all awards with service-only conditions.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nWe have generated limited revenue to date. In the first quarter of 2014, we began recognizing revenue from sales of ReSure Sealant. All of our sustained drug delivery products are in various phases of clinical and preclinical development. We do not expect sales of ReSure Sealant to generate revenue that is sufficient for us to achieve profitability. Instead, our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on our obtaining marketing approval for and commercializing products with greater market potential, including one or both of DEXTENZA and OTX-TP.\n \u00b7 significant and changing government regulation; and \nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (ASC 842), or ASU 2016-02. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet. This is expected to increase both reported assets and liabilities. The new lease standard does not substantially change lessor accounting. For public companies, the standard will be effective for the first interim reporting period within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, although early adoption is permitted. Lessees and lessors will be required to apply the new standard at the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements in which they first apply the new guidance, using a modified retrospective transition method. The requirements of this standard include a significant increase in required disclosures. We are currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on our financial statements and footnote disclosures.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $7.6 million in direct research and development expenses for our intracanalicular insert product candidates, including $2.7 million for our DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain which was in Phase 3 clinical trials, $2.8 million for our DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis which was in Phase 3 clinical trials, $0.1 million for our DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of dry eye disease which was in Phase 2 clinical trials, and $2.0 million for our OTX-TP product candidate for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension which was in Phase 3 clinical trials. In comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $10.3 million in direct research and development expenses for our intracanalicular insert product candidates, including $2.0 million for clinical trials of OTX-TP for glaucoma and ocular hypertension which was in Phase 2b clinical trials, $5.5 million for our DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis which was in Phase 3 clinical trials and $2.1 million for our DEXTENZA for ocular inflammation and pain following cataract surgery which was in Phase 3 clinical trials and $0.7 million for our DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of dry eye disease which was in Phase 2 clinical trials. Unallocated research and development costs increased $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in unallocated personnel costs of $2.3 million, relating to additional hiring primarily in our clinical, regulatory and quality department and an increase in stock-based compensation expense and the write off of $1.3 million of equipment that was in construction in process that is included in all other costs.\nIn addition to DEXTENZA and OTX-TP, we are engaged in the preclinical development of our hydrogel depot administered via intravitreal injection to address the large and growing markets for diseases and conditions of the back of the eye. Our initial development efforts are focused on the use of our extended-delivery hydrogel depot in combination with anti-angiogenic drugs, such as protein-based anti-VEGF drugs or small molecule drugs, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or TKIs, for the treatment of retinal diseases such as wet AMD, retinal vein occlusion and diabetic macular edema. Our initial goal for these programs is to provide extended delivery of a protein-based large molecule or small molecule TKI drug targeting VEGF and other targets over a four to six month period following administration of a bioresorbable hydrogel incorporating the drug by an injection into the vitreous humor, thereby reducing the frequency of the current monthly or bi-monthly intravitreal injection regimen for wet AMD and other retinal diseases and potentially providing a more consistent uniform release of drug over the treatment period.\nInventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, determined by the first-in, first-out method. Prior to initial approval by the FDA or other regulatory agencies of our products, we expense costs relating to the production of inventory in the period incurred as research and development expenses. After such time as the product receives approval, we begin to capitalize the inventory costs related to the product.\n \u00b7 employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development, clinical and regulatory and other related functions; \n \u00b7 the progress and status of our collaboration with Regeneron, including any development costs for which we reimburse Regeneron, the potential exercise by Regeneron of its option for a license for the development and potential commercialization of products containing our extended-delivery hydrogel depot in combination with Regeneron's large molecule VEGF-targeting compounds, and our potential receipt of future milestone payments from Regeneron; \nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \u00b7 vendors in connection with preclinical development activities; \nOperating activities. Net cash used in operating activities was $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily resulting from our net loss of $44.7 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $7.2 million and cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $2.1 million. Our net loss was primarily attributed to research and development activities and our general and administrative expenses partially offset by $1.9 million of revenue in the period. Our net non-cash charges during the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily consisted of $6.0 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.9 million of depreciation expense. Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted primarily of a $1.4 million increase in accrued expenses and deferred rent, a $0.9 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a $0.2 million increase in accounts payable, which was due to the timing of vendor invoicing and payments.\nThese assumptions represented our best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different. We recognize compensation expense for only the portion of awards that are expected to vest. In developing a forfeiture rate estimate for pre-vesting forfeitures, we have considered our historical experience of actual forfeitures. If our future actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, our stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and should be read together with the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\n \u00b7 renovate our new facility, including research and development laboratories, manufacturing space and office space; \ngovernment or other third-party funding, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and marketing and distribution arrangements. We do not have any committed external source of funds other than amounts we may receive from Regeneron for potential option exercise, development, regulatory and sales milestones and royalties under our collaboration and amounts we may be able to draw under our amended credit facility upon the achievement of regulatory and commercial milestones. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. The covenants under our existing credit facility, the pledge of our assets as collateral and the negative pledge of intellectual property limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing. If we raise additional funds through government or other third-party funding, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $33.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily resulting from our net loss of $39.7 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $5.6 million and cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $0.5 million. Our net loss was primarily attributed to research and development activities and our general and administrative expenses partially offset by $1.8 million of revenue in the period. Our net non-cash charges during the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily consisted of $4.6 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million of depreciation expense. Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of a $0.2 million increase in accrued expenses and deferred rent and a $0.3 million increase in accounts payable, which was due to the timing of vendor invoicing and payments, both partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $0.1 million.\nThe table below summarizes our research and development expenses incurred by product development program:\nWe base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple CROs that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed, enrollment of patients, number of sites activated and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, we have not made any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.\nResearch and development expenses were $27.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $26.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $0.4 million was primarily due to a decrease of $2.9 million in clinical trial and regulatory expenses and an increase of $3.3 million in unallocated expenses. Clinical trial and regulatory expenses decreased in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the timing and number of clinical trials being conducted for the DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis and dry eye disease.\n \u00b7 the costs of advancing our internal development efforts for the back-of-the-eye program through the remaining preclinical steps and potentially into an initial clinical trial; \nThrough December 31, 2016, we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our preferred stock, public offerings of our common stock and borrowings under credit facilities. In July 2014, we completed our IPO, and in August 2014 the underwriters in our IPO exercised their over-allotment option in full. We received total net proceeds of approximately $66.4 million from the issuance and sale of 5,750,000 shares of common stock, including in connection with the exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering costs. In June 2015, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock at a public offering price of $22.00 per share. The offering consisted of 4,600,000 shares of common stock, of which 3,200,000 shares were issued and sold by us and 1,400,000 shares were sold by certain stockholders, including those shares sold in connection with the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. We received net proceeds from the follow-on offering of approximately $65.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and offering expenses. In November 2016, we entered into the 2016 ATM Agreement with Cantor, under which we may offer and sell our common stock having aggregate proceeds of up to $40.0 million from time to time. To date, we have sold 263,418 shares of common stock under the 2016 ATM Agreement at a weighted average exercise price of $8.87 per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately $2.0 million after underwriting discounts, commission and other offering expenses. In January 2017, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock at a public offering price of $7.00 per share. The offering consisted of 3,571,429 shares of common stock sold by us. We received net proceeds from the follow-on offering of approximately $23.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts expenses.\nWe expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the clinical trials of our products in development and increase our sales and marketing resources focused on the potential launch of our product candidates including DEXTENZA, subject to receiving FDA approval.\nSince our inception in 2006, we have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in each year or our earned research and development tax credits, due to our uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items. As of December 31, 2016, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $85.2 million, which begin to expire in 2026, and state net operating loss carryforwards of $73.9 million, which begin to expire in 2029. As of December 31, 2016, we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of $4.1 million and state research and development tax credit carryforwards $2.1 million, which begin to expire in 2026 and 2025, respectively. We have not completed a study to assess whether an ownership change, generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in the equity ownership of our corporate entity over a three-year period, has occurred or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since our inception, due to the significant costs and complexities associated with such studies. Accordingly, our ability to utilize our tax carryforwards may be limited. Additionally, U.S. tax laws limit the time during which these carryforwards may be utilized against future taxes. As a result, we may not be able to take full advantage of these carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $10.3 million in direct research and development expenses for our intracanalicular insert product candidates, including $2.1 million for our DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain which was in Phase 3 clinical trials, $5.5 million for our DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis which was in Phase 3 clinical trials, $0.7 million for our DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of dry eye disease which was in Phase 2 clinical trials, and $2.0 million for our OTX-TP product candidate for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension which was in Phase 2b clinical trials. In comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred $6.0 million in direct research and development expenses for our intracanalicular insert product candidates, including $2.0 million for clinical trials of OTX-TP for glaucoma and ocular hypertension which was in Phase 2a clinical trials, $1.8 million for our DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis which was in Phase 2a clinical trials and $2.2 million for our DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain which was in Phase 3 clinical trials. Unallocated research and development costs decreased $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. In the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a one-time, non-cash expense of $1.7 million for a license fee paid in the form of stock which is included in the unallocated costs. In addition, unallocated personnel costs increased by $3.5 million, relating to additional hiring primarily in our clinical, regulatory and quality department and an increase in stock-based compensation expense.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include facility-related costs and professional fees for legal, patent, consulting and accounting and audit services.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nIn July 2014, we completed an initial public offering, or IPO, of our common stock, and in August 2014 the underwriters in our IPO exercised their over-allotment option in full. We received total net proceeds of approximately $66.4 million from the issuance and sale of 5,750,000 shares of common stock, including in connection with the exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering costs. In June 2015, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock at a public offering price of $22.00 per share. The offering consisted of 4,600,000 shares of common stock, of which 3,200,000 shares were issued and sold by us and 1,400,000 shares were sold by certain of our stockholders, including those shares sold in connection with the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. We received net proceeds from the follow-on offering of approximately $65.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. In November 2016, we entered into an At-the-Market Sales Agreement, or the 2016 ATM Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., or Cantor, under which we may offer and sell our common stock having aggregate proceeds of up to $40.0 million from time to time. As of February 28, 2017, we have sold 263,418 shares of common stock under the 2016 ATM Agreement at a weighted average exercise price of $8.87 per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately $2.0 million after underwriting discounts, commission and other offering expenses. In January 2017, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock at a public offering price of $7.00 per share. The offering consisted of 3,571,429 shares of common stock sold by us. We received net proceeds from the follow-on offering of approximately $23.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts expenses. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, will enable us to fund our operating expenses, debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2018. We will need to obtain additional capital to the support the planned commercial launch of DEXTENZA, subject to FDA approval. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nIn the table above, we set forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations and future commitments at December 31, 2016, as well as obligations related to contracts that we are likely to continue, regardless of the fact that they may be cancelable at December 31, 2016. Some of the figures that we include in this table are based on management's estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, and other factors. Because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (ASU 2016-15). ASU 2016-15 is intended to add or clarify guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows and to eliminate the diversity in practice related to such classifications. The guidance in ASU 2016-15 is required for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the potential impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-15 on our statement of cash flows.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $2.3 million was due to a $0.8 million increase in personnel related costs and an increase of $1.6 million in professional fees, partially offset by a decrease of $0.1 million in facility-related and other costs. Our personnel related costs increased due primarily to hiring in our general and administrative function. Professional fees increased primarily due to increased activities to support our operating as a public company for a full year.\nIn December 2015, we amended the credit facility to increase the aggregate principal amount to $15.6 million to capitalize certain accrued interest. The amended facility provides for monthly, interest-only payments on outstanding borrowings through December 2016. Thereafter, we were required to pay thirty-six consecutive, equal monthly installments of principal and interest through December 1, 2019. In March 2017, we further amended the credit facility to increase the total commitment to $38.0 million including $18.0 million of borrowings drawn at closing, which was used primarily to pay-off outstanding balances as of the closing date, and options on two additional tranches of $10.0 million each contingent upon on the achievement by us of regulatory and commercial milestones. The interest-only payment period was extended through February 1, 2018 and can be further extended upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones. There are no financial covenants associated with the credit facility. There are negative covenants restricting our activities, including limitations on dispositions, mergers or acquisitions; encumbering our intellectual property; incurring indebtedness or liens; paying dividends; making investments; and engaging in certain other business transactions. The obligations under the credit facility are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of specified events of default, including a material adverse change in our business, operations or financial or other condition. The credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets except for our intellectual property, which is subject to a negative pledge.\nJOBS Act\nWe entered into a feasibility agreement with a biotechnology company relating to our intravitreal drug delivery depot in October 2014. Under this agreement, the biotechnology company had agreed to pay us up to $0.7 million, of which $0.3 million was a non-refundable up-front payment due upon contract execution and $0.4 million will be due upon the achievement of certain milestones. Initially, we were recognizing the non-refundable, non-contingent up-front payment of $0.3 million as revenue on a straight-line basis over the twelve-month period in which we are expected to complete our performance obligations. Estimates of this development period involves the evaluation of many assumptions and uncertainties and may change if facts and circumstances change. During 2015, management reevaluated and revised the estimated development period to extend through March 2016. If and when a contingent milestone payment is earned, the additional consideration to be received will be added to the total expected payments under the contract and recognized as revenue based on the proportional performance methodology. In January 2015, we achieved the first milestone under the feasibility agreement triggering a payment due of $0.3 million. This agreement was terminated in the second quarter of 2016 and the Company does not have any further obligations. Through December 31, 2016, the Company had recognized revenue of $0.5 million related to this agreement.\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, accrued research and development expenses and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n2016, and extend the maturity date to December 1, 2019. The outstanding borrowings under this facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to 8.25%. In March 2017, we amended the credit facility to increase the total commitment to $38.0 million including $18.0 million of borrowings drawn at closing, which was used primarily to pay-off outstanding balances as of the closing date, and options on two additional tranches of $10.0 million each contingent on the achievement of regulatory and commercial milestones for DEXTENZA. The interest-only payment period was extended through February 1, 2018 and there are provisions to further extend the interest-only period based on the achievement of certain milestones. See -Contractual Obligations and Commitments\u201d for additional information.\nIn April 2014, we entered into a credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank and MidCap Financial SBIC, LP, pursuant to which we were able to borrow an aggregate principal amount of up to $20.0 million, of which we borrowed $15.0 million. We did not borrow the remaining $5.0 million, and this amount is no longer available to us. The credit facility carries a fixed annual interest rate of 8.25% on outstanding borrowings. In April 2014, we issued the lenders warrants to purchase 100,000 shares of our Series D-1 redeemable convertible preferred stock with an exercise price of $3.00 per share. Upon the closing of our IPO in July 2014, the preferred stock warrants became warrants to purchase an aggregate of 37,878 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $7.92 per share.\nInterest Income. Interest income consists primarily of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. In each of 2016, 2015, and 2014, our interest income has not been significant due to the low rates of interest being earned on our invested balances.\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\n \u00b7 approximately $2.0 million to $2.8 million for DEXTENZA for post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain; \n \u00b7 the extent to which we acquire or invest in other businesses, products and technologies. \n \u00b7 the level of product sales from any additional product for which we obtain marketing approval in the future; \nCash Flows\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our vendors and our clinical investigative sites.\nThe New Revenue Standards may be applied using one of two retrospective application methods: (1) a full retrospective approach for all periods presented, or (2) a modified retrospective approach that presents a cumulative effect as of the adoption date and additional required disclosures. We expect to adopt the New Revenue Standards in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective approach and are in the process of completing its initial analysis identifying the revenue streams that will be impacted by the adoption of this new standard and the impact to its financial statements and footnote disclosures.\n \u00b7 scale up our manufacturing processes and capabilities to support sales of commercial products, our ongoing clinical trials of our product candidates and commercialization of any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval, and expand our facilities to accommodate this scale up and the expected growth in personnel; \nSubsequently, the FASB has issued the following standards related to ASU 2014-09: ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),\u201d or ASU 2016-08; ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,\u201d or ASU 2016-10; ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,\u201d or ASU 2016-12; and ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d or ASU 2016-20, which are intended to provide additional guidance and clarity to ASU 2014-09. The Company must adopt ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-12 and ASU 2016-20 along with ASU 2014-09, which we collectively refer to as the New Revenue Standards.\nAt the inception of an arrangement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether: (1) the consideration is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone, (2) the consideration relates solely to past performance, and (3) the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone and the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether a milestone satisfies all of the criteria required to conclude that a milestone is substantive. Accordingly, pursuant to the guidance of ASC Topic 605-28, Revenue Recognition-Milestone Method, or ASC 605-28, revenue from milestone payments will be recognized in its entirety upon successful accomplishment of the milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\n\n \u00b7 seek to identify and develop additional product candidates, including through preclinical development activities associated with our back-of-the-eye program; \nFunding Requirements\n \u00b7 the costs of manufacturing, sales, marketing, distribution and other commercialization efforts with respect to any additional products for which we obtain marketing approval in the future; \n \u00b7 approximately $12.0 million to $15.0 million for OTX-TP for glaucoma and ocular hypertension; and \n\nInventory Valuation\n\n\nRegeneron Collaboration\nSelling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel in selling and marketing functions as well as consulting and advertising and promotion costs. Through December 31, 2014, we incurred selling and marketing expenses in connection with our first-generation surgical sealant product. In addition, we invested in sales and marketing resources in anticipation of an earlier approval of our surgical sealant product in the United States than we ultimately received from the FDA, as a result of a change in designation from a 510(k) to a PMA regulatory path. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we incurred selling and marketing expense in connection with ReSure Sealant, which we began commercializing in the first quarter of 2014.\nFor stock-based awards granted to consultants and nonemployees, we recognize compensation expense over the period during which services are rendered by such consultants and nonemployees until completed. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to completion of the service, we remeasure the fair value of these awards using the then-current fair value of our common stock and updated assumption inputs in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\n \u00b7 the amounts we receive, if any, from Regeneron for option exercise, development, regulatory and sales milestones and royalty payments under our collaboration; \nBack-of-the-Eye Programs\n \u00b7 expand our operational, financial and management systems and personnel, including personnel to support our clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts and our operations as a public company; \nAny changes in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates in clinical and preclinical development could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of these product candidates. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials or other testing beyond those that we currently expect or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development of that product candidate.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $44.7 million, $39.7 million and $28.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $173.9 million.\nSelling and Marketing Expenses\nWe generated $1.4 and $0.5 million of product revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, from sales of our ReSure Sealant product, for which we received FDA approval in January 2014. We generated $0.4 million and $0.3 million of revenue from our collaboration agreements in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nIn October 2016, we entered into Collaboration Agreement with Regeneron. If the Option is exercised, Regeneron will conduct further preclinical development and an initial clinical trial under a collaboration plan. We are obligated to reimburse Regeneron for certain development costs during the period through the completion of the initial clinical trial, subject to a cap of $25 million, which cap may be increased by up to $5 million under certain circumstances. We have not included in the table above any payments to Regeneron under this Collaboration Agreement as the timing of such payments are not known. Regeneron will be responsible for funding an initial preclinical tolerability study. We do not expect our funding requirements to be material over the next twelve months. If Regeneron elects to proceed with further development beyond the initial clinical trial, it will be solely responsible for conducting and funding further development and commercialization of product candidates.\n \u00b7 approximately $1.0 million to $1.2 million for DEXTENZA for allergic conjunctivitis; \n \u00b7 increase our product liability and clinical trial insurance coverage as we expand our clinical trials and commercialization efforts; and \n \u00b7 the extent to which we choose to establish additional collaboration, distribution or other marketing arrangements for our products and product candidates; \nOur direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to investigators, consultants, central laboratories and CROs in connection with our clinical trials and regulatory fees. We do not allocate employee and contractor-related costs, costs associated with our platform technology, costs related to manufacturing or purchasing clinical trial materials, and facility expenses, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific product development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product development programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We use internal resources in combination with third-party CROs, including clinical monitors and clinical research associates, to manage our clinical trials, monitor patient enrollment and perform data analysis for many of our clinical trials. These employees work across multiple development programs and, therefore, we do not track their costs by program.\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include:\nReSure\nWhenever we determine that an element is delivered over a period of time, revenue is recognized using either a proportional performance model or a straight-line model over the period of performance. At each reporting period, we reassess our cumulative measure of performance and make appropriate adjustments, if necessary. We recognize revenue using the proportional performance model whenever we can make reasonably reliable estimates of the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement. Revenue recognized under the proportional performance model at each reporting period is determined by multiplying the total expected payments under the contract (excluding payments contingent upon achievement of milestones) by the ratio of the level of effort incurred to date to the estimated total level of effort required to complete the performance obligations under the arrangement. Revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned, as determined using the proportional performance model as of each reporting period. Alternatively, if we cannot make reasonably reliable estimates the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement, then revenue under the arrangement is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period expected to complete our performance obligations. If and when a contingent milestone payment is earned, the additional consideration to be received is added to the total expected payments under the contract. Revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned, as determined on a straight-line basis as of the period end date. If we cannot reasonably estimate when our performance obligation period ends, then revenue is deferred until we can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation period ends.\n\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2016 and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods:\nWe recognize revenue when the following four criteria are met in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 605, Revenue Recognition: persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; delivery of goods has occurred through transfer of title and risk and rewards of ownership; the selling price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.\nSelling and Marketing Expenses\n\nOther Income (Expense)\n \u00b7 the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims; and \nWe estimate the fair value of each stock option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Use of this model requires that we make assumptions as to the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. Prior to our IPO, we had been a private company and lacked company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, we estimate our expected volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded group of peer companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our publicly traded stock price. Beginning in 2016, we estimate our expected volatility using a weighted average of the historical volatility of our publicly traded peer companies and the volatility of our common stock, and expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our traded stock price. We use the simplified method prescribed by Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate the expected term of options granted to employees and directors. We base the expected term of options granted to consultants and nonemployees on the contractual term of the options. We determine the risk-free interest rate by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued development and commercialization of our product candidates. We also anticipate to continue to incur increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance, director and officer insurance costs as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with being a public company.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\n \u00b7 continue the research and development of our other product candidates; \n \u00b7 expenses associated with preclinical development activities; and \nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advanced payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\n \u00b7 the costs of expanding our facilities to accommodate our manufacturing needs and expected growth in personnel; \nFollowing our receipt of FDA approval for ReSure Sealant, we commercially launched this product in the United States in 2014, initially through a network of ophthalmology-focused distributors. In early 2017, we terminated these distributors and hired a contract sales force of four representatives to sell ReSure Sealant. ReSure Sealant is approved to seal corneal incisions following cataract surgery and is the first and only surgical sealant to be approved by the FDA for ophthalmic use. In the pivotal clinical trials that formed the basis for FDA approval, ReSure Sealant provided superior wound closure and a better safety profile than sutured closure.\n \u00b7 the efficacy and potential advantages of our product candidates compared to alternative treatments, including any standard of care; \nOther Income (Expense), Net. In 2014, other income (expense), net consisted primarily of the gain or loss associated with the change in the fair value of our preferred stock warrant liability and small amounts of miscellaneous income and expense items unrelated to core operations. We issued warrants for the purchase of our redeemable convertible preferred stock that we believed were financial instruments that could require a transfer of assets because of the redemption feature of the underlying stock. Therefore, we classified these warrants as liabilities and they were remeasured to fair value at each reporting period, and we recorded the changes in the fair value as a component of other income (expense), net. Upon the closing of our IPO in July 2014, the underlying redeemable convertible preferred stock was converted into common stock, the preferred stock warrants became exercisable for common stock instead of preferred stock, and the fair value of the warrant liability became fixed as of that date and was reclassified to additional paid-in capital. In 2015 and 2016, other income (expense), net consists of small amounts of miscellaneous income and expense items unrelated to our core operations.\nOther contingent, event-based payments received for which payment is either contingent solely upon the passage of time or the results of a collaborative partner's performance would not be considered milestones under ASC 605-28. In accordance with ASC 605-25, such payments will be recognized as revenue when all of the four basic revenue recognition criteria are met.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate product revenues sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of revenue from sales of ReSure Sealant, equity offerings, debt financings,\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\nNet cash used in operating activities was $20.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily resulting from our net loss of $28.6 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $6.0 million and cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $2.2 million. Our net loss was primarily attributed to research and development activities and our general and administrative expenses partially offset by $0.8 million of revenue in the period. Our net non-cash charges during the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily consisted of $2.4 million of licensing and consultant fees paid in common stock, $2.6 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.5 million of depreciation expense. Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted primarily of a $1.9 million increase in accrued expenses and deferred rent and a $0.5 million increase in accounts payable, which was due to the timing of vendor invoicing and payments, both partially offset by an increase in inventory of $0.1 million.\nWe estimate that we will incur external research and development expenses for 2017, as follows:\nWe have generated limited revenue to date. In the first quarter of 2014, we began recognizing revenue from sales of ReSure Sealant. All of our sustained drug delivery products are in various phases of clinical and preclinical development. We do not expect sales of ReSure Sealant to generate revenue that is sufficient for us to achieve profitability. Instead, our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on our obtaining marketing approval for and commercializing products with greater market potential, including one or both of DEXTENZA and OTX-TP. Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $44.7 million, $39.7 million and $28.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $173.9 million.\nBased on our current plans and forecasted expenses, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will enable us to fund our operating expenses, debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2018. We will need to obtain additional capital to support the planned commercial launch of DEXTENZA, subject to FDA approval. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect.\n\n\nWe anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:\nRevenue Recognition\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) - Restricted Cash,\u201d ( ASU 2016-18\u201d). ASU 2016-18 requires a statement of cash flows to explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. We are currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on our financial statements and footnote disclosures.\nFinancial Operations Overview\n \u00b7 the scope, progress, outcome and costs of our clinical trials and other research and development activities; \nSubsequent to the approval of ReSure Sealant in January 2014, we started to capitalize inventory of this product. We review our inventories for potential obsolescence.\nRevenue\n \u00b7 not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements; \nResearch and Development Expenses\nManufacturing commitments generally provide for termination on notice, and therefore are cancelable contracts but are contracts that we are likely to continue, regardless of the fact that they are cancelable.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $68.1 million. In April 2014, we borrowed $15.0 million in aggregate principal amount under a new credit facility and used $1.9 million of this amount to repay $1.7 million aggregate principal amount of indebtedness and pay $0.2 million of other amounts due in connection with our termination of a prior credit facility. In December 2015, we amended our credit facility to increase the aggregate principal amount to $15.6 million, extend the interest-only payment period through December\n \u00b7 investigative sites or other providers in connection with clinical trials; ", "item_7_text": "Accrued Research and Development Expenses\nFrom our inception through December 31, 2016, we have generated limited amounts of revenue from the sales of our products. Our ReSure Sealant product received premarket approval, or PMA, from the FDA in January 2014. We commenced sales of ReSure Sealant in the first quarter of 2014, have received only limited revenues from ReSure Sealant to date and anticipate only limited sales for 2017. ReSure Sealant is currently our only source of revenue from product sales. We may generate revenue in the future if we successfully develop one or more of our product candidates and receive marketing approval for any such product candidate or if we enter into longer-term collaboration agreements with third parties.\n \u00b7 ongoing research and development activities relating to our core bioresorbable hydrogel technology and improvements to this technology; \n \u00b7 conduct joint research and development under our strategic collaboration with Regeneron for the development and potential commercialization of products containing our extended-delivery hydrogel depot in combination with Regeneron's large molecule VEGF-targeting compounds to treat retinal diseases; \nWe expect to continue to take advantage of some or all of the available exemptions.\nOn June 17, 2016, we entered into a lease agreement for approximately 70,712 square feet of general office, research and development and manufacturing space. The lease expires on July 31, 2027. No base rent will be due under the lease until August 1, 2017. The initial annual base rent is approximately $1.2 million and will increase annually beginning on February 1 of each year. We are obligated to pay all real estate taxes and costs related to the premises, including costs of operations, maintenance, repair, and replacement and management of the new leased premises. We posted a customary letter of credit in the amount of $1.5 million as a security deposit. We intend to relocate our corporate headquarters to the new leased premises beginning in 2017 and expect to relocate all of our operations to the new leased premises by 2018. The lease agreement allows for a construction allowance not to exceed approximately $2.8 million to be applied to the total construction costs of the new leased premises. The construction allowance must be used on or before December 31, 2017, or it will be deemed forfeited with no further obligation by the landlord of the new leased premises.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $1.8 million was due to a $1.0 million increase in personnel related costs and an increase of $0.8 million in professional fees, and an increase of $0.1 million in facility-related and other costs. Our personnel related costs increased primarily due to an increase in stock compensation expense of $0.9 million. Professional fees increased primarily due to activities to support our operating as a public company.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe expect selling and marketing expenses to increase in preparation for the potential approval of our resubmitted NDA by the FDA and commercial launch of our DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of post-surgical ocular pain. We expect such expenses to further increase in preparation for the potential label expansion to include post-surgical ocular inflammation, subject to submission and approval of an NDA supplement.\nWe record revenue from product sales net of applicable provisions for returns, chargebacks, discounts, wholesaler management fees, government and commercial rebates, and other applicable allowances in the same period in which the related sales are recorded, based on the underlying contract terms.\n \u00b7 the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates by the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities, including our current NDA for DEXTENZA; \n \u00b7 facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and supplies; \nIf the Option is exercised, Regeneron will conduct further preclinical development and an initial clinical trial under a collaboration plan. We are obligated to reimburse Regeneron for certain development costs during the period through the completion of the initial clinical trial, subject to a cap of $25 million, which cap may be increased by up to $5 million under certain circumstances. Regeneron will be responsible for funding an initial preclinical tolerability study. We do not expect our funding requirements to be material over the next twelve months. If Regeneron elects to proceed with further development beyond the initial clinical trial, it will be solely responsible for conducting and funding further development and commercialization of product candidates.\nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and may remain an emerging growth company for up to five years. As an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include:\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, which are often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating financing transactions that are not required to be reflected on our balance sheets.\nWe do not expect to generate significant revenue from sales of any product for several years, if at all. Accordingly, we may need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to access our borrowing capacity or raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts or to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nOverview\nWe enter into contracts in the normal course of business to assist in the performance of our research and development activities and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice, and therefore are cancelable contracts and not included in the table of contractual obligations and commitments.\nWe recognize arrangement consideration allocated to each unit of accounting when all of the revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605 are satisfied for that particular unit of accounting. We will recognize as revenue arrangement consideration attributed to licenses that have standalone value relative to the other deliverables to be provided in an arrangement upon delivery. We will recognize as revenue arrangement consideration attributed to licenses that do not have standalone value relative to the other deliverables to be provided in an arrangement over our estimated performance period, as the arrangement would be accounted for as a single unit of accounting.\n \u00b7 vendors related to product manufacturing, development and distribution of clinical supplies. \nWe analyze multiple-element arrangements based on the guidance in ASC Topic 605-25, Revenue Recognition-Multiple-Element Arrangements, or ASC 605-25. Pursuant to this guidance, we evaluate multiple-element arrangements to determine (1) the deliverables included in the arrangement and (2) whether the individual deliverables represent separate units of accounting or whether they must be accounted for as a combined unit of accounting. This evaluation involves subjective determinations and requires us to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting provided that the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and, if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control. In assessing whether an item has standalone value, we consider factors such as the research, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether the collaboration partner can use the other deliverables for their intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining elements, whether the value of the deliverable is dependent on the undelivered item and whether there are other vendors that can provide the undelivered elements.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense consists of interest expense on our debt. We borrowed $15.0 million in aggregate principal amount in April 2014. In December 2015, we amended our credit facility to increase the aggregate principal amount to $15.6 million, extend the interest-only payment period through December 2016, and extend the maturity date to December 1, 2019.\n \u00b7 expenses relating to regulatory activities, including filing fees paid to the FDA for our submissions for product approvals; \nSelling and marketing expenses were $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $2.8 million was primarily due to an increase of $1.1 million in personnel costs relating to additional hiring as we plan for the potential launch of DEXTENZA and additional stock-based compensation expense, an increase of $1.4 million in professional fees due to increased spending on consulting, trade shows and conferences and an increase of $0.4 million in facility-related and other costs.\n \u00b7 the progress, costs and outcome of the clinical trials of our extended-delivery drug delivery product candidates, in particular DEXTENZA and OTX-TP; \nWe generated $1.8 and $1.4 million of product revenue during the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, from sales of our ReSure Sealant product. The increase in revenue is related to an increase in the total number of units shipped in 2016. We generated $42,000 and $0.4 million of revenue from our collaboration agreements in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n \u00b7 the timing, receipt and terms of any marketing approvals. \nContractual Obligations and Commitments\n \u00b7 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and \nWe have in-licensed a significant portion of our intellectual property from Incept, an intellectual property holding company, under an amended and restated license agreement that we entered into with Incept in January 2012. We are obligated to pay Incept a royalty equal to a low single-digit percentage of net sales made by us or our affiliates of any products covered by the licensed technology. Any sublicensee of ours also will be obligated to pay Incept a royalty equal to a low single-digit percentage of net sales made by it and will be bound by the terms of the agreement to the same extent as we are. We are obligated to reimburse Incept for our share of the reasonable fees and costs incurred by Incept in connection with the prosecution of the patent applications licensed to us under the agreement. Our share of these fees and costs is equal to the total amount of such fees and costs divided by the total number of Incept's exclusive licensees of the patent application. We have not included in the table above any payments to Incept under this license agreement as the amount, timing and likelihood of such payments are not known.\nFinancial Position\nResults of Operations\nOperating lease commitments represent payments due under our leases of office, laboratory and manufacturing space in Bedford, Massachusetts and certain office equipment under operating leases that expire in June 2017 and June 2018.\nInvesting activities. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of maturities of marketable securities of $80.7 million offset by cash used to purchase property and equipment of $1.9 million and cash used to purchase marketable securities of $41.7 million. Net cash used in investing activities for the\nDEXTENZA\n \u00b7 seek marketing approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical development; \nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\n \u00b7 the market acceptance of our product candidates; \nyear ended December 31, 2015 consisted of cash used to purchase property and equipment of $1.8 million and cash used to purchase marketable securities of $91.7 million offset by maturities of marketable securities of $54.8 million. Net cash used by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted of cash used to purchase property and equipment of $1.3 million and cash used to purchase marketable securities of $37.3 million. Purchases of property and equipment in 2014 consisted primarily of laboratory equipment, inclusive of building a clean room, which we commenced in 2013.\nOTX-TP\nSelling and Marketing Expenses\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\nRevenue\n \u00b7 CROs in connection with clinical trials; and \n \u00b7 exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. \n \u00b7 approximately $0.9 million to $1.2 million for other external research and development activities. \n \u00b7 develop and expand our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any of our product candidates, including DEXTENZA, for which we may obtain marketing approval; \nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nOur most advanced product candidate, DEXTENZA, incorporates the FDA-approved corticosteroid dexamethasone as an active pharmaceutical ingredient into a hydrogel-based drug-eluting insert for intracanalicular use. In September 2015, we submitted to the FDA a New Drug Application, or NDA, for DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular pain. On July 25, 2016, we announced that we had received a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, from the FDA regarding our NDA for DEXTENZA. On January 23, 2017, we announced that we had resubmitted our NDA. On February 22, 2017, we announced that the FDA accepted for review our NDA resubmission. The FDA determined that our NDA resubmission is a complete response and designated the NDA resubmission as a class 2, or major, review with a target action date under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, of July 19, 2017.\n\nIn August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40). ASU 2014-15 requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a one year period subsequent to the date of issuance of its financial statements. An entity must provide certain disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company adopted ASU 2014-15 during the fourth quarter of 2016. Adoption did not require additional disclosures in the financial statements.\nWe allocate arrangement consideration that is fixed or determinable among the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price method. Then, we apply the applicable revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605 to each of the separate units of accounting in determining the appropriate period and pattern of recognition. We determine the selling price of a unit of accounting following the hierarchy of evidence prescribed by ASC 605-25. Accordingly, we determine the estimated selling price for units of accounting within each arrangement using vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price, if available; third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price, if VSOE is not available; or best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. We typically use BESP to estimate the selling price as we generally do not have VSOE or TPE of selling price for our units of accounting. Determining the BESP for a unit of accounting requires significant judgment. In developing the BESP for a unit of accounting, we consider applicable market conditions and relevant entity-specific factors, including factors that were contemplated in negotiating the agreement with our customer and estimated costs. We validate the BESP for units of accounting by evaluating whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the BESP will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between multiple units of accounting.\n \u00b7 the scope, progress, costs and outcome of preclinical development and clinical trials of our other product candidates; \nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n \u00b7 expenses associated with developing our pre-commercial manufacturing capabilities and manufacturing clinical study materials; \n\n \u00b7 costs relating to the supply and manufacturing of product inventory, prior to approval by the FDA or other regulatory agencies of our products; \nRevenue\nSelling and marketing expenses were $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $1.9 million was primarily due to an increase of $0.7 million in personnel costs relating to additional hiring and additional stock-based compensation expense, an increase of $0.8 million in professional fees including consulting, trade shows and conferences and an increase of $0.4 million in facility-related and other costs.\nOperating Expenses\n \u00b7 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; \n \u00b7 expenses incurred in connection with the clinical trials of our product candidates, including with the investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials and under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs; \nIn October 2016, we entered into a strategic collaboration, option and license agreement, or Collaboration Agreement, with Regeneron for the development and potential commercialization of products containing our extended-delivery hydrogel depot in combination with Regeneron's large molecule VEGF-targeting compounds for the treatment of retinal diseases, with the initial focus on the VEGF trap aflibercept, currently marketed under the brand name Eylea. The Collaboration Agreement does not cover the development of any products that deliver small molecule drugs, including TKIs, for any target including VEGF, or any products that deliver large molecule drugs other than those that target VEGF proteins. We granted Regeneron an option, or the Option, to enter into an exclusive, worldwide license under our intellectual property to develop and commercialize products containing our extended-delivery hydrogel depot in combination with Regeneron's large molecule VEGF-targeting compounds, or Licensed Products.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation, or ASU 2016-09. ASU 2016-09 identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this update will be effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on our financial statements and footnote disclosures.\nOur second product candidate, OTX-TP, incorporates travoprost, an FDA-approved prostaglandin analog that reduces elevated intraocular pressure, or IOP, as its active pharmaceutical ingredient, into a hydrogel-based drug-eluting intracanalicular insert. OTX-TP is being developed as a treatment for glaucoma and ocular hypertension. We reported topline results from a Phase 2b clinical trial for this indication in October 2015. We completed an End-of-Phase 2 review with the FDA in April 2016 and initiated the first of two Phase 3 clinical trials of OTX-TP in September 2016.\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:\n \u00b7 continue to operate as a public company. \n \u00b7 royalty and patent legal fees payable made under our licensing agreement with Incept, LLC, or Incept. \nWe expect that our expenses will increase in connection with our ongoing activities. We estimate that in 2017, we will incur approximately $33.0 million to $35.0 million of research and development expenses, including costs related to clinical trials and other research and development activities. Of this amount, we estimate we will incur approximately $17.0 million to $19.0 million of external research and development expenses related to clinical trial and regulatory costs for our DEXTENZA and OTX-TP product candidates and approximately $15.0 million to $16.0 million of other research and development activities that we do not expect to track by program. We expect that our total costs to renovate our new facility, including research and development laboratories, manufacturing space and office space will be approximately $3.6 million, net of a landlord provided construction allowance of up to $2.8 million. In addition, we expect to purchase $2.0 million to $2.5 million in manufacturing and research and development capital equipment for our new facility.\nStock-Based Compensation\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),\u201d or ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09 outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. This new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized. The new model requires revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive. ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Deferral of the Effective Date\u201d, which amends ASU 2014-09. As a result, the effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017.\nUnder the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Regeneron has agreed to pay us $10 million upon exercise of the Option. We are also eligible to receive up to $145 million per Licensed Product upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones, including successful results from the first-in-human clinical trial, $100 million per Licensed Product upon first commercial sale of such Licensed Product and up to $50 million based on the achievement of specified sales milestones for all Licensed Products. In addition, we are entitled to tiered, escalating royalties, in a range from a high-single digit to a low-to-mid teen percentage of net sales of Licensed Products.\nOther expense, net was $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIn September 2013, we entered into a feasibility agreement with a biopharmaceutical company relating to our intravitreal drug delivery depot. Under this agreement, the biopharmaceutical company agreed to pay us up to $0.5 million under this feasibility study. In the event that the agreement was terminated in advance of the achievement of certain milestones, we would have been required to refund certain portions of the funding based on the actual work completed or milestones achieved as of the date of termination. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company completed the task related to the first milestone at which time the $0.3 million became non-refundable. The biopharmaceutical company has indicated that they will not proceed with the second phase of the agreement. The Company does not have any further obligations in connection with this agreement.\nWe have completed three Phase 3 clinical trials of DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain. The data from these three completed Phase 3 clinical trials and a prior Phase 2 clinical trial are being used to support our NDA for post-surgical ocular pain. Subject to receiving approval for the pain indication pursuant to our NDA, we plan to submit an NDA supplement, or sNDA, for DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation. We have also completed two Phase 3 clinical trials of DEXTENZA for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. In October 2015, we announced topline results of our first Phase 3 clinical trial for allergic conjunctivitis, and in June 2016 we announced topline results of our second Phase 3 clinical trial for this indication. Finally, DEXTENZA is in Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of dry eye disease. We announced topline results from an exploratory Phase 2 clinical trial for this indication in December 2015. We are assessing our plans for our dry eye program going forward and may focus future efforts on an intracanalicular insert containing an immunosuppressant drug.\nPurchase commitments represent non-cancelable contractual commitments associated with certain clinical trial activities with our CROs.\nThe successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the uncertainty of:\nResearch and development expenses were $26.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $7.7 million was primarily due to an increase of $4.6 million in clinical trial and regulatory expenses and an increase of $3.1 million in unallocated expenses. Clinical trial and regulatory expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the timing of clinical trials being conducted for DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis and dry eye disease.\nOur total cost and operating expenses were $45.2 million, $39.9 million and $27.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, including $6.0 million, $4.6 million and $5.0 million, respectively, in non-cash stock-based compensation expense and licensing and consulting fees paid in stock. We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase substantially as we pursue the clinical development of our most advanced product candidates, DEXTENZA and OTX-TP, continue the research and development of our other product candidates, continue the internal development of our intravitreal hydrogel depot for the sustained delivery of protein-based or small molecule anti-angiogenic drugs, such as anti-VEGF drugs for the treatment of wet AMD and other back-of-the-eye diseases and seek marketing approval for any such product candidate for which we obtain favorable pivotal clinical trial results. We expect to continue to incur substantial additional expenses for product manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution for our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for diseases and conditions of the eye using our proprietary hydrogel platform technology. Our bioresorbable hydrogel-based drug product candidates are designed to provide extended delivery of therapeutic agents to the eye. Our lead product candidates are DEXTENZA (dexamethasone insert), for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain, allergic conjunctivitis and dry eye disease, and OTX-TP for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension, which are extended-delivery, drug-eluting inserts that are placed into the canaliculus through a natural opening called the punctum located in the inner portion of the eyelid near the nose. Our intracanalicular inserts combine our hydrogel technology with U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved therapeutic agents with the goal of providing extended delivery of drug to the eye. We also have an intravitreal hydrogel depot which is in preclinical development for the treatment of diseases and conditions of the back of the eye including wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD. Our initial development efforts are focused on the use of our hydrogel depot in combination with anti-angiogenic drugs, such as protein-based anti-VEGF drugs or small molecule drugs, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or TKIs. Our intravitreal depot is designed to be delivered via injection to release therapeutic agents, such as antibodies to vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, over an extended period. We have entered into a collaboration, option and license with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Regeneron, for the development and potential commercialization of products containing our extended-delivery hydrogel depot in combination with Regeneron's large molecule VEGF-targeting compounds, with the initial focus on the VEGF trap aflibercept, currently marketed under the brand name Eylea. In addition to our ongoing product development, we currently market our first commercial product, ReSure Sealant, a hydrogel-based ophthalmic wound sealant approved by the FDA to seal corneal incisions following cataract surgery. ReSure Sealant is the first and only surgical sealant to be approved by the FDA for ophthalmic use.\n \u00b7 not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; \n \u00b7 continue to pursue the clinical development of our most advanced intracanalicular insert product candidates, DEXTENZA and OTX-TP; \nIn addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to delay such adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report, we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nFinancing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2016 was $0.6 million and consisted primarily of proceeds of $0.6 million, net of underwriting discounts and other offering expenses, related to the 2016 ATM Agreement, proceeds from the exercise of common stock options of $0.2 million; and proceeds from issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan of $0.3 million partially offset by payments of $0.5 million for insurance costs financed by a third party. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2015 was $65.7 million and consisted primarily of proceeds of $65.6 million, net of underwriting discounts and other offering expenses, related to our follow-on offering, $1.5 million (net) in borrowings under our amended 2014 credit facility, proceeds from the exercise of common stock options of $0.2 million; and proceeds from issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan of $0.2 million partially offset by repayment of $1.5 million of outstanding principal under our 2014 credit facility, payments of $0.8 million for insurance costs financed by a third party. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2014 was $79.0 million and consisted primarily of proceeds of $69.5 million, net of underwriters discount related to our IPO, and $14.9 million from our new credit facility, under which we borrowed $15.0 million in aggregate principal amount in April 2014, partially offset by the payment of issuance costs of $3.0 million in connection with our IPO and the repayment of $2.3 million of outstanding principal and other amounts due in connection with our termination of a prior credit facility and repayments of principal prior to our termination of the credit facility.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOther expense, net was $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe assumptions we used to determine the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors are as follows, presented on a weighted average basis:\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $68.1 million. Cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy, primarily with a view to liquidity and capital preservation.\nWe measure all stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees and directors at the fair value on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We recognize the fair value of the awards as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We apply the straight-line method of expense recognition to all awards with service-only conditions.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nWe have generated limited revenue to date. In the first quarter of 2014, we began recognizing revenue from sales of ReSure Sealant. All of our sustained drug delivery products are in various phases of clinical and preclinical development. We do not expect sales of ReSure Sealant to generate revenue that is sufficient for us to achieve profitability. Instead, our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on our obtaining marketing approval for and commercializing products with greater market potential, including one or both of DEXTENZA and OTX-TP.\n \u00b7 significant and changing government regulation; and \nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (ASC 842), or ASU 2016-02. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet. This is expected to increase both reported assets and liabilities. The new lease standard does not substantially change lessor accounting. For public companies, the standard will be effective for the first interim reporting period within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, although early adoption is permitted. Lessees and lessors will be required to apply the new standard at the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements in which they first apply the new guidance, using a modified retrospective transition method. The requirements of this standard include a significant increase in required disclosures. We are currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on our financial statements and footnote disclosures.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $7.6 million in direct research and development expenses for our intracanalicular insert product candidates, including $2.7 million for our DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain which was in Phase 3 clinical trials, $2.8 million for our DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis which was in Phase 3 clinical trials, $0.1 million for our DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of dry eye disease which was in Phase 2 clinical trials, and $2.0 million for our OTX-TP product candidate for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension which was in Phase 3 clinical trials. In comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $10.3 million in direct research and development expenses for our intracanalicular insert product candidates, including $2.0 million for clinical trials of OTX-TP for glaucoma and ocular hypertension which was in Phase 2b clinical trials, $5.5 million for our DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis which was in Phase 3 clinical trials and $2.1 million for our DEXTENZA for ocular inflammation and pain following cataract surgery which was in Phase 3 clinical trials and $0.7 million for our DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of dry eye disease which was in Phase 2 clinical trials. Unallocated research and development costs increased $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in unallocated personnel costs of $2.3 million, relating to additional hiring primarily in our clinical, regulatory and quality department and an increase in stock-based compensation expense and the write off of $1.3 million of equipment that was in construction in process that is included in all other costs.\nIn addition to DEXTENZA and OTX-TP, we are engaged in the preclinical development of our hydrogel depot administered via intravitreal injection to address the large and growing markets for diseases and conditions of the back of the eye. Our initial development efforts are focused on the use of our extended-delivery hydrogel depot in combination with anti-angiogenic drugs, such as protein-based anti-VEGF drugs or small molecule drugs, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or TKIs, for the treatment of retinal diseases such as wet AMD, retinal vein occlusion and diabetic macular edema. Our initial goal for these programs is to provide extended delivery of a protein-based large molecule or small molecule TKI drug targeting VEGF and other targets over a four to six month period following administration of a bioresorbable hydrogel incorporating the drug by an injection into the vitreous humor, thereby reducing the frequency of the current monthly or bi-monthly intravitreal injection regimen for wet AMD and other retinal diseases and potentially providing a more consistent uniform release of drug over the treatment period.\nInventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, determined by the first-in, first-out method. Prior to initial approval by the FDA or other regulatory agencies of our products, we expense costs relating to the production of inventory in the period incurred as research and development expenses. After such time as the product receives approval, we begin to capitalize the inventory costs related to the product.\n \u00b7 employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development, clinical and regulatory and other related functions; \n \u00b7 the progress and status of our collaboration with Regeneron, including any development costs for which we reimburse Regeneron, the potential exercise by Regeneron of its option for a license for the development and potential commercialization of products containing our extended-delivery hydrogel depot in combination with Regeneron's large molecule VEGF-targeting compounds, and our potential receipt of future milestone payments from Regeneron; \nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \u00b7 vendors in connection with preclinical development activities; \nOperating activities. Net cash used in operating activities was $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily resulting from our net loss of $44.7 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $7.2 million and cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $2.1 million. Our net loss was primarily attributed to research and development activities and our general and administrative expenses partially offset by $1.9 million of revenue in the period. Our net non-cash charges during the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily consisted of $6.0 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.9 million of depreciation expense. Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted primarily of a $1.4 million increase in accrued expenses and deferred rent, a $0.9 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a $0.2 million increase in accounts payable, which was due to the timing of vendor invoicing and payments.\nThese assumptions represented our best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different. We recognize compensation expense for only the portion of awards that are expected to vest. In developing a forfeiture rate estimate for pre-vesting forfeitures, we have considered our historical experience of actual forfeitures. If our future actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, our stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and should be read together with the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\n \u00b7 renovate our new facility, including research and development laboratories, manufacturing space and office space; \ngovernment or other third-party funding, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and marketing and distribution arrangements. We do not have any committed external source of funds other than amounts we may receive from Regeneron for potential option exercise, development, regulatory and sales milestones and royalties under our collaboration and amounts we may be able to draw under our amended credit facility upon the achievement of regulatory and commercial milestones. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. The covenants under our existing credit facility, the pledge of our assets as collateral and the negative pledge of intellectual property limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing. If we raise additional funds through government or other third-party funding, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $33.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily resulting from our net loss of $39.7 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $5.6 million and cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $0.5 million. Our net loss was primarily attributed to research and development activities and our general and administrative expenses partially offset by $1.8 million of revenue in the period. Our net non-cash charges during the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily consisted of $4.6 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million of depreciation expense. Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of a $0.2 million increase in accrued expenses and deferred rent and a $0.3 million increase in accounts payable, which was due to the timing of vendor invoicing and payments, both partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $0.1 million.\nThe table below summarizes our research and development expenses incurred by product development program:\nWe base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple CROs that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed, enrollment of patients, number of sites activated and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, we have not made any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.\nResearch and development expenses were $27.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $26.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $0.4 million was primarily due to a decrease of $2.9 million in clinical trial and regulatory expenses and an increase of $3.3 million in unallocated expenses. Clinical trial and regulatory expenses decreased in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the timing and number of clinical trials being conducted for the DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis and dry eye disease.\n \u00b7 the costs of advancing our internal development efforts for the back-of-the-eye program through the remaining preclinical steps and potentially into an initial clinical trial; \nThrough December 31, 2016, we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our preferred stock, public offerings of our common stock and borrowings under credit facilities. In July 2014, we completed our IPO, and in August 2014 the underwriters in our IPO exercised their over-allotment option in full. We received total net proceeds of approximately $66.4 million from the issuance and sale of 5,750,000 shares of common stock, including in connection with the exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering costs. In June 2015, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock at a public offering price of $22.00 per share. The offering consisted of 4,600,000 shares of common stock, of which 3,200,000 shares were issued and sold by us and 1,400,000 shares were sold by certain stockholders, including those shares sold in connection with the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. We received net proceeds from the follow-on offering of approximately $65.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and offering expenses. In November 2016, we entered into the 2016 ATM Agreement with Cantor, under which we may offer and sell our common stock having aggregate proceeds of up to $40.0 million from time to time. To date, we have sold 263,418 shares of common stock under the 2016 ATM Agreement at a weighted average exercise price of $8.87 per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately $2.0 million after underwriting discounts, commission and other offering expenses. In January 2017, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock at a public offering price of $7.00 per share. The offering consisted of 3,571,429 shares of common stock sold by us. We received net proceeds from the follow-on offering of approximately $23.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts expenses.\nWe expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the clinical trials of our products in development and increase our sales and marketing resources focused on the potential launch of our product candidates including DEXTENZA, subject to receiving FDA approval.\nSince our inception in 2006, we have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in each year or our earned research and development tax credits, due to our uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items. As of December 31, 2016, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $85.2 million, which begin to expire in 2026, and state net operating loss carryforwards of $73.9 million, which begin to expire in 2029. As of December 31, 2016, we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of $4.1 million and state research and development tax credit carryforwards $2.1 million, which begin to expire in 2026 and 2025, respectively. We have not completed a study to assess whether an ownership change, generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in the equity ownership of our corporate entity over a three-year period, has occurred or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since our inception, due to the significant costs and complexities associated with such studies. Accordingly, our ability to utilize our tax carryforwards may be limited. Additionally, U.S. tax laws limit the time during which these carryforwards may be utilized against future taxes. As a result, we may not be able to take full advantage of these carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $10.3 million in direct research and development expenses for our intracanalicular insert product candidates, including $2.1 million for our DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain which was in Phase 3 clinical trials, $5.5 million for our DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis which was in Phase 3 clinical trials, $0.7 million for our DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of dry eye disease which was in Phase 2 clinical trials, and $2.0 million for our OTX-TP product candidate for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension which was in Phase 2b clinical trials. In comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred $6.0 million in direct research and development expenses for our intracanalicular insert product candidates, including $2.0 million for clinical trials of OTX-TP for glaucoma and ocular hypertension which was in Phase 2a clinical trials, $1.8 million for our DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis which was in Phase 2a clinical trials and $2.2 million for our DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain which was in Phase 3 clinical trials. Unallocated research and development costs decreased $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. In the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a one-time, non-cash expense of $1.7 million for a license fee paid in the form of stock which is included in the unallocated costs. In addition, unallocated personnel costs increased by $3.5 million, relating to additional hiring primarily in our clinical, regulatory and quality department and an increase in stock-based compensation expense.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include facility-related costs and professional fees for legal, patent, consulting and accounting and audit services.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nIn July 2014, we completed an initial public offering, or IPO, of our common stock, and in August 2014 the underwriters in our IPO exercised their over-allotment option in full. We received total net proceeds of approximately $66.4 million from the issuance and sale of 5,750,000 shares of common stock, including in connection with the exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering costs. In June 2015, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock at a public offering price of $22.00 per share. The offering consisted of 4,600,000 shares of common stock, of which 3,200,000 shares were issued and sold by us and 1,400,000 shares were sold by certain of our stockholders, including those shares sold in connection with the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. We received net proceeds from the follow-on offering of approximately $65.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. In November 2016, we entered into an At-the-Market Sales Agreement, or the 2016 ATM Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., or Cantor, under which we may offer and sell our common stock having aggregate proceeds of up to $40.0 million from time to time. As of February 28, 2017, we have sold 263,418 shares of common stock under the 2016 ATM Agreement at a weighted average exercise price of $8.87 per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately $2.0 million after underwriting discounts, commission and other offering expenses. In January 2017, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock at a public offering price of $7.00 per share. The offering consisted of 3,571,429 shares of common stock sold by us. We received net proceeds from the follow-on offering of approximately $23.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts expenses. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, will enable us to fund our operating expenses, debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2018. We will need to obtain additional capital to the support the planned commercial launch of DEXTENZA, subject to FDA approval. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nIn the table above, we set forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations and future commitments at December 31, 2016, as well as obligations related to contracts that we are likely to continue, regardless of the fact that they may be cancelable at December 31, 2016. Some of the figures that we include in this table are based on management's estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, and other factors. Because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (ASU 2016-15). ASU 2016-15 is intended to add or clarify guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows and to eliminate the diversity in practice related to such classifications. The guidance in ASU 2016-15 is required for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the potential impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-15 on our statement of cash flows.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $2.3 million was due to a $0.8 million increase in personnel related costs and an increase of $1.6 million in professional fees, partially offset by a decrease of $0.1 million in facility-related and other costs. Our personnel related costs increased due primarily to hiring in our general and administrative function. Professional fees increased primarily due to increased activities to support our operating as a public company for a full year.\nIn December 2015, we amended the credit facility to increase the aggregate principal amount to $15.6 million to capitalize certain accrued interest. The amended facility provides for monthly, interest-only payments on outstanding borrowings through December 2016. Thereafter, we were required to pay thirty-six consecutive, equal monthly installments of principal and interest through December 1, 2019. In March 2017, we further amended the credit facility to increase the total commitment to $38.0 million including $18.0 million of borrowings drawn at closing, which was used primarily to pay-off outstanding balances as of the closing date, and options on two additional tranches of $10.0 million each contingent upon on the achievement by us of regulatory and commercial milestones. The interest-only payment period was extended through February 1, 2018 and can be further extended upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones. There are no financial covenants associated with the credit facility. There are negative covenants restricting our activities, including limitations on dispositions, mergers or acquisitions; encumbering our intellectual property; incurring indebtedness or liens; paying dividends; making investments; and engaging in certain other business transactions. The obligations under the credit facility are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of specified events of default, including a material adverse change in our business, operations or financial or other condition. The credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets except for our intellectual property, which is subject to a negative pledge.\nJOBS Act\nWe entered into a feasibility agreement with a biotechnology company relating to our intravitreal drug delivery depot in October 2014. Under this agreement, the biotechnology company had agreed to pay us up to $0.7 million, of which $0.3 million was a non-refundable up-front payment due upon contract execution and $0.4 million will be due upon the achievement of certain milestones. Initially, we were recognizing the non-refundable, non-contingent up-front payment of $0.3 million as revenue on a straight-line basis over the twelve-month period in which we are expected to complete our performance obligations. Estimates of this development period involves the evaluation of many assumptions and uncertainties and may change if facts and circumstances change. During 2015, management reevaluated and revised the estimated development period to extend through March 2016. If and when a contingent milestone payment is earned, the additional consideration to be received will be added to the total expected payments under the contract and recognized as revenue based on the proportional performance methodology. In January 2015, we achieved the first milestone under the feasibility agreement triggering a payment due of $0.3 million. This agreement was terminated in the second quarter of 2016 and the Company does not have any further obligations. Through December 31, 2016, the Company had recognized revenue of $0.5 million related to this agreement.\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, accrued research and development expenses and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n2016, and extend the maturity date to December 1, 2019. The outstanding borrowings under this facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to 8.25%. In March 2017, we amended the credit facility to increase the total commitment to $38.0 million including $18.0 million of borrowings drawn at closing, which was used primarily to pay-off outstanding balances as of the closing date, and options on two additional tranches of $10.0 million each contingent on the achievement of regulatory and commercial milestones for DEXTENZA. The interest-only payment period was extended through February 1, 2018 and there are provisions to further extend the interest-only period based on the achievement of certain milestones. See -Contractual Obligations and Commitments\u201d for additional information.\nIn April 2014, we entered into a credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank and MidCap Financial SBIC, LP, pursuant to which we were able to borrow an aggregate principal amount of up to $20.0 million, of which we borrowed $15.0 million. We did not borrow the remaining $5.0 million, and this amount is no longer available to us. The credit facility carries a fixed annual interest rate of 8.25% on outstanding borrowings. In April 2014, we issued the lenders warrants to purchase 100,000 shares of our Series D-1 redeemable convertible preferred stock with an exercise price of $3.00 per share. Upon the closing of our IPO in July 2014, the preferred stock warrants became warrants to purchase an aggregate of 37,878 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $7.92 per share.\nInterest Income. Interest income consists primarily of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. In each of 2016, 2015, and 2014, our interest income has not been significant due to the low rates of interest being earned on our invested balances.\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\n \u00b7 approximately $2.0 million to $2.8 million for DEXTENZA for post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain; \n \u00b7 the extent to which we acquire or invest in other businesses, products and technologies. \n \u00b7 the level of product sales from any additional product for which we obtain marketing approval in the future; \nCash Flows\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our vendors and our clinical investigative sites.\nThe New Revenue Standards may be applied using one of two retrospective application methods: (1) a full retrospective approach for all periods presented, or (2) a modified retrospective approach that presents a cumulative effect as of the adoption date and additional required disclosures. We expect to adopt the New Revenue Standards in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective approach and are in the process of completing its initial analysis identifying the revenue streams that will be impacted by the adoption of this new standard and the impact to its financial statements and footnote disclosures.\n \u00b7 scale up our manufacturing processes and capabilities to support sales of commercial products, our ongoing clinical trials of our product candidates and commercialization of any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval, and expand our facilities to accommodate this scale up and the expected growth in personnel; \nSubsequently, the FASB has issued the following standards related to ASU 2014-09: ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),\u201d or ASU 2016-08; ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,\u201d or ASU 2016-10; ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,\u201d or ASU 2016-12; and ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d or ASU 2016-20, which are intended to provide additional guidance and clarity to ASU 2014-09. The Company must adopt ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-12 and ASU 2016-20 along with ASU 2014-09, which we collectively refer to as the New Revenue Standards.\nAt the inception of an arrangement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether: (1) the consideration is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone, (2) the consideration relates solely to past performance, and (3) the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone and the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether a milestone satisfies all of the criteria required to conclude that a milestone is substantive. Accordingly, pursuant to the guidance of ASC Topic 605-28, Revenue Recognition-Milestone Method, or ASC 605-28, revenue from milestone payments will be recognized in its entirety upon successful accomplishment of the milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\n\n \u00b7 seek to identify and develop additional product candidates, including through preclinical development activities associated with our back-of-the-eye program; \nFunding Requirements\n \u00b7 the costs of manufacturing, sales, marketing, distribution and other commercialization efforts with respect to any additional products for which we obtain marketing approval in the future; \n \u00b7 approximately $12.0 million to $15.0 million for OTX-TP for glaucoma and ocular hypertension; and \n\nInventory Valuation\n\n\nRegeneron Collaboration\nSelling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel in selling and marketing functions as well as consulting and advertising and promotion costs. Through December 31, 2014, we incurred selling and marketing expenses in connection with our first-generation surgical sealant product. In addition, we invested in sales and marketing resources in anticipation of an earlier approval of our surgical sealant product in the United States than we ultimately received from the FDA, as a result of a change in designation from a 510(k) to a PMA regulatory path. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we incurred selling and marketing expense in connection with ReSure Sealant, which we began commercializing in the first quarter of 2014.\nFor stock-based awards granted to consultants and nonemployees, we recognize compensation expense over the period during which services are rendered by such consultants and nonemployees until completed. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to completion of the service, we remeasure the fair value of these awards using the then-current fair value of our common stock and updated assumption inputs in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\n \u00b7 the amounts we receive, if any, from Regeneron for option exercise, development, regulatory and sales milestones and royalty payments under our collaboration; \nBack-of-the-Eye Programs\n \u00b7 expand our operational, financial and management systems and personnel, including personnel to support our clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts and our operations as a public company; \nAny changes in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates in clinical and preclinical development could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of these product candidates. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials or other testing beyond those that we currently expect or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development of that product candidate.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $44.7 million, $39.7 million and $28.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $173.9 million.\nSelling and Marketing Expenses\nWe generated $1.4 and $0.5 million of product revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, from sales of our ReSure Sealant product, for which we received FDA approval in January 2014. We generated $0.4 million and $0.3 million of revenue from our collaboration agreements in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nIn October 2016, we entered into Collaboration Agreement with Regeneron. If the Option is exercised, Regeneron will conduct further preclinical development and an initial clinical trial under a collaboration plan. We are obligated to reimburse Regeneron for certain development costs during the period through the completion of the initial clinical trial, subject to a cap of $25 million, which cap may be increased by up to $5 million under certain circumstances. We have not included in the table above any payments to Regeneron under this Collaboration Agreement as the timing of such payments are not known. Regeneron will be responsible for funding an initial preclinical tolerability study. We do not expect our funding requirements to be material over the next twelve months. If Regeneron elects to proceed with further development beyond the initial clinical trial, it will be solely responsible for conducting and funding further development and commercialization of product candidates.\n \u00b7 approximately $1.0 million to $1.2 million for DEXTENZA for allergic conjunctivitis; \n \u00b7 increase our product liability and clinical trial insurance coverage as we expand our clinical trials and commercialization efforts; and \n \u00b7 the extent to which we choose to establish additional collaboration, distribution or other marketing arrangements for our products and product candidates; \nOur direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to investigators, consultants, central laboratories and CROs in connection with our clinical trials and regulatory fees. We do not allocate employee and contractor-related costs, costs associated with our platform technology, costs related to manufacturing or purchasing clinical trial materials, and facility expenses, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific product development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product development programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We use internal resources in combination with third-party CROs, including clinical monitors and clinical research associates, to manage our clinical trials, monitor patient enrollment and perform data analysis for many of our clinical trials. These employees work across multiple development programs and, therefore, we do not track their costs by program.\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include:\nReSure\nWhenever we determine that an element is delivered over a period of time, revenue is recognized using either a proportional performance model or a straight-line model over the period of performance. At each reporting period, we reassess our cumulative measure of performance and make appropriate adjustments, if necessary. We recognize revenue using the proportional performance model whenever we can make reasonably reliable estimates of the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement. Revenue recognized under the proportional performance model at each reporting period is determined by multiplying the total expected payments under the contract (excluding payments contingent upon achievement of milestones) by the ratio of the level of effort incurred to date to the estimated total level of effort required to complete the performance obligations under the arrangement. Revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned, as determined using the proportional performance model as of each reporting period. Alternatively, if we cannot make reasonably reliable estimates the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement, then revenue under the arrangement is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period expected to complete our performance obligations. If and when a contingent milestone payment is earned, the additional consideration to be received is added to the total expected payments under the contract. Revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned, as determined on a straight-line basis as of the period end date. If we cannot reasonably estimate when our performance obligation period ends, then revenue is deferred until we can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation period ends.\n\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2016 and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods:\nWe recognize revenue when the following four criteria are met in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 605, Revenue Recognition: persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; delivery of goods has occurred through transfer of title and risk and rewards of ownership; the selling price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.\nSelling and Marketing Expenses\n\nOther Income (Expense)\n \u00b7 the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims; and \nWe estimate the fair value of each stock option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Use of this model requires that we make assumptions as to the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. Prior to our IPO, we had been a private company and lacked company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, we estimate our expected volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded group of peer companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our publicly traded stock price. Beginning in 2016, we estimate our expected volatility using a weighted average of the historical volatility of our publicly traded peer companies and the volatility of our common stock, and expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our traded stock price. We use the simplified method prescribed by Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate the expected term of options granted to employees and directors. We base the expected term of options granted to consultants and nonemployees on the contractual term of the options. We determine the risk-free interest rate by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued development and commercialization of our product candidates. We also anticipate to continue to incur increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance, director and officer insurance costs as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with being a public company.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\n \u00b7 continue the research and development of our other product candidates; \n \u00b7 expenses associated with preclinical development activities; and \nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advanced payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\n \u00b7 the costs of expanding our facilities to accommodate our manufacturing needs and expected growth in personnel; \nFollowing our receipt of FDA approval for ReSure Sealant, we commercially launched this product in the United States in 2014, initially through a network of ophthalmology-focused distributors. In early 2017, we terminated these distributors and hired a contract sales force of four representatives to sell ReSure Sealant. ReSure Sealant is approved to seal corneal incisions following cataract surgery and is the first and only surgical sealant to be approved by the FDA for ophthalmic use. In the pivotal clinical trials that formed the basis for FDA approval, ReSure Sealant provided superior wound closure and a better safety profile than sutured closure.\n \u00b7 the efficacy and potential advantages of our product candidates compared to alternative treatments, including any standard of care; \nOther Income (Expense), Net. In 2014, other income (expense), net consisted primarily of the gain or loss associated with the change in the fair value of our preferred stock warrant liability and small amounts of miscellaneous income and expense items unrelated to core operations. We issued warrants for the purchase of our redeemable convertible preferred stock that we believed were financial instruments that could require a transfer of assets because of the redemption feature of the underlying stock. Therefore, we classified these warrants as liabilities and they were remeasured to fair value at each reporting period, and we recorded the changes in the fair value as a component of other income (expense), net. Upon the closing of our IPO in July 2014, the underlying redeemable convertible preferred stock was converted into common stock, the preferred stock warrants became exercisable for common stock instead of preferred stock, and the fair value of the warrant liability became fixed as of that date and was reclassified to additional paid-in capital. In 2015 and 2016, other income (expense), net consists of small amounts of miscellaneous income and expense items unrelated to our core operations.\nOther contingent, event-based payments received for which payment is either contingent solely upon the passage of time or the results of a collaborative partner's performance would not be considered milestones under ASC 605-28. In accordance with ASC 605-25, such payments will be recognized as revenue when all of the four basic revenue recognition criteria are met.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate product revenues sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of revenue from sales of ReSure Sealant, equity offerings, debt financings,\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\nNet cash used in operating activities was $20.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily resulting from our net loss of $28.6 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $6.0 million and cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $2.2 million. Our net loss was primarily attributed to research and development activities and our general and administrative expenses partially offset by $0.8 million of revenue in the period. Our net non-cash charges during the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily consisted of $2.4 million of licensing and consultant fees paid in common stock, $2.6 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.5 million of depreciation expense. Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted primarily of a $1.9 million increase in accrued expenses and deferred rent and a $0.5 million increase in accounts payable, which was due to the timing of vendor invoicing and payments, both partially offset by an increase in inventory of $0.1 million.\nWe estimate that we will incur external research and development expenses for 2017, as follows:\nWe have generated limited revenue to date. In the first quarter of 2014, we began recognizing revenue from sales of ReSure Sealant. All of our sustained drug delivery products are in various phases of clinical and preclinical development. We do not expect sales of ReSure Sealant to generate revenue that is sufficient for us to achieve profitability. Instead, our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on our obtaining marketing approval for and commercializing products with greater market potential, including one or both of DEXTENZA and OTX-TP. Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $44.7 million, $39.7 million and $28.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $173.9 million.\nBased on our current plans and forecasted expenses, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will enable us to fund our operating expenses, debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2018. We will need to obtain additional capital to support the planned commercial launch of DEXTENZA, subject to FDA approval. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect.\n\n\nWe anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:\nRevenue Recognition\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) - Restricted Cash,\u201d ( ASU 2016-18\u201d). ASU 2016-18 requires a statement of cash flows to explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. We are currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on our financial statements and footnote disclosures.\nFinancial Operations Overview\n \u00b7 the scope, progress, outcome and costs of our clinical trials and other research and development activities; \nSubsequent to the approval of ReSure Sealant in January 2014, we started to capitalize inventory of this product. We review our inventories for potential obsolescence.\nRevenue\n \u00b7 not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements; \nResearch and Development Expenses\nManufacturing commitments generally provide for termination on notice, and therefore are cancelable contracts but are contracts that we are likely to continue, regardless of the fact that they are cancelable.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $68.1 million. In April 2014, we borrowed $15.0 million in aggregate principal amount under a new credit facility and used $1.9 million of this amount to repay $1.7 million aggregate principal amount of indebtedness and pay $0.2 million of other amounts due in connection with our termination of a prior credit facility. In December 2015, we amended our credit facility to increase the aggregate principal amount to $15.6 million, extend the interest-only payment period through December\n \u00b7 investigative sites or

biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapies for diseases and conditions of the eye. \n- Lead product candidates are DEXTENZA (for post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain) and OTX-TP (for glaucoma and ocular hypertension). Also have a preclinical intravitreal hydrogel depot for wet AMD and other back-of-the-eye diseases.\n- Have limited revenue to date, generated from sales of ReSure Sealant product. Not yet profitable, will depend on obtaining marketing approval and commercializing DEXTENZA, OTX-TP or other products. \n- Have had significant operating losses since inception, were $44.7M in 2016. Have accumulated deficit of $173.9M as of December 31, 2016.\n\nFinancial Position\n- Had $68.1M in cash, cash equivalents and marketables securities as of December 31, 2016. Believe this is sufficient to fund operations into Q2 2018.\n- Will need additional capital to support planned DEXTENZA commercial launch.\n\nRecent Financing Activities\n- IPO in 2014 raised net proceeds of $66.4M. Follow-on offering in 2015 raised net proceeds of $65.6M. Entered ATM agreement in 2016 for up to $40M in sales. Completed follow-on offering in January 2017 for net proceeds of $23.5M.\n\nRevenues \n- Generated limited revenue to date. Began recognizing ReSure Sealant sales revenue in 2014. No products yet generate sufficient revenue to achieve profitability.\n\nR&D Expenses\n- Were $27.1M in 2016 versus $26.6M in 2015. Increase due to rise in unallocated expenses offset by decreased clinical trial costs.\n- Estimate $33-35M of R&D expenses expected in 2017.\n\nG&A Expenses \n- Were $11.0M in 2016 versus $9.2M in 2015. Increase primarily due to personnel costs and professional fees.\n\nRegulatory Update\n- Resubmitted NDA for DEXTENZA in January 2017, which FDA accepted in February 2017 with PDUFA date of July 19, 2017.\n\nRegeneron Collaboration\n- Entered collaboration agreement in October 2016. Includes $10M upfront payment, opt-in option, milestones and royalties.\n\nThat covers the key points from the report. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions."}
