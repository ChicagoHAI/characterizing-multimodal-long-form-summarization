In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. Puget Energy's and PSE's actual results could differ materially from results that may be anticipated by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this report. Except as required by law, neither Puget Energy nor PSE undertakes an obligation to revise any forward-looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may subsequently arise. Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made in this report and in Puget Energy's and PSE's other reports filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect Puget Energy's and PSE's business, prospects and results of operations.\nOverview\nPuget Energy is an energy services holding company and substantially all of its operations are conducted through its subsidiary PSE, a regulated electric and natural gas utility company. PSE is the largest electric and natural gas utility in the state of Washington, primarily engaged in the business of electric transmission, distribution and generation and natural gas distribution. Puget Energy's business strategy is to generate stable cash flows by offering reliable electric and natural gas service in a cost-effective manner through PSE. Puget Energy also has a wholly-owned non-regulated subsidiary, Puget LNG, LLC (Puget LNG). Puget LNG was formed on November 29, 2016, and has the sole purpose of owning, developing and financing the non-regulated activity of the Tacoma LNG facility, currently under construction. All of Puget Energy's common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings, LLC (Puget Holdings). Puget Holdings is owned by a consortium of long-term infrastructure investors including Macquarie Infrastructure Partners, Macquarie Capital Group Limited, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation, and the Alberta Investment Management Corporation. Puget Energy and PSE are collectively referred to herein as the Company.\u201d\nPSE generates revenue and cash flow primarily from the sale of electric and natural gas services to residential and commercial customers within a service territory covering approximately 6,000 square miles, principally in the Puget Sound region of the state of Washington. PSE continually balances its load requirements, generation resources, purchase power agreements, and market purchases to meet customer demand. The Company's external financing requirements principally reflect the cash needs of its construction program, its schedule of maturing debt and certain operational needs. PSE requires access to bank and capital markets to meet its financing needs.\nFactors affecting PSE's performance are set forth in this Overview\u201d section, as well as in other sections of the Management's Discussion and Analysis.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), as well as return on equity (ROE) excluding unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments (net income plus unrealized losses and/or minus unrealized gains on derivative instruments divided by average common equity) that is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.\u201d Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that includes adjustments that result in a departure from GAAP presentation. The Company believes that return on average of monthly averages (AMA) equity, also a non-GAAP measure, is a more suitable metric for comparing ROE across years and is a more accurate metric for assessing and evaluating ROE performance against the Company's authorized regulated ROE. The AMA equity is not intended to represent the regulated equity. PSE's ROE may not be comparable to other companies' ROE measures. Furthermore, this measure is not intended to replace ROE (GAAP net income divided by GAAP average common equity) as an indicator of operating performance.\nThe following table presents PSE's ROE, its return on AMA equity and its authorized regulated ROE for 2017 and 2016:\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\nEarnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Common Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Return on Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Common Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Return on Equity\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on equity\n</td> <td>$320,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$3,545,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$380,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$3,426,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less/Plus: Unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments, after-tax\n</td> <td>20,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(54,467)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less/Plus: Equity adjustments1\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>169,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>177,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Impact of average of monthly average (AMA)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on AMA equity\n</td> <td>$340,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$3,793,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$326,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$3,661,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Authorized regulated return on equity2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.8%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>Equity adjustments are related to removing the impacts of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), subsidiary retained earnings, retained earnings of derivative instruments, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2\n</td> <td>The authorized regulated return on equity rate changed to 9.5% effective December 19, 2017, per the approved GRC.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>*\n</td> <td>Not meaningful and/or applicable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's 2017 return on AMA equity was 9.0%, which is lower than the authorized regulated ROE primarily due to the following:\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Regulated equity (rate base time's equity percent) was $478.0 million lower than AMA equity for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Because PSE intends to seek recovery of such investments through the regulatory process, its financial results depend heavily upon favorable outcomes from that process. The principal business, economic and other factors that affect PSE's operations and financial performance include:\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The rates PSE is allowed to charge for its services;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>PSE's ability to recover power costs that are included in rates, which are based on volume;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Weather conditions, including the impact of temperature on customer load; the impact of extreme weather events on budgeted maintenance costs; meteorological conditions such as snow-pack, stream-flow and wind-speed which affect power generation, supply and price;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Regulatory decisions allowing PSE to recover purchased power and fuel costs, on a timely basis;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>PSE's ability to supply electricity and natural gas, either through company-owned generation, purchase power contracts or by procuring natural gas or electricity in wholesale markets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Equal sharing between PSE and its customers of earnings which exceed PSE's authorized rate of return;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Availability and access to capital and the cost of capital;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Regulatory compliance costs, including those related to new and developing federal regulations of electric system reliability, state regulations of natural gas pipelines and federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Wholesale commodity prices of electricity and natural gas;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increasing capital expenditures with additional depreciation and amortization;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Tax reform, the effect of lower tax rates, and regulatory treatment of excess deferred tax balances on rate base and customer rates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>General economic conditions in PSE's service territory and its effects on customer growth and use-per-customer; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Federal, state, and local taxes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRegulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs\nThe rates that PSE is allowed to charge for its services influence its financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. PSE is highly regulated and the rates that it charges its retail customers are approved by the Washington Commission. The Washington Commission has traditionally required these rates be determined based, to a large extent, on historic test year costs plus weather normalized assumptions about hydroelectric conditions and power costs in the relevant rate year. Incremental customer growth and sales typically have not provided sufficient revenue to cover general cost increases over time due to the combined effects of regulatory lag and attrition. In addition, the Washington Commission determines whether the Company's expenses and capital investments are reasonable and prudent for the provision of cost effective, reliable and safe electric and natural gas service. If the Washington Commission determines that an operating expense or capital investment does not meet the reasonable and prudent standards, the costs (including return on any resulting rate base) related to such operating expense or capital investment may be disallowed, partially or entirely, and not recovered in rates.\nDuring 2013, PSE completed an expedited rate filing (ERF), which was a limited scope rate proceeding, and established a decoupling mechanism for natural gas operations and electric transmission, distribution and administrative costs. The ERF proceeding established baseline rates on which the decoupling mechanism will operate during the rate plan period. The ERF also established a property tax tracker mechanism in which any difference between amounts in rates and property tax payments will be deferred and recovered in an annual filing based on the actual cash payments for the year.\nThe decoupling mechanism allows PSE to recover delivery costs on a per customer basis rather than on a consumption basis. Included in the decoupling petition was a rate plan that allows PSE an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return without the need for another GRC process during the rate plan period. The rate plan included predetermined annual increases to PSE's allowed electric and natural gas revenue. This plan required PSE to file a GRC no later than April 1, 2016, which was later extended to January 17, 2017. The GRC was filed with the Washington Commission on January 13, 2017.\nWashington state law also requires PSE to pursue electric conservation that is cost-effective, reliable and feasible. PSE's mandate to pursue electric conservation initiatives may have a negative impact on the electric business financial performance due to lost margins from lower sales volumes as variable power costs are not part of the decoupling mechanism. Although not specified by Washington state law, the Washington Commission also sets natural gas conservation achievement standards for PSE. The effects of achieving these standards will, however, have only a slight negative impact on natural gas business financial performance due to the natural gas business being almost fully decoupled.\n2013 Expedited Rate Filing and Decoupling Decision\nIn 2013, the Washington Commission issued final orders resolving the amended decoupling petition, the ERF filing and the Petition for Reconsideration (related to the TransAlta Centralia power purchase agreement). Order No. 7 in the ERF/decoupling proceeding approved PSE's ERF filing with a small change to its cost of capital to 7.77% which updated long-term debt costs and a capital structure that included 48.0% common equity with a return on equity (ROE) of 9.8%. This order also approved the property tax tracker discussed below and approved the amended decoupling and rate plan filing with the further condition that PSE will share 50.0% of any earnings in excess of the 7.77% authorized rate of return with customers. In addition, the K-Factor (rate plan) increase allowed decoupling revenue per customer for the recovery of delivery system costs to subsequently increase by 3.0% per year for electric customers and 2.2% per year for natural gas customers on January 1 of each year, until the effective date of new rates in PSE's General Rate Case (GRC). The new rates became effective December 19, 2017, as discussed below. In the decoupling mechanism, increases were subject to a cap of 3.0% of the total revenue for customers.\nGeneral Rate Case Filing\nOn January 13, 2017, PSE filed its GRC with the Washington Commission the settlement agreement was accepted by the Washington Commission on December 5, 2017 and the rates became effective December 19, 2017. For further details regarding the 2017 GRC filing, see Note 3, \"Regulation and Rates\" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.\nDecoupling Filings\nOn December 5, 2017, the Washington Commission approved PSE's request within the 2017 GRC to extend the decoupling mechanism with some changes to the methodology that took effect on December 19, 2017. Electric and natural gas delivery revenues will continue to be recovered on a per customer basis and electric fixed production energy costs will now be decoupled and recovered on a fixed monthly amount basis. The allowed decoupling revenue will no longer increase annually on January 1 for electric and natural gas customers and these amounts can only be changed in a GRC, Power Cost Only Rate Case (PCORC) or ERF filing. Other changes include regrouping of electric and natural gas non-residential customers and the exclusion of certain electric schedules from the decoupling mechanism going forward. The rate cap which limits the amount of revenues PSE can collect in its annual filings increased from 3.0% to 5.0% for natural gas customers but will remain at 3.0% for electric customers. The decoupling mechanism will end on the effective date of PSE's first GRC filed in or after 2021, or in a separate proceeding if appropriate unless the continuation of the mechanism is approved in either of those proceedings. PSE's decoupling mechanism over and under collections will still be collectible or refundable after this effective date even if the decoupling mechanism is not extended.\nThe Washington Commission approved the following PSE requests to change rates under its electric and natural gas decoupling mechanisms:\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average\nPercentage\nIncrease (Decrease)\nin Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nin Revenue\n(Dollars in Millions)1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$41.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 1, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural Gas:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$22.4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 1, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.0\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>The increase in revenue is net of reductions from excess earnings of $11.9 million for electric and $2.2 million for natural gas effective May1, 2017, and $11.9 million for electric and $5.5 million for natural gas effective May 1, 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs noted earlier, at the time of the filings below, the Company was also limited to a 3.0% annual decoupling related cap on increases in total revenue.

The power cost baseline\u201d levels are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydrological conditions. Excess power costs or savings are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism and will trigger a surcharge or refund when the cumulative deferral trigger is reached.\nThe graduated scale that was applicable through December 31, 2016 was as follows:\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annual Power Cost Variability\n</td> <td>Company's Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Customers' Share\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+/- $20 million\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+/- $20 million - $40 million\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+/- $40 million - $120 million\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+/- $120 + million\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn August 7, 2015, the Washington Commission issued an order approving the changes to the PCA mechanism.

The deferral period requested was January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, when rates went into effect from PSE's 2017 GRC. On November 10, 2016, the Washington Commission issued Order No. 01 approving PSE's accounting petition. With the final determination in PSE's GRC, this deferral ceased with the rate effective date of December 19, 2017.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, in its PCA mechanism, PSE under recovered its power costs by $11.5 million of which no amount was apportioned to customers. This compares to an under recovery of power costs of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 of which no amounts were apportioned to customers. Although load increased in 2017 compared to 2016, that increase was offset by a decrease in the total baseline rate and an increase in costs. Additionally, the year over year variance was due to the 2017 mechanism changes where fixed production costs, other costs and adjustments are no longer included. The mechanism is now comparing variable PCA costs using the variable costs portion of the baseline rate. The fixed costs became part of the decoupling mechanism, effective December 19, 2017 as a result of the GRC but until then the revenue variance associated with the fixed production costs are being deferred using the fixed cost portion of the baseline rate. The revenue variance associated with the fixed production costs was deferred using the fixed cost portion of the baseline rate until December 19, 2017, when the fixed costs became part of the decoupling mechanism with the resolution of PSE's GRC.\nElectric Conservation Rider\nThe following table sets forth conservation rider rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE's revenue based on the effective dates:\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average\nPercentage\nIncrease (Decrease)\nin Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nin Revenue\n(Dollars in Millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$16.5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.7)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 1, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFederal Incentive Tracker Tariff\nThe following table sets forth Federal Incentive Tracker Tariff rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE's revenue based on the effective dates:\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average\nPercentage\nIncrease (Decrease)\nin Rates from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total credit to be passed back to eligible customers\n(Dollars in Millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January 1, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(48.2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51.7)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(57.3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January 1, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55.2)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPower Cost Only Rate Case and Update Compliance Filing\nThe following table sets forth PCORC and update compliance filing rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE's revenue based on the effective dates:\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average\nPercentage\nIncrease (Decrease)\nin Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nin Revenue\n(Dollars in Millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(37.3)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResidential Exchange Benefit\nThe residential exchange program passes through the residential exchange program benefits that PSE will be receiving from the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) between October 1, 2017 and September 30, 2019.

Subsequent to that tariff filing, parties to the case reached an all-party settlement that converted the tariff to a special contract only allowing retail access for the loads of the Microsoft Corporation currently being served under PSE's electric Schedule 40. The special contract includes the following conditions: (i) Microsoft exceed Washington State's current renewable portfolio standards, (ii) the remainder of power sold to it be carbon free, (iii) there be no reduction in its funding of PSE's conservation programs, (iv) an exit fee be paid that will be a straight pass-through to customers and (v) Microsoft fund enhanced low-income support. A definitive agreement among the parties, the special contract and supportive testimony were filed with the Washington Commission on April 11, 2017 with hearings that occurred on May 3, 2017. The Washington Commission issued an order on July 13, 2017 approving PSE's special contract with Microsoft. Microsoft cannot begin taking service under the special contract until it has the required metering installed, has contracts for the supply and transmission of its power supply and pays the exit fee. PSE currently anticipates these conditions will be met in early 2019.\nVoluntary Long-Term Renewable Energy\nOn September 28, 2016, the Washington Commission approved PSE's tariff revision to create an additional voluntary renewable energy product, effective September 30, 2016. This provides customers with energy choices to help them meet their sustainability goals. Incremental costs of the program will be allocated to the voluntary participants of the program as is the case with PSE's existing Green Power programs. PSE initially offered this service, Green Direct, to larger customers (aggregated annual loads greater than 10,000,000 kWh) and government customers. Approximately 136.8 MW of new wind generation facilities will be constructed in the region by a developer under contract to PSE to meet the demand for this voluntary renewable energy product project. PSE anticipates that customers will start receiving energy through this program in 2019.\nFor additional information, see Business, \"Regulation and Rates\" included in Item 1 of this report.\nAccess to Debt Capital\nPSE relies on access to bank borrowings and short-term money markets as sources of liquidity and longer-term capital markets to fund its utility construction program, to meet maturing debt obligations and other capital expenditure requirements not satisfied by cash flow from its operations or equity investment from its parent, Puget Energy. Neither Puget Energy nor PSE have any debt outstanding whose maturity would accelerate upon a credit rating downgrade. However, a ratings downgrade could adversely affect the Company's ability to renew existing, or obtain access to new credit facilities and could increase the cost of such facilities. For example, under Puget Energy's and PSE's credit facilities, the borrowing costs increase as their respective credit ratings decline due to increases in credit spreads and commitment fees. If PSE is unable to access debt capital on reasonable terms, its ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions, including generating capacity, which may be relied on for future growth and to otherwise implement its strategy, could be adversely affected. PSE monitors the credit environment and expects to continue to be able to access the capital markets to meet its short-term and long-term borrowing needs. In October 2017, PSE and Puget Energy each entered into new 5-year credit facilities that replaced the previous facilities and are scheduled to mature in October 2022. For additional information on credit facilities, see Note 7, Liquidity Facilities and Other Financing Arrangements\" included in Item 8 of this report.\nRegulatory Compliance Costs and Expenditures\nPSE's operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. These regulations cover electric system reliability, natural gas pipeline system safety and energy market transparency, among other areas. Environmental laws and regulations related to air and water quality, including climate change and endangered species protection, waste handling and disposal (including generation by-products such as coal ash), remediation of contamination and siting new facilities also impact the Company's operations. PSE must spend a significant amount of resources to fulfill requirements set by regulatory agencies, many of which have greatly expanded mandates on measures including resource planning, remediation, monitoring, pollution control equipment and emissions-related abatement and fees.\nCompliance with these or other future regulations, such as those pertaining to climate change, could require significant capital expenditures by PSE and may adversely affect PSE's financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nOther Challenges and Strategies\nCompetition\nPSE's electric and natural gas utility retail customers generally do not have the ability to choose their electric or natural gas supplier; and therefore, PSE's business has historically been recognized as a natural monopoly. However, PSE faces competition from public utility districts and municipalities that want to establish their own municipal-owned utility, as a result of which PSE may lose a number of customers. Further, PSE faces increasing competition for sales to its retail customers. Alternative methods of electric energy generation, including solar and other self-generation methods, compete with PSE for sales to existing electric retail customers. In addition, PSE's natural gas customers may elect to use heating oil, propane or other fuels instead of using and purchasing natural gas from PSE.\nResults of Operations\nPuget Sound Energy\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this document. The following discussion provides the significant items that impacted PSE's results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures - Electric and Natural Gas Margins\nThe following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as two other financial measures, electric margin and natural gas margin, that are considered non-GAAP financial measures.\u201d Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that includes adjustments that result in a departure from GAAP presentation. The presentation of electric margin and natural gas margin is intended to supplement an understanding of PSE's operating performance. Electric margin and natural gas margin are used by PSE to determine whether PSE is collecting the appropriate amount of revenue from its customers to maintain electric and natural gas margins to ultimately provide adequate recovery of operating costs, including interest and equity returns. PSE's electric margin and natural gas margin measures may not be comparable to other companies' electric margin and natural gas margin measures. Furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance.\nElectric Margin\nElectric margin represents electric sales to retail and transportation customers less the cost of generating and purchasing electric energy sold to customers, including transmission costs to bring electric energy to PSE's service territory.\nThe following chart displays the changes in PSE's electric margin from 2016 to 2017:\n_______________\n* Includes decoupling cash collections, rate of return excess earnings, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve.\n2016 compared to 2017\nElectric Operating Revenue\nElectric operating revenues increased $182.2 million primarily due to higher retail sales of $112.5 million, increased transportation and other revenue of $92.5 million, partially offset by decreased decoupling revenue of $20.0 million and other decoupling revenue of $6.5 million. These items are discussed in detail below:\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Electric retail sales increased $112.5 million due an increase of $100.0 million from additional retail electricity usage of 4.2% compared to the prior year and an increase in rates of $12.5 million due to the decoupling rate mechanism.

The Company anticipates refinancing the redemption of bonds or other long-term borrowings with its credit facilities and/or the issuance of new long-term debt. Access to funds depends upon factors such as Puget Energy's and PSE's credit ratings, prevailing interest rates and investor receptivity to investing in the utility industry, Puget Energy and PSE. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity through its credit facilities and access to capital markets to fund its needs over the next twelve months.\nProceeds from PSE's short-term borrowings and sales of commercial paper are used to provide working capital and the interim funding of utility construction programs. Puget Energy and PSE continue to have reasonable access to the capital and credit markets.\nFor information on Puget Energy and PSE dividends, long-term debt and credit facilities, see Note 4, Dividend Payment Restrictions, Note 6, Long-term Debt\u201d and Note 7, Liquidity Facilities and Other Financing Arrangements\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.\nDebt Restrictive Covenants\nThe type and amount of future long-term financings for PSE may be limited by provisions in PSE's electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.\nPSE's ability to issue additional secured debt may also be limited by certain restrictions contained in its electric and natural gas mortgage indentures. Under the most restrictive tests, at December 31, 2017, PSE could issue:\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Approximately $2.6 billion of additional first mortgage bonds under PSE's electric mortgage indenture based on approximately $4.3 billion of electric bondable property available for issuance, subject to an interest coverage ratio limitation of 2.0 times net earnings available for interest (as defined in the electric utility mortgage), which PSE exceeded at December 31, 2017; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Approximately $535.0 million of additional first mortgage bonds under PSE's natural gas mortgage indenture based on approximately $891.7 million of natural gas bondable property available for issuance, subject to a combined natural gas and electric interest coverage test of 1.75 times net earnings available for interest and a natural gas interest coverage test of 2.0 times net earnings available for interest (as defined in the natural gas utility mortgage), both of which PSE exceeded at December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n</table> At December 31, 2017, PSE had approximately $7.2 billion in electric and natural gas rate base to support the interest coverage ratio limitation test for net earnings available for interest.\nOther\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements. Management believes the following accounting policies are particularly important to the financial statements and require the use of estimates, assumptions and judgment to describe matters that are inherently uncertain.\nRevenue Recognition\nOperating utility revenue is recognized when the basis of service is rendered, which includes estimated unbilled revenue. PSE's estimate of unbilled revenue is based on a calculation using meter readings from its automated meter reading (AMR) system. The estimate calculates unbilled usage at the end of each month as the difference between the customer meter readings on the last day of the month and the last customer meter readings billed during the month less unbilled revenues recorded in the prior month. The \"current\" month unbilled usage is then priced at published rates for each schedule to estimate the unbilled revenues by customer.\nBeginning July 1, 2013, certain revenues from PSE's electric and natural gas operations are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism under which PSE's actual energy delivery revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs are compared with authorized revenues allowed under the mechanism. The mechanism mitigates volatility in revenue due to weather and gross margin erosion related to energy efficiency. Any differences are deferred to a regulatory asset for under recovery or a regulatory liability for over recovery. Revenues associated with power costs under the PCA mechanism and PGA rates are excluded from the decoupling mechanism.\nAs defined by Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 980, Regulated Operations\u201d (ASC 980), the decoupling mechanism is an alternative revenue program that allows billings to be adjusted for the effects of weather abnormalities, conservation efforts or other various external factors. PSE adjusts these billings in the future in response to these effects to collect additional revenues provided under the decoupling mechanism. Once billing of additional revenues under the decoupling mechanism is permitted,\nthe additional revenue can be recognized when the following criteria specified by ASC 980 are met: (i) the program is established by an order from the Washington Commission that allows for automatic adjustment of future rates, (ii) the amount of additional revenues for the period is objectively determinable and is probable of recovery and (iii) the additional revenues will be collected within 24 months following the end of the annual period in which they are recognized. PSE meets the criteria to recognize revenue under the decoupling mechanism. The Company will not record any decoupling revenue that is expected to take longer than 24 months to collect following the end of the annual period in which the revenues would have otherwise been recognized. Once determined to be collectible within 24 months, any previously non-recorded amounts will be recorded.\nRegulatory Accounting\nAs a regulated entity of the Washington Commission and FERC, PSE prepares its financial statements in accordance with the provisions of ASC 980. The application of ASC 980 results in differences in the timing and recognition of certain revenue and expenses in comparison with businesses in other industries. The rates that are charged by PSE to its customers are based on cost base regulation reviewed and approved by the Washington Commission and FERC. Under the authority of these commissions, PSE has recorded certain regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2017 in the amount of $953.1 million and $1,758.6 million, respectively, and regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2016 of $1.1 billion and $653.3 million, respectively. Such amounts are amortized through a corresponding liability or asset account, respectively, with no impact to earnings. PSE expects to fully recover its regulatory assets and liabilities through its rates. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, PSE would be required to write off these regulatory assets and liabilities. In addition, if PSE determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of ASC 980, PSE could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities related to those operations not meeting ASC 980 requirements.\nAlso encompassed by regulatory accounting and subject to ASC 980 are the PCA and PGA mechanisms. The PCA and PGA mechanisms mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility upon the Company and are approved by the Washington Commission. The PCA mechanism provides for a sharing of costs that vary from baseline rates over a graduated scale. For further discussion regarding the PCA mechanism, see Item 7, \"Business - Regulation and Rates\". The increases and decreases in the cost of natural gas supply are reflected in customer bills through the PGA mechanism. PSE expects to fully recover/refund these regulatory balances through its rates. However, both mechanisms are subject to regulatory review and approval by the Washington Commission on a periodic basis.\nGoodwill\nIn 2009, Puget Holdings completed its merger with Puget Energy. Puget Energy remeasured the carrying amount of all its assets and liabilities to fair value, which resulted in recognition of approximately $1.7 billion in goodwill. ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,\u201d (ASC 350) requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the Company's business or regulatory outlook, legal factors, a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit or significant changes in the financial markets which could influence the Company's access to capital and interest rates. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units and the determination of the fair value of the reporting units. Management has determined Puget Energy has only one reporting unit.\nThe goodwill recorded by Puget Energy represents the potential long-term return to the Company's investors. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually using a qualitative and quantitative test. Management must first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances during a qualitative assessment, management determines the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the entity shall perform a quantitative test to determine impairment. This would entail a full valuation of Puget Energy's assets and liabilities and comparing the valuation to its carrying amounts, with the aggregate difference indicating the amount of impairment. Goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount.\nPuget Energy conducted its most recent annual impairment test as of October 1, 2017. The fair value of Puget Energy's reporting unit was estimated using the weighted-averages from an income valuation method, or discounted cash flow method, and a market valuation approach. These valuations required significant judgments, including: (i) estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts and other market factors, (ii) estimation of the long-term rate of growth for Puget Energy's business including other market factors, (iii) estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, (iv) the selection of utility holding companies determined to be comparable to Puget Energy, and (v) the determination of an appropriate weighted-average cost of capital or discount rate.\nManagement estimated the fair value of Puget Energy's equity to be approximately $5.5 billion at the October 1, 2017 measurement date for the annual test of goodwill impairment. The carrying value of Puget Energy's equity was approximately $3.8 billion with the excess of the fair value over the carrying value representing 44.7% or $1.7 billion.\nThe income approach and the market approach valuations resulted in Puget Energy equity values of $5.2 and $5.8 billion, respectively. The result of the income approach was very sensitive to long-term cash flow growth rates applicable to periods beyond management's five-year business plan and financial forecast period and the weighted-average cost of capital assumptions of 3.0% and 5.9%, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the results of the income valuation method, using the long-term growth rate and weighted average cost of capital:\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity Value Sensitivity Table\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in Billions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted-Average Cost of Capital Rate\n</td> <td>Long-Term Growth Rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.2%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.9\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.7\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDerivatives\nASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging\u201d (ASC 815), requires that all contracts considered to be derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value unless the contracts qualify for an exception. The Company enters into derivative contracts to manage its energy resource portfolio and interest rate exposure including forward physical and financial contracts and swaps. Some of PSE's physical electric supply contracts qualify for the normal purchase normal sale (NPNS) exception to derivative accounting rules. Generally, NPNS applies to contracts with creditworthy counterparties, for which physical delivery is probable and in quantities that will be used in the normal course of business. Power purchases designated as NPNS must meet additional criteria to determine if the transaction is within PSE's forecasted load requirements and if the counterparty owns or controls energy resources within the western region to allow for physical delivery of the energy. PSE may enter into financial fixed contracts to economically hedge the variability of certain index-based contracts. Those contracts that do not meet the NPNS exception are marked-to-market to current earnings in the statements of income. Natural gas derivative contracts qualify for deferral under ASC 980 due to the PGA mechanism.\nPuget Energy and PSE elected to de-designate all energy related derivative contracts previously recorded as cash flow hedges for the purpose of simplifying their financial reporting. The contracts that were de-designated related to physical electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts used to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation. For these contracts and contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market adjustments are recognized through earnings. The amount previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) is transferred to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings or sooner if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.\nPSE values derivative instruments based on daily quoted prices from an independent external pricing service. The Company regularly confirms the validity of pricing service quoted prices (e.g. Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) used to value commodity contracts to the actual prices of commodity contracts entered into during the most recent quarter. When external quoted market prices are not available for derivative contracts, PSE uses a valuation model that uses volatility assumptions relating to future energy prices based on specific energy markets and utilizes externally available forward market price curves. All derivative instruments are sensitive to market price fluctuations that can occur on a daily basis. The Company is focused on commodity price exposure and risks associated with volumetric variability in the natural gas and electric portfolios. PSE is not engaged in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of speculative trading. The Company economically hedges open natural gas and electric positions to reduce both the portfolio risk and the volatility risk in prices. The exposure position is determined by using a probabilistic risk system that models 250 simulations of how the Company's natural gas and power portfolios will perform under various weather, hydrological and unit performance conditions.\nThe Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial derivative instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with its long-term debt financing and debt instruments. As of December 31, 2017, the Company did not have any outstanding interest rate swap instruments.\nFor additional information, see Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\" Note 9, \"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\" and Note 10, \"Fair Value Measurements\" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.\nFair Value\nASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures\u201d (ASC 820), defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). However, as permitted under ASC 820, the Company utilizes a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point price between bid and ask prices) as a practical expedient for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value. The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable. The Company primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements as it believes that this approach is used by market participants for these types of assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. For further discussion on market risk, see Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\".\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nPSE has a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees of PSE. PSE recognized qualified pension expense of $12.1 million, $14.5 million and $22.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Of these amounts, approximately 51.6%, 55.5% and 58.5% were included in utility operations and maintenance expense in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and the remaining amounts were capitalized. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, Puget Energy recognized incremental qualified pension income of $13.4 million and $15.5 million, respectively. In 2018, it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize pension expense of $11.5 million and incremental qualified pension income of $13.0 million, respectively.\nPSE has a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP). PSE recognized pension and other postretirement benefit expenses of $4.8 million, $4.8 million and $5.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, Puget Energy recognized incremental income of $0.5 million and $0.4 million, respectively. In 2018, it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize pension expense of $5.1 million and incremental pension income of $0.5 million, respectively.\nPSE also has other limited postretirement benefit plans. PSE recognized income of $0.5 million, $0.5 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, Puget Energy recognized incremental expense of $0.2 million each year. In 2018, it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize income of $0.5 million and incremental expense of $0.2 million, respectively.\nThe Company's pension and other postretirement benefits income or expense depend on several factors and assumptions, including plan design, timing and amount of cash contributions to the plan, earnings on plan assets, discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, mortality and health care cost trends. Changes in any of these factors or assumptions will affect the amount of income or expense that the Company records in its financial statements in future years and its projected benefit obligation. The Company has selected an expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and the Company's investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors. The Company's accounting policy for calculating the market-related value of assets is based on a five-year smoothing of asset gains or losses measured from the expected return on market-related assets. This is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years. The same manner of calculating market-related value is used for all classes of assets, and is applied consistently from year to year. During 2017, the Company made cash contributions of $18.0 million to the qualified defined benefit plan. Management is closely monitoring the funding status of its qualified pension plan. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company's qualified pension plan was $3.9 million overfunded and $32.3 million underfunded as measured under GAAP, or 100.6% and 95.0% funded, respectively. As of January 1, 2018, the plan's estimated funded ratio, as calculated under guidelines from The Pension Protection Act of 2006 and considering temporary interest rate relief measures approved by Congress, was more than 100%. The aggregate expected contributions and payments by the Company to fund the pension plan, SERP and other postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2018 are expected to be at least $18.0 million, $5.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively.\nThe discount rate used in accounting for pension and other benefit obligations decreased from 4.50% in 2016 to 4.00% in 2017.

The REP credit tariff was lowered effective October 1, 2015. The REP credit is a pass-through tariff item with a corresponding credit in electric operating revenue, with no impact on net income. The Northwest Power Act, through the REP, provides access to the benefits of low-cost federal power for residential and small farm customers of regional utilities, including PSE. The program is administered by BPA. Pursuant to agreements (including settlement agreements) between BPA and PSE, BPA has provided payments of REP benefits to PSE, which PSE has passed through to its residential and small farm customers in the form of electricity bill credits. \nOn October 7, 2016, PSE filed a tariff to provide open access service to a narrow set of qualifying customers. Subsequent to that tariff filing, parties to the case reached an all-party settlement that converted the tariff to a special contract only allowing retail access for the loads of the Microsoft Corporation currently being served under PSE's electric Schedule 40. The special contract includes the following conditions: (i) Microsoft exceed Washington State's current renewable portfolio standards, (ii) the remainder of power sold to it be carbon free, (iii) there be no reduction in its funding of PSE's conservation programs, (iv) an exit fee be paid that will be a straight pass-through to customers and (v) Microsoft fund enhanced low-income support. A definitive agreement among the parties, the special contract and supportive testimony were filed with the Washington Commission on April 11, 2017 with hearings that occurred on May 3, 2017. The Washington Commission issued an order on July 13, 2017 approving PSE's special contract with Microsoft. Microsoft cannot begin taking service under the special contract until it has the required metering installed, has contracts for the supply and transmission of its power supply and pays the exit fee. PSE currently anticipates these conditions will be met in early 2019.\nThe Company's 2017 return on AMA equity was 9.0%, which is lower than the authorized regulated ROE primarily due to the following:\nWashington state law also requires PSE to pursue electric conservation that is cost-effective, reliable and feasible. PSE's mandate to pursue electric conservation initiatives may have a negative impact on the electric business financial performance due to lost margins from lower sales volumes as variable power costs are not part of the decoupling mechanism. Although not specified by Washington state law, the Washington Commission also sets natural gas conservation achievement standards for PSE. The effects of achieving these standards will, however, have only a slight negative impact on natural gas business financial performance due to the natural gas business being almost fully decoupled.\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Puget Sound Energy\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in Millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>320,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>380,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(60,527\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash items1\n</td> <td>782,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>631,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in cash flow resulting from working capital2\n</td> <td>105,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(46,554\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulatory assets and liabilities\n</td> <td>(88,875\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(152,786\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-current assets and liabilities3\n</td> <td>(32,547\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38,782\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,086,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>818,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>267,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 Natural gas retail sales revenue decreased $53.7 million due to a decrease in revenue per therm of $90.6 million, partially offset by an increase of $41.0 million in natural gas sales, due to an increase in natural gas load of 4.6% from 2015. The decrease in revenue per therm was primarily due to a rate decrease on customer bills for PGA, which decreased rates 17.4% effective November 1, 2015 partially offset by an increase in decoupling rates of 2.8% effective May 1, 2016, see Management's Discussion and Analysis, \"Regulation and Rates\" included in Item 7 of this report for natural gas rate changes. Natural gas load increased primarily due to the increase in average therms used per residential and commercial customers of 4.0% and 0.7%, respectively, compared to 2015. In addition, natural gas customers increased by 1.6% and heating degree days increased by 0.6%, which increased the natural gas heating load compared to prior year. \n 1 As of December 31, 2017, PSE had a credit facility which provides $800.0 million of short-term liquidity needs and includes a backstop to the Company's commercial paper program. The credit facility matures in October 2022. The credit facility also includes a swingline feature allowing same day availability on borrowings up to $75.0 million and an expansion feature that, upon the banks' approval, would increase the total size of the facility to $1.4 billion. As of December 31, 2017, no loans or letters of credit were outstanding under the credit facility and $329.5 million was outstanding under the commercial paper program. The credit agreement is syndicated among numerous lenders. Outside of the credit agreement, PSE has a $3.1 million letter of credit in support of a long-term transmission contract and a $1.0 million letter of credit in support of natural gas purchases in Canada. \nElectric Operating Revenue\n \u2022 Taxes other than income taxes increased $8.1 million primarily due to an increase in electric property taxes of $6.0 million based on assessed value and levy rates, electric state excise and municipal taxes of $5.8 million driven by an increase in electric revenue, partially offset by a decrease of $4.8 million in natural gas state excise and municipal taxes from a decrease in natural gas revenue.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually using a qualitative and quantitative test. Management must first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances during a qualitative assessment, management determines the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the entity shall perform a quantitative test to determine impairment. This would entail a full valuation of Puget Energy's assets and liabilities and comparing the valuation to its carrying amounts, with the aggregate difference indicating the amount of impairment. Goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount.\nASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures\u201d (ASC 820), defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). However, as permitted under ASC 820, the Company utilizes a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point price between bid and ask prices) as a practical expedient for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value. The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable. The Company primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements as it believes that this approach is used by market participants for these types of assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.

PSE meets the criteria to recognize revenue under the decoupling mechanism. The Company will not record any decoupling revenue that is expected to take longer than 24 months to collect following the end of the annual period in which the revenues would have otherwise been recognized. Once determined to be collectible within 24 months, any previously non-recorded amounts will be recorded.\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average\nPercentage\nIncrease (Decrease)\nin Rates from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total credit to be passed back to eligible customers\n(Dollars in Millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January 1, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(48.2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51.7)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(57.3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January 1, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55.2)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nFor additional information, see Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\" Note 9, \"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\" and Note 10, \"Fair Value Measurements\" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average\nPercentage\nIncrease (Decrease)\nin Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nin Revenue\n(Dollars in Millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>November 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$4.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>November 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>November 1, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K.

The Company enters into derivative contracts to manage its energy resource portfolio and interest rate exposure including forward physical and financial contracts and swaps. Some of PSE's physical electric supply contracts qualify for the normal purchase normal sale (NPNS) exception to derivative accounting rules. Generally, NPNS applies to contracts with creditworthy counterparties, for which physical delivery is probable and in quantities that will be used in the normal course of business. Power purchases designated as NPNS must meet additional criteria to determine if the transaction is within PSE's forecasted load requirements and if the counterparty owns or controls energy resources within the western region to allow for physical delivery of the energy. PSE may enter into financial fixed contracts to economically hedge the variability of certain index-based contracts. Those contracts that do not meet the NPNS exception are marked-to-market to current earnings in the statements of income. Natural gas derivative contracts qualify for deferral under ASC 980 due to the PGA mechanism.\nExisting deferrals may be included in customer rates beginning in May 2018, subject to subsequent application of the earnings test and the cap on decoupling related rate increases for natural gas customers, which was changed from 3.0% to 5.0% as a result of the Washington Commission order in PSE's GRC.\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity Value Sensitivity Table\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in Billions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted-Average Cost of Capital Rate\n</td> <td>Long-Term Growth Rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.2%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.9\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.7\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\n \u2022 Federal, state, and local taxes. \nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\n \u2022 Decoupling revenue decreased $48.6 million primarily due to an increase in use per customer, driven by an increase in heating degree days as discussed above in natural gas retail sales. This caused actual revenue to increase closer to PSE's allowed revenue, which lowered decoupled revenue in 2017. \n \u2022 Electric retail sales increased $112.5 million due an increase of $100.0 million from additional retail electricity usage of 4.2% compared to the prior year and an increase in rates of $12.5 million due to the decoupling rate mechanism. The additional usage was due to an increase of residential and commercial use per customer of 6.7% and 2.2%, respectively, an increase in heating degree days of 19.9% compared to 2016, and an increase in retail customers of 1.4%. \nGeneral Rate Case Filing\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\nEarnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Common Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Return on Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Common Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Return on Equity\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on equity\n</td> <td>$320,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$3,545,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$380,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$3,426,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less/Plus: Unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments, after-tax\n</td> <td>20,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(54,467)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less/Plus: Equity adjustments1\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>169,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>177,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Impact of average of monthly average (AMA)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on AMA equity\n</td> <td>$340,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$3,793,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$326,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$3,661,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Authorized regulated return on equity2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.8%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nElectric Margin\nThe Company's pension and other postretirement benefits income or expense depend on several factors and assumptions, including plan design, timing and amount of cash contributions to the plan, earnings on plan assets, discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, mortality and health care cost trends. Changes in any of these factors or assumptions will affect the amount of income or expense that the Company records in its financial statements in future years and its projected benefit obligation. The Company has selected an expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and the Company's investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors. The Company's accounting policy for calculating the market-related value of assets is based on a five-year smoothing of asset gains or losses measured from the expected return on market-related assets. This is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years. The same manner of calculating market-related value is used for all classes of assets, and is applied consistently from year to year. During 2017, the Company made cash contributions of $18.0 million to the qualified defined benefit plan. Management is closely monitoring the funding status of its qualified pension plan. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company's qualified pension plan was $3.9 million overfunded and $32.3 million underfunded as measured under GAAP, or 100.6% and 95.0% funded, respectively. As of January 1, 2018, the plan's estimated funded ratio, as calculated under guidelines from The Pension Protection Act of 2006 and considering temporary interest rate relief measures approved by Congress, was more than 100%. The aggregate expected contributions and payments by the Company to fund the pension plan, SERP and other postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2018 are expected to be at least $18.0 million, $5.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively.\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Puget Energy and\nPuget Sound Energy\n</td> <td>Change in Assumption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Impact on Projected\nBenefit Obligation\nIncrease /(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pension Benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SERP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other Benefits\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in discount rate\n</td> <td>50 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(38,831\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,940\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(548\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in discount rate\n</td> <td>50 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>601\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPuget Energy's net income decreased by $137.7 million, which is primarily attributable to an income tax expense increase of $79.3 million, as well as PSE's net income decrease of $60.5 million.

Included in the decoupling petition was a rate plan that allows PSE an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return without the need for another GRC process during the rate plan period. The rate plan included predetermined annual increases to PSE's allowed electric and natural gas revenue. This plan required PSE to file a GRC no later than April 1, 2016, which was later extended to January 17, 2017. The GRC was filed with the Washington Commission on January 13, 2017.\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average\nPercentage\nIncrease (Decrease)\nin Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nin Revenue\n(Dollars in Millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(1.1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 1, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.3)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 Income tax expense increased $49.4 million primarily driven by $44.0 million from higher pre-tax income and an increase of $6.5 million due to Hopkins Ridge no longer generating PTCs. PTCs are generated for the first ten years at a wind facility. As of December 2015, Hopkins Ridge is no longer eligible to generate PTCs. For additional information, see Note 13, \"Income Taxes\" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. \n\n \u2022 Other decoupling revenue decreased $4.5 million due to an increase of $16.8 million of decoupling collections as compared to 2015 from an increase in rates in 2016; partially offset by a decrease in the ROR excess earnings sharing of $13.5 million from a reduction in the ROR excess earnings accrual of $6.5 million compared to 2015 and an increase of $7.0 million in refunds to customers for the 2015 ROR excess earnings set into customer rates in 2016. The decoupling collection and refund of ROR excess earnings are driven by the tariff rates and retail sales. \nElectric power costs increased $40.1 million primarily due to a decrease of $42.6 million of residential exchange credit, an increase of $32.1 million of purchased electricity costs, partially offset by a decrease of $34.6 million of electric generation fuel expense.

This provides customers with energy choices to help them meet their sustainability goals. Incremental costs of the program will be allocated to the voluntary participants of the program as is the case with PSE's existing Green Power programs. PSE initially offered this service, Green Direct, to larger customers (aggregated annual loads greater than 10,000,000 kWh) and government customers. Approximately 136.8 MW of new wind generation facilities will be constructed in the region by a developer under contract to PSE to meet the demand for this voluntary renewable energy product project. PSE anticipates that customers will start receiving energy through this program in 2019.\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

maintenance expense primarily related to natural gas leak repairs and sewer cross bore inspections, maintenance on gearboxes and generators at the Hopkins Ridge and Wild Horse wind generation facilities, electric distribution maintenance for overhead lines and vegetation management; (ii) an increase of outside services expense of $7.4 million primarily related to customer service initiatives; (iii) an increase of salary expense of $2.9 million primarily related to incentive increases; partially offset by (iv) a decrease of $4.6 million in meter reading expense due to the purchase of previously leased meter reading equipment during 2015. \nPSE's operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. These regulations cover electric system reliability, natural gas pipeline system safety and energy market transparency, among other areas. Environmental laws and regulations related to air and water quality, including climate change and endangered species protection, waste handling and disposal (including generation by-products such as coal ash), remediation of contamination and siting new facilities also impact the Company's operations. PSE must spend a significant amount of resources to fulfill requirements set by regulatory agencies, many of which have greatly expanded mandates on measures including resource planning, remediation, monitoring, pollution control equipment and emissions-related abatement and fees.\n 1 Equity adjustments are related to removing the impacts of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), subsidiary retained earnings, retained earnings of derivative instruments, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve. \n\nThe following table presents PSE's ROE, its return on AMA equity and its authorized regulated ROE for 2017 and 2016:\n \u2022 Approximately $535.0 million of additional first mortgage bonds under PSE's natural gas mortgage indenture based on approximately $891.7 million of natural gas bondable property available for issuance, subject to a combined natural gas and electric interest coverage test of 1.75 times net earnings available for interest and a natural gas interest coverage test of 2.0 times net earnings available for interest (as defined in the natural gas utility mortgage), both of which PSE exceeded at December 31, 2017  At December 31, 2017, PSE had approximately $7.2 billion in electric and natural gas rate base to support the interest coverage ratio limitation test for net earnings available for interest.\n \u2022 Non-utility and other expense increased $14.5 million primarily due to an increase in the long-term incentive plan of $12.3 million in 2017 which resulted from a total return in 2017 of 29.1% which resulted in the total return component to be funded at 200.0%. For more information see Part III, \"Executive Compensation\" included in Item 11 of this report for the Company's long term incentive plan. \nOther\nThe PCA settlement also resulted in the following changes to the PCA mechanism:\n 2 The authorized regulated return on equity rate changed to 9.5% effective December 19, 2017, per the approved GRC. \nThe following table sets forth residential exchange benefit adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding expected annual impact on PSE's revenue based on the effective dates:\n_______________\n \u2022 Net unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments expense increased $114.6 million to a net loss of $30.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The primary drivers for the increase consist of a reduction of $20.6 million in gains from contract settlements previously recorded as losses that settled to purchased electricity or electric generation fuel and a $94.0 million loss due to a decrease in natural gas and electricity forward prices of 26.9% and 27.5%, respectively. The $20.6 million reduction from contract settlements was comprised of a $16.5 million from natural gas and a $4.1 million from wholesale electric contracts. The decrease in the weighted average natural gas and wholesale electric forward prices resulted in a $78.4 million loss and a $15.6 million loss, respectively. \n \u2022 Transportation and other revenue increased $92.5 million primarily due to a change in production tax credit (PTC) deferral revenue of $73.2 million due to a $19.9 million reduction to revenue in 2016 as PTCs were generated compared to no PTC generated in 2017, as well as, a $51.2 million remeasurement of the PTC deferral in 2017 due to tax law change. Additionally, there was an increase in net wholesale natural gas sales of $17.5 million due to increased purchased electricity, as discussed below. \nThe following table sets forth CRM rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE's revenue based on the effective dates:\nThe Company's external financing requirements principally reflect the cash needs of its construction program, its schedule of maturing debt and certain operational needs. The Company anticipates refinancing the redemption of bonds or other long-term borrowings with its credit facilities and/or the issuance of new long-term debt. Access to funds depends upon factors such as Puget Energy's and PSE's credit ratings, prevailing interest rates and investor receptivity to investing in the utility industry, Puget Energy and PSE. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity through its credit facilities and access to capital markets to fund its needs over the next twelve months.\nThe following table sets forth PGA rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE's revenue based on the effective dates:\nNatural Gas Margin\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, other than the items disclosed in Note 8, \"Leases\" and in Note 15, \"Commitment and Contingencies\" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 2 of this report.\n\nThe rates that PSE is allowed to charge for its services influence its financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. PSE is highly regulated and the rates that it charges its retail customers are approved by the Washington Commission. The Washington Commission has traditionally required these rates be determined based, to a large extent, on historic test year costs plus weather normalized assumptions about hydroelectric conditions and power costs in the relevant rate year. Incremental customer growth and sales typically have not provided sufficient revenue to cover general cost increases over time due to the combined effects of regulatory lag and attrition. In addition, the Washington Commission determines whether the Company's expenses and capital investments are reasonable and prudent for the provision of cost effective, reliable and safe electric and natural gas service. If the Washington Commission determines that an operating expense or capital investment does not meet the reasonable and prudent standards, the costs (including return on any resulting rate base) related to such operating expense or capital investment may be disallowed, partially or entirely, and not recovered in rates.\n\nAccess to Debt Capital\n\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\n 1 Non-cash items include depreciation, amortization, deferred income taxes, net unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments, AFUDC-equity, production tax credits and other miscellaneous non-cash items. \nNatural Gas Energy Costs\nIn 2009, Puget Holdings completed its merger with Puget Energy. Puget Energy remeasured the carrying amount of all its assets and liabilities to fair value, which resulted in recognition of approximately $1.7 billion in goodwill. ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,\u201d (ASC 350) requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the Company's business or regulatory outlook, legal factors, a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit or significant changes in the financial markets which could influence the Company's access to capital and interest rates. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units and the determination of the fair value of the reporting units. Management has determined Puget Energy has only one reporting unit.\nOther Operating Expenses\nThe following are PSE's and Puget Energy's aggregate contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nThe following table sets forth property tax tracker mechanism rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE's revenue based on the effective dates:\nPSE relies on access to bank borrowings and short-term money markets as sources of liquidity and longer-term capital markets to fund its utility construction program, to meet maturing debt obligations and other capital expenditure requirements not satisfied by cash flow from its operations or equity investment from its parent, Puget Energy. Neither Puget Energy nor PSE have any debt outstanding whose maturity would accelerate upon a credit rating downgrade. However, a ratings downgrade could adversely affect the Company's ability to renew existing, or obtain access to new credit facilities and could increase the cost of such facilities. For example, under Puget Energy's and PSE's credit facilities, the borrowing costs increase as their respective credit ratings decline due to increases in credit spreads and commitment fees. If PSE is unable to access debt capital on reasonable terms, its ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions, including generating capacity, which may be relied on for future growth and to otherwise implement its strategy, could be adversely affected. PSE monitors the credit environment and expects to continue to be able to access the capital markets to meet its short-term and long-term borrowing needs. In October 2017, PSE and Puget Energy each entered into new 5-year credit facilities that replaced the previous facilities and are scheduled to mature in October 2022. For additional information on credit facilities, see Note 7, Liquidity Facilities and Other Financing Arrangements\" included in Item 8 of this report.\n \u2022 Other decoupling revenue decreased $2.7 million due to an increase in decoupling deferral collection of $17.9 million, as a result of an additional $17.3 million being set in rates on May 1, 2016, which was partially offset by a decrease in ROR excess earnings sharing accrual of $12.5 million and an increase in ROR excess earnings refund in 2016 of $2.5 million. The decoupling collection and refund of ROR excess earnings are driven by the tariff rates and customer usage. \nPurchased Gas Adjustment\n_______________\n \u2022 Residential exchange credits increased $6.1 million resulting from higher Residential Exchange Program (REP) credits associated with the BPA REP settlement due to the REP credit tariff increase in 2017 and increased usage. The REP credit is a pass-through tariff item with a corresponding credit in electric operating revenue, with no impact on net income. The Northwest Power Act, through the REP, provides access to the benefits of low-cost federal power for residential and small farm customers of regional utilities, including PSE. The program is administered by BPA. Pursuant to agreements (including settlement agreements) between BPA and PSE, BPA has provided payments of REP benefits to PSE, which PSE has passed through to its residential and small farm customers in the form of electricity bill credits. \nElectric Power Costs\nNatural gas operating revenue decreased $57.0 million primarily due to lower natural gas retail sales revenue of $53.7 million and a decrease in other decoupling revenue of $2.7 million, see discussion below.\nThe following chart displays the changes in PSE's natural gas margin from 2015 to 2016:\nElectric power costs increased $43.2 million primarily due to an increase of $58.4 million of purchased electricity costs, partially offset by a decrease of $9.1 million of electric generation fuel expense and an increase of $6.1 million of residential exchange credits. These items are discussed in detail below:\n\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016\nElectric operating revenues increased $110.0 million primarily due to higher retail sales of $81.1 million, increased decoupling revenue of $16.3 million and transportation and other revenue of $13.6 million. These items are discussed in detail below:\n2015 compared to 2016\n \u2022 Electric generation fuel expense decreased $9.1 million primarily due to a $2.7 million reduction in combustion turbine generation costs as a result of a 7.9% reduction in combustion turbine generation due to favorable wholesale electricity prices and a $6.3 million decrease in coal generation costs primarily at Colstrip units 3 and 4 for variable fuel costs due to less coal delivered and burned in 2017. \n\n \u2022 Purchased electricity expense increased $58.4 million primarily due to an 11.2% increase in wholesale electricity purchases, partially offset by a 0.2% decrease in prices. The increase in purchases was primarily driven by an increase in load and lower wholesale electricity prices on the open market compared to generating power. Additionally, a decrease of hydro and wind production of 7.4% and 14.7%, increased the need to purchase additional wholesale power. \nElectric Rates\n\nThe type and amount of future long-term financings for PSE may be limited by provisions in PSE's electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.\nNatural Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism\nThe following chart displays the changes in PSE's electric margin from 2016 to 2017:\nFactors and Trends Affecting PSE's Performance\nThe following chart displays the changes in PSE's electric margin from 2015 to 2016:\nSubstantially all the operations of Puget Energy are conducted through its regulated subsidiary, PSE. Puget Energy's results of operation for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nFair Value\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, in its PCA mechanism, PSE under recovered its power costs by $11.5 million of which no amount was apportioned to customers. This compares to an under recovery of power costs of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 of which no amounts were apportioned to customers. Although load increased in 2017 compared to 2016, that increase was offset by a decrease in the total baseline rate and an increase in costs. Additionally, the year over year variance was due to the 2017 mechanism changes where fixed production costs, other costs and adjustments are no longer included. The mechanism is now comparing variable PCA costs using the variable costs portion of the baseline rate. The fixed costs became part of the decoupling mechanism, effective December 19, 2017 as a result of the GRC but until then the revenue variance associated with the fixed production costs are being deferred using the fixed cost portion of the baseline rate. The revenue variance associated with the fixed production costs was deferred using the fixed cost portion of the baseline rate until December 19, 2017, when the fixed costs became part of the decoupling mechanism with the resolution of PSE's GRC.\nNatural gas operating revenue increased $107.3 million primarily due to higher retail sales of $148.1 million and increased other decoupling revenue of $5.9 million; partially offset by a decrease in decoupling revenue of $48.6 million. These items are discussed in the following details:\nVoluntary Long-Term Renewable Energy\nOverview\nCapital Requirements\nOther Proceedings\nBeginning July 1, 2013, certain revenues from PSE's electric and natural gas operations are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism under which PSE's actual energy delivery revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs are compared with authorized revenues allowed under the mechanism. The mechanism mitigates volatility in revenue due to weather and gross margin erosion related to energy efficiency. Any differences are deferred to a regulatory asset for under recovery or a regulatory liability for over recovery. Revenues associated with power costs under the PCA mechanism and PGA rates are excluded from the decoupling mechanism.\nRegulatory Compliance Costs and Expenditures\nRevenue Recognition\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n2016 compared to 2017\n2015 compared to 2016\n \u2022 Income Tax Expense increased by $79.3 million primarily due to tax reform passed on December 22, 2017 that lowered the corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%. As a result, income tax expense was effected by the revaluation of Puget Energy's deferred tax assets at the 21.0% rate. \n2016 compared to 2017\nProceeds from PSE's short-term borrowings and sales of commercial paper are used to provide working capital and the interim funding of utility construction programs. Puget Energy and PSE continue to have reasonable access to the capital and credit markets.\n_______________\nLarge Customer Retail Wheeling\n \u2022 Partially offsetting the above was net revenue from below the line activities and interest savings which totaled $28.2 million for an impact on ROE of positive 0.7%. \n \u2022 Taxes other than income taxes increased $32.0 million primarily due to increases in municipal taxes of $11.5 million and state excise taxes of $10.2 million as a result of an increase in revenue and an increase of $9.3 million in property taxes related to increased property values and expected levy rates. \n\n \u2022 Regulatory assets and liabilities cash flow increased $63.9 million primarily due to changes in decoupling and derivatives offset by changes in purchased gas adjustments. \n * Not meaningful and/or applicable. \nPSE's electric and natural gas utility retail customers generally do not have the ability to choose their electric or natural gas supplier; and therefore, PSE's business has historically been recognized as a natural monopoly. However, PSE faces competition from public utility districts and municipalities that want to establish their own municipal-owned utility, as a result of which PSE may lose a number of customers. Further, PSE faces increasing competition for sales to its retail customers. Alternative methods of electric energy generation, including solar and other self-generation methods, compete with PSE for sales to existing electric retail customers. In addition, PSE's natural gas customers may elect to use heating oil, propane or other fuels instead of using and purchasing natural gas from PSE.\nOther Operating Expenses and Other Income (Deductions)\n\n \u2022 Rates are based on an assumption of normal weather. The amount of variance due to weather was $13.2 million, which resulted in an impact on ROE of positive 0.3%. \nCapital Resources\n\nPuget Energy\nUtility Construction Program\nElectric operating revenues increased $182.2 million primarily due to higher retail sales of $112.5 million, increased transportation and other revenue of $92.5 million, partially offset by decreased decoupling revenue of $20.0 million and other decoupling revenue of $6.5 million. These items are discussed in detail below:\nFor information on Puget Energy and PSE dividends, long-term debt and credit facilities, see Note 4, Dividend Payment Restrictions, Note 6, Long-term Debt\u201d and Note 7, Liquidity Facilities and Other Financing Arrangements\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.\nElectric Conservation Rider\nThe program is subject to change based upon general business, economic and regulatory conditions. Utility construction expenditures and any new generation resource expenditures are typically funded from a combination of cash from operations, short-term debt, long-term debt and/or equity. PSE's utility construction program expenditures periodically can and do exceed cash flow generated from operations. As a result, execution of PSE's utility construction program is dependent, in part, on continued access to capital markets.\n 3 For additional information, see Note 8, \"Leases\" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. \nGoodwill\n \u2022 Regulated equity (rate base time's equity percent) was $478.0 million lower than AMA equity for the year ended December 31, 2017. The variance was primarily driven by the impact on rate base of the deferred tax liability for utility, plant and equipment. The impact on ROE for this variance was negative 1.2%. \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements. Management believes the following accounting policies are particularly important to the financial statements and require the use of estimates, assumptions and judgment to describe matters that are inherently uncertain.\n \u2022 General economic conditions in PSE's service territory and its effects on customer growth and use-per-customer; and \nCash generated from operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $242.8 million compared to the same period in 2016. The net difference was primarily impacted by the increase from cash flow provided by the operating activities of PSE, as previously discussed. The remaining variance is explained below:\n_______________\n \u2022 Other decoupling revenue increased $5.9 million due to the following: (i) an increase in decoupling collections of $14.7 million from an increase in the amortization rate in 2017 and an increase in therms used; (ii) in 2017, there was $19.6 million of deferred decoupling revenue that was recognized as it met the alternative revenue program revenue recognition criteria that it is expected to be collected from customers within 24 months, compared to the 24-month reserve of $9.6 million in 2016; and (iii) an increase in net overearnings accruals and cash refunds of $8.6 million. \n\n \u2022 Non-utility expense and other increased $5.1 million primarily due to legal outside services of $2.8 million and qualified pension expense of $1.2 million. \nThe following table sets forth PCORC and update compliance filing rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE's revenue based on the effective dates:\nPSE generates revenue and cash flow primarily from the sale of electric and natural gas services to residential and commercial customers within a service territory covering approximately 6,000 square miles, principally in the Puget Sound region of the state of Washington. PSE continually balances its load requirements, generation resources, purchase power agreements, and market purchases to meet customer demand. The Company's external financing requirements principally reflect the cash needs of its construction program, its schedule of maturing debt and certain operational needs. PSE requires access to bank and capital markets to meet its financing needs.\n 1 Energy purchase contracts were entered into as part of PSE's obligation to serve retail electric and natural gas customers' energy requirements. As a result, costs are generally recovered either through base retail rates or adjustments to retail rates as part of the power and natural gas cost adjustment mechanisms. \nAlso encompassed by regulatory accounting and subject to ASC 980 are the PCA and PGA mechanisms. The PCA and PGA mechanisms mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility upon the Company and are approved by the Washington Commission. The PCA mechanism provides for a sharing of costs that vary from baseline rates over a graduated scale. For further discussion regarding the PCA mechanism, see Item 7, \"Business - Regulation and Rates\". The increases and decreases in the cost of natural gas supply are reflected in customer bills through the PGA mechanism. PSE expects to fully recover/refund these regulatory balances through its rates. However, both mechanisms are subject to regulatory review and approval by the Washington Commission on a periodic basis.\nElectric Property Tax Tracker Mechanism\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nOn September 30, 2016, PSE filed an accounting petition with the Washington Commission, which requested deferral of the variances, either positive or negative, between the fixed costs previously recovered in the PCA and the revenue received to cover the allowed fixed costs. The deferral period requested was January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, when rates went into effect from PSE's 2017 GRC. On November 10, 2016, the Washington Commission issued Order No. 01 approving PSE's accounting petition. With the final determination in PSE's GRC, this deferral ceased with the rate effective date of December 19, 2017.\n 2 For individual long-term debt maturities, see Note 6, \"Long-Term Debt,\" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. For Puget Energy, the amount above excludes the fair value adjustments related to the merger. \n \u2022 Other non-current assets and liabilities cash flow decreased $38.8 million primarily due to an increase in the long-term incentive plan accrual, an increase in major maintenance and inspections, reduced pension funding and other changes in long-term assets and liabilities. \n \u2022 PSE's ability to supply electricity and natural gas, either through company-owned generation, purchase power contracts or by procuring natural gas or electricity in wholesale markets; \n 2 Changes in working capital include receivables, unbilled revenue, materials/supplies, fuel/gas inventory, income taxes, prepayments, purchased gas adjustments, accounts payable and accrued expenses. \n \u2022 Non-cash items increased $151.5 million primarily due to changes in derivative instruments of $114.6 million, depreciation and amortization of $42.4 million, deferred taxes of $36.1 million and conservation amortization of $13.4 million offset by a decrease of $53.3 million in production tax credits. For further discussion, see Other Operating Expenses in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis and Note 13, \"Income Taxes\" in Item 8. \n \u2022 Agreement, for a five-year period, that PSE will not file a GRC or PCORC within six months of the date rates go into effect for a PCORC filing; and \nResidential Exchange Benefit\nPuget Energy and PSE elected to de-designate all energy related derivative contracts previously recorded as cash flow hedges for the purpose of simplifying their financial reporting. The contracts that were de-designated related to physical electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts used to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation. For these contracts and contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market adjustments are recognized through earnings. The amount previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) is transferred to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings or sooner if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.\n \u2022 Interest expense decreased $6.3 million primarily due to a reduction of $3.8 million in interest on long-term debt related to debt that was refinanced in May 2015 at an interest rate of 4.30% compared to interest rates of 5.197% and 6.75%; and an increase of $1.7 million related to allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) debt due to an increase in average construction work in progress (CWIP). \nFactors affecting PSE's performance are set forth in this Overview\u201d section, as well as in other sections of the Management's Discussion and Analysis.\n * Includes decoupling cash collections, rate of return excess earnings, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve. \n \u2022 Regulatory compliance costs, including those related to new and developing federal regulations of electric system reliability, state regulations of natural gas pipelines and federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations; \nPower Cost Only Rate Case and Update Compliance Filing\n2016 compared to 2017\n \u2022 Electric generation fuel expense decreased $34.6 million primarily due to a $43.0 million reduction in combustion turbine costs as a result of a 28.8% reduction in combustion turbine generation due to favorable wholesale electricity prices and increased wind and hydro generation. This was partially offset by an $8.4 million increase in coal generation costs primarily due to an increase in the weighted-average cost of coal. \nCash generated from operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $267.9 million including a net income decrease of $60.5 million. The following are significant factors that impacted PSE's cash flows from operations:\nDerivatives\nNatural Gas Energy Costs\n \u2022 Transportation and other revenue increased $13.6 million primarily due to a reduction of amortization of PTC deferral credits of $10.1 million since PTC generation at Hopkins Ridge ended in 2015 and increase in net wholesale natural gas sales of $6.8 million. \n\n2015 compared to 2016\n_______________\n \u2022 PSE's ability to recover power costs that are included in rates, which are based on volume; \n 2 Changes in working capital include receivables, unbilled revenue, materials/supplies, fuel/gas inventory, income taxes, prepayments, purchased gas adjustments, accounts payable and accrued expenses. \n* Includes decoupling cash collections, rate of return excess earnings, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve.\nPSE has a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP). PSE recognized pension and other postretirement benefit expenses of $4.8 million, $4.8 million and $5.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, Puget Energy recognized incremental income of $0.5 million and $0.4 million, respectively. In 2018, it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize pension expense of $5.1 million and incremental pension income of $0.5 million, respectively.\nElectric Operating Revenue\nOperating utility revenue is recognized when the basis of service is rendered, which includes estimated unbilled revenue. PSE's estimate of unbilled revenue is based on a calculation using meter readings from its automated meter reading (AMR) system. The estimate calculates unbilled usage at the end of each month as the difference between the customer meter readings on the last day of the month and the last customer meter readings billed during the month less unbilled revenues recorded in the prior month. The \"current\" month unbilled usage is then priced at published rates for each schedule to estimate the unbilled revenues by customer.\nThe Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial derivative instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with its long-term debt financing and debt instruments. As of December 31, 2017, the Company did not have any outstanding interest rate swap instruments.\n \u2022 Increasing capital expenditures with additional depreciation and amortization; \nThe following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), as well as return on equity (ROE) excluding unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments (net income plus unrealized losses and/or minus unrealized gains on derivative instruments divided by average common equity) that is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.\u201d Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that includes adjustments that result in a departure from GAAP presentation. The Company believes that return on average of monthly averages (AMA) equity, also a non-GAAP measure, is a more suitable metric for comparing ROE across years and is a more accurate metric for assessing and evaluating ROE performance against the Company's authorized regulated ROE. The AMA equity is not intended to represent the regulated equity. PSE's ROE may not be comparable to other companies' ROE measures. Furthermore, this measure is not intended to replace ROE (GAAP net income divided by GAAP average common equity) as an indicator of operating performance.\n \u2022 Establishment of a five-year moratorium on changes to the PCA. \nPSE values derivative instruments based on daily quoted prices from an independent external pricing service. The Company regularly confirms the validity of pricing service quoted prices (e.g. Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) used to value commodity contracts to the actual prices of commodity contracts entered into during the most recent quarter. When external quoted market prices are not available for derivative contracts, PSE uses a valuation model that uses volatility assumptions relating to future energy prices based on specific energy markets and utilizes externally available forward market price curves. All derivative instruments are sensitive to market price fluctuations that can occur on a daily basis. The Company is focused on commodity price exposure and risks associated with volumetric variability in the natural gas and electric portfolios. PSE is not engaged in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of speculative trading. The Company economically hedges open natural gas and electric positions to reduce both the portfolio risk and the volatility risk in prices. The exposure position is determined by using a probabilistic risk system that models 250 simulations of how the Company's natural gas and power portfolios will perform under various weather, hydrological and unit performance conditions.\nElectric margin represents electric sales to retail and transportation customers less the cost of generating and purchasing electric energy sold to customers, including transmission costs to bring electric energy to PSE's service territory.\n\nPSE's ongoing regulatory requirements and operational needs necessitated the investment of substantial capital in 2017 and will continue to do so in future years. Because PSE intends to seek recovery of such investments through the regulatory process, its financial results depend heavily upon favorable outcomes from that process. The principal business, economic and other factors that affect PSE's operations and financial performance include:\n \u2022 The rates PSE is allowed to charge for its services; \nThe following table sets forth Federal Incentive Tracker Tariff rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE's revenue based on the effective dates:\nIn 2013, the Washington Commission issued final orders resolving the amended decoupling petition, the ERF filing and the Petition for Reconsideration (related to the TransAlta Centralia power purchase agreement). Order No. 7 in the ERF/decoupling proceeding approved PSE's ERF filing with a small change to its cost of capital to 7.77% which updated long-term debt costs and a capital structure that included 48.0% common equity with a return on equity (ROE) of 9.8%. This order also approved the property tax tracker discussed below and approved the amended decoupling and rate plan filing with the further condition that PSE will share 50.0% of any earnings in excess of the 7.77% authorized rate of return with customers. In addition, the K-Factor (rate plan) increase allowed decoupling revenue per customer for the recovery of delivery system costs to subsequently increase by 3.0% per year for electric customers and 2.2% per year for natural gas customers on January 1 of each year, until the effective date of new rates in PSE's General Rate Case (GRC). The new rates became effective December 19, 2017, as discussed below. In the decoupling mechanism, increases were subject to a cap of 3.0% of the total revenue for customers.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this document. The following discussion provides the significant items that impacted PSE's results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nDebt Restrictive Covenants\nThe following table sets forth conservation rider rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding annual impact on PSE's revenue based on the effective dates:\nPower Cost Adjustment Mechanism\nThe residential exchange program passes through the residential exchange program benefits that PSE will be receiving from the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) between October 1, 2017 and September 30, 2019. Rates change bi-annually on October 1.\n_______________\n \u2022 Suspension of the requirement that a GRC must be filed within three months after rates are approved in a PCORC; \nThe following chart displays the details of PSE's other operating expenses and other income (deductions) from period 2015 to 2016:\nAs noted earlier, at the time of the filings below, the Company was also limited to a 3.0% annual decoupling related cap on increases in total revenue. This limitation has been triggered as follows:\n \u2022 Depreciation expense was $24.8 million higher than the amount allowed in rates for the year ended December 31, 2017 for an impact on ROE of negative 0.7%. \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization expense increased $15.7 million primarily due to $16.5 million of depreciation expense primarily due to net additions of $173.9 million of natural gas distribution assets, $148.5 million of electric distribution assets and $90.6 million of electric transmission assets. \nAs defined by Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 980, Regulated Operations\u201d (ASC 980), the decoupling mechanism is an alternative revenue program that allows billings to be adjusted for the effects of weather abnormalities, conservation efforts or other various external factors. PSE adjusts these billings in the future in response to these effects to collect additional revenues provided under the decoupling mechanism. Once billing of additional revenues under the decoupling mechanism is permitted,\n \u2022 Removal of fixed production costs from the PCA mechanism and placing them in the decoupling mechanism. Inclusion of these costs in the decoupling mechanism was subsequently approved in the GRC. These fixed production costs include: (i) return and depreciation/amortization on fixed production assets and regulatory assets and liabilities; (ii) return, depreciation, transmission expense and revenues on specific transmission assets; and (iii) hydroelectric, other production and other power related expenses and O&M costs; \nOn August 7, 2015, the Washington Commission issued an order approving the changes to the PCA mechanism. The settlement agreement took effect January 1, 2017 and will apply the following graduated scale:\nPSE has a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees of PSE. PSE recognized qualified pension expense of $12.1 million, $14.5 million and $22.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Of these amounts, approximately 51.6%, 55.5% and 58.5% were included in utility operations and maintenance expense in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and the remaining amounts were capitalized. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, Puget Energy recognized incremental qualified pension income of $13.4 million and $15.5 million, respectively. In 2018, it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize pension expense of $11.5 million and incremental qualified pension income of $13.0 million, respectively.\n \u2022 Regulated equity (rate base time's equity percent) was $360.0 million lower than AMA equity for the year ended December 31, 2016. The variance was primarily driven by the impact on rate base of the deferred tax liability for utility, plant and equipment. The impact on ROE for this variance was negative 1.0%. \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n_______________\n \u2022 Regulatory decisions allowing PSE to recover purchased power and fuel costs, on a timely basis; \nFor the discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements, see Note 2, \"New Accounting Pronouncements\" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.\n 3 As of December 31, 2017, Puget Energy had a revolving senior secured credit facility totaling $800.0 million, which matures in October 2022. The revolving senior secured credit facility is syndicated among numerous lenders. The revolving senior secured credit facility also has an expansion feature that, upon the banks' approval, would increase the size of the facility to $1.3 billion. As of December 31, 2017, there was $102.6 million drawn and outstanding under the Puget Energy credit facility. \nNatural Gas Property Tax Tracker Mechanism\n \u2022 Decoupling revenue decreased $20.0 million due to a decrease in decoupling deferrals of $23.5 million driven by actual revenue being closer to PSE's allowed revenue per the decoupling mechanism compared to 2016. The increase in actual revenue was due to an increase in load as discussed above in electric retail sales. This was partially offset by an increase in decoupling revenue of $3.5 million due to fixed production cost deferrals, which were removed from the PCA mechanism and placed into the decoupling mechanism effective January 1, 2017. \nAs a regulated entity of the Washington Commission and FERC, PSE prepares its financial statements in accordance with the provisions of ASC 980. The application of ASC 980 results in differences in the timing and recognition of certain revenue and expenses in comparison with businesses in other industries. The rates that are charged by PSE to its customers are based on cost base regulation reviewed and approved by the Washington Commission and FERC. Under the authority of these commissions, PSE has recorded certain regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2017 in the amount of $953.1 million and $1,758.6 million, respectively, and regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2016 of $1.1 billion and $653.3 million, respectively. Such amounts are amortized through a corresponding liability or asset account, respectively, with no impact to earnings. PSE expects to fully recover its regulatory assets and liabilities through its rates. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, PSE would be required to write off these regulatory assets and liabilities. In addition, if PSE determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of ASC 980, PSE could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities related to those operations not meeting ASC 980 requirements.\nDuring 2013, PSE completed an expedited rate filing (ERF), which was a limited scope rate proceeding, and established a decoupling mechanism for natural gas operations and electric transmission, distribution and administrative costs. The ERF proceeding established baseline rates on which the decoupling mechanism will operate during the rate plan period. The ERF also established a property tax tracker mechanism in which any difference between amounts in rates and property tax payments will be deferred and recovered in an annual filing based on the actual cash payments for the year.\nRegulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs\n2013 Expedited Rate Filing and Decoupling Decision\n 2 As of December 31, 2017, PSE had a revolving credit facility with Puget Energy in the form of a promissory note to borrow up to $30.0 million. \n 1 Non-cash items include depreciation, amortization, deferred income taxes, net unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments, AFUDC-equity, production tax credits and miscellaneous non-cash items. \n \u2022 Partially offsetting the above was net revenue from below the line activities which totaled $4.3 million. \nNatural Gas Rates\n \u2022 Weather conditions, including the impact of temperature on customer load; the impact of extreme weather events on budgeted maintenance costs; meteorological conditions such as snow-pack, stream-flow and wind-speed which affect power generation, supply and price; \n2016 compared to 2017\nThe discount rate used in accounting for pension and other benefit obligations decreased from 4.50% in 2016 to 4.00% in 2017. The discount rate used in accounting for pension and other benefit expense decreased from 4.65% in 2016 to 4.50% in 2017. The rate of return on plan assets for qualified pension benefits decreased from 7.75% in 2016 to 7.45% in 2017. The rate of return on plan assets for other benefits in 2017 and 2016 was 6.75%, respectively.\n\nPSE currently has a PCA mechanism that provides for the deferral of power costs that vary from the power cost baseline\u201d level of power costs. The power cost baseline\u201d levels are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydrological conditions. Excess power costs or savings are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism and will trigger a surcharge or refund when the cumulative deferral trigger is reached.\n \u2022 Income tax expense increased $36.6 million primarily driven by the impact of tax reform on the deferred tax balances and partially offset by a 4.3% decrease in pre-tax income. For additional information, see Note 13, \"Income Taxes\" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. \nCompliance with these or other future regulations, such as those pertaining to climate change, could require significant capital expenditures by PSE and may adversely affect PSE's financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nCash from Operations\n \u2022 Tax reform, the effect of lower tax rates, and regulatory treatment of excess deferred tax balances on rate base and customer rates; \nResults of Operations\nPurchased natural gas expense decreased $89.4 million primarily due to lower natural gas costs included in PGA rates effective November 1, 2015, which was partially offset by an increase in natural gas usage of 4.6%.\nPSE's construction programs for generating facilities, the electric transmission system, the natural gas and electric distribution systems and the Tacoma LNG facility are designed to meet regulatory requirements and customer growth and to support reliable energy delivery. Construction expenditures, excluding equity AFUDC, totaled $963.7 million in 2017. Presently planned utility construction expenditures, excluding equity AFUDC, are as follows:\n \u2022 Changes in cash flow resulting from working capital increased $151.8 million primarily due to changes in accounts receivable and unbilled revenue of $50.7 million, an increase to the purchased gas adjustment of $34.2 million as discussed previously in the electric and natural gas margin discussion, an increase of $27.5 million in materials and supplies, and an increase of $47.0 million in prepayments. \n \u2022 Availability and access to capital and the cost of capital; \n\n \u2022 Changes in cash flow resulting from working capital decreased $33.2 million primarily due to amounts owed to PSE related to Puget LNG. \n_______________\n 1 The increase in revenue is net of reductions from excess earnings of $11.9 million for electric and $2.2 million for natural gas effective May1, 2017, and $11.9 million for electric and $5.5 million for natural gas effective May 1, 2016. \nDecoupling Filings\nPuget Energy conducted its most recent annual impairment test as of October 1, 2017. The fair value of Puget Energy's reporting unit was estimated using the weighted-averages from an income valuation method, or discounted cash flow method, and a market valuation approach. These valuations required significant judgments, including: (i) estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts and other market factors, (ii) estimation of the long-term rate of growth for Puget Energy's business including other market factors, (iii) estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, (iv) the selection of utility holding companies determined to be comparable to Puget Energy, and (v) the determination of an appropriate weighted-average cost of capital or discount rate.\n \u2022 Purchased electricity expense increased $32.1 million primarily due to a 16.1% increase in wholesale electricity purchases, partially offset by a 8.3% decrease in wholesale electricity prices. The increase in purchases was primarily driven by an increase in load and lower wholesale electricity prices on the open market compared to generating power. Additionally, an increase of hydro and wind production of 32.2% and 14.4% decreased the need to purchase additional wholesale power due to favorable conditions. \nThe graduated scale that was applicable through December 31, 2016 was as follows:\nFinancing Program\nOn January 13, 2017, PSE filed its GRC with the Washington Commission the settlement agreement was accepted by the Washington Commission on December 5, 2017 and the rates became effective December 19, 2017. For further details regarding the 2017 GRC filing, see Note 3, \"Regulation and Rates\" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.\nFor additional information, see Business, \"Regulation and Rates\" included in Item 1 of this report.\nPurchased natural gas expense increased $46.1 million due to an increase in natural gas costs included in PGA rates effective November 1, 2016 as compared to those effective November 1, 2015, and an increase in natural gas usage of 18.0%.\nPuget Energy is an energy services holding company and substantially all of its operations are conducted through its subsidiary PSE, a regulated electric and natural gas utility company. PSE is the largest electric and natural gas utility in the state of Washington, primarily engaged in the business of electric transmission, distribution and generation and natural gas distribution. Puget Energy's business strategy is to generate stable cash flows by offering reliable electric and natural gas service in a cost-effective manner through PSE. Puget Energy also has a wholly-owned non-regulated subsidiary, Puget LNG, LLC (Puget LNG). Puget LNG was formed on November 29, 2016, and has the sole purpose of owning, developing and financing the non-regulated activity of the Tacoma LNG facility, currently under construction. All of Puget Energy's common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings, LLC (Puget Holdings). Puget Holdings is owned by a consortium of long-term infrastructure investors including Macquarie Infrastructure Partners, Macquarie Capital Group Limited, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation, and the Alberta Investment Management Corporation. Puget Energy and PSE are collectively referred to herein as the Company.\u201d\n \u2022 Decoupling revenue increased $16.3 million due to actual revenues were lower than PSE's allowed revenue per the decoupling mechanism compared to 2015. This increase was primarily from residential and commercial decoupled rate schedules, which increased $15.6 million in 2016. The increase was driven from an increase in customers which increases the allowed revenue and a decrease in use per customer, which lowers the actual revenue resulting in higher decoupled revenue. \nNatural gas margin is natural gas sales to retail and transportation customers less the cost of natural gas purchased, including transportation costs to bring natural gas to PSE's service territory. The PGA mechanism passes through to customers increases or decreases in the natural gas supply portion of the natural gas service rates based upon changes in the price of natural gas purchased from producers and wholesale marketers or changes in natural gas pipeline transportation costs. PSE's margin or net income is not affected by changes under the PGA mechanism because over and under recoveries of natural gas costs included in baseline PGA rates are deferred and either refunded or collected from customers, respectively, in future periods.\nOn December 5, 2017, the Washington Commission approved PSE's request within the 2017 GRC to extend the decoupling mechanism with some changes to the methodology that took effect on December 19, 2017. Electric and natural gas delivery revenues will continue to be recovered on a per customer basis and electric fixed production energy costs will now be decoupled and recovered on a fixed monthly amount basis. The allowed decoupling revenue will no longer increase annually on January 1 for electric and natural gas customers and these amounts can only be changed in a GRC, Power Cost Only Rate Case (PCORC) or ERF filing. Other changes include regrouping of electric and natural gas non-residential customers and the exclusion of certain electric schedules from the decoupling mechanism going forward. The rate cap which limits the amount of revenues PSE can collect in its annual filings increased from 3.0% to 5.0% for natural gas customers but will remain at 3.0% for electric customers. The decoupling mechanism will end on the effective date of PSE's first GRC filed in or after 2021, or in a separate proceeding if appropriate unless the continuation of the mechanism is approved in either of those proceedings. PSE's decoupling mechanism over and under collections will still be collectible or refundable after this effective date even if the decoupling mechanism is not extended.\n \u2022 Electric retail sales increased $81.1 million due to increases in rates of $86.4 million primarily from the reduction of the residential exchange credits and an increase in the decoupling rate mechanism. The increase from rates was partially offset by $5.6 million due to a 0.3% reduction in retail electricity usage. The reduction in usage was due to a decrease of residential, commercial and industrial average use per customer of 0.6%, 2.7% and 2.5%, respectively, as a result of energy efficiency. The reduction in use per customer were offset by an increase in retail customers of 1.5% and an increase in heating degree days of 0.6% compared to 2015. \nThe following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as two other financial measures, electric margin and natural gas margin, that are considered non-GAAP financial measures.\u201d Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that includes adjustments that result in a departure from GAAP presentation. The presentation of electric margin and natural gas margin is intended to supplement an understanding of PSE's operating performance. Electric margin and natural gas margin are used by PSE to determine whether PSE is collecting the appropriate amount of revenue from its customers to maintain electric and natural gas margins to ultimately provide adequate recovery of operating costs, including interest and equity returns. PSE's electric margin and natural gas margin measures may not be comparable to other companies' electric margin and natural gas margin measures. Furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance.\nRegulatory Accounting\n \u2022 Non-cash items increased $83.6 million primarily due to changes in deferred taxes of $78.8 million. For further discussion, see Note 13, \"Income Taxes\" in Item 8. \nManagement estimated the fair value of Puget Energy's equity to be approximately $5.5 billion at the October 1, 2017 measurement date for the annual test of goodwill impairment. The carrying value of Puget Energy's equity was approximately $3.8 billion with the excess of the fair value over the carrying value representing 44.7% or $1.7 billion.\nPuget Energy's net income increased by $71.7 million, which is primarily attributable to PSE's net income increase of $76.4 million. The following are significant factors that impacted Puget Energy's net income which are not included in PSE's discussion:\ncomputer software net additions of $123.7 million; (iv) amortization of PTC regulatory liability of $2.1 million in 2017; (v) a decrease of Lower Snake River U.S. Treasury interest amortization of $3.2 million; (vi) an increase of ARO accretion expense of $2.8 million due to a change in the Colstrip ARO in 2016; and (vii) conservation amortization increased $13.4 million, $10.3 for electric and $3.2 for natural gas, primarily due to an increase of usage attributed to an increase in heating degree days and customers for both electric and natural gas in 2017 as compared to 2016.\nThe following table sets forth conservation rider rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE's revenue based on the effective dates:\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures - Electric and Natural Gas Margins\nPSE's ability to issue additional secured debt may also be limited by certain restrictions contained in its electric and natural gas mortgage indentures. Under the most restrictive tests, at December 31, 2017, PSE could issue:\n \u2022 Utility operations and maintenance expense increased $15.8 million primarily driven by increases in the following: $6.7 million for electric and natural gas operations primarily due to increased electric operations third-party service provider costs of $3.2 million and gas distribution system integrity costs of $2.0 million $5.5 million increase in outside services expense for customer service optimization initiatives that began in 2016, and a $4.6 million increase in overall labor expense. These increases were partially offset by $1.6 million reduction of uncollectible account costs compared to 2016. \n \u2022 Wholesale commodity prices of electricity and natural gas; \n* Calculation not applicable.\nPSE also has other limited postretirement benefit plans. PSE recognized income of $0.5 million, $0.5 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, Puget Energy recognized incremental expense of $0.2 million each year. In 2018, it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize income of $0.5 million and incremental expense of $0.2 million, respectively.\nThe following chart displays the details of PSE's other operating expenses and other income (deductions) from period 2016 to 2017:\n \u2022 Net unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments expense decreased $71.1 million to a net gain of $83.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The primary drivers for the 2016 net gain consist of a $61.7 million gain from contract settlements previously recorded as losses in the 2015 unrealized gain on derivative instruments that settle to purchased electricity and electric generation fuel. The $61.7 million gain from contract settlements was comprised of a $39.7 million gain from natural gas and a $22.0 million gain from wholesale electric contract settlements. Natural gas and wholesale electricity gain increased $22.1 million primarily due to increases in forward market prices of 5.7% and 10.8%, respectively. This compares to a net gain of $12.7 million in 2015, comprised of $83.6 million in settlement gains offset by a $70.9 million loss due to a decrease in natural gas and wholesale electricity prices. \n\nThe Washington Commission approved the following PSE requests to change rates under its electric and natural gas decoupling mechanisms:\n \u2022 Reduction to the cumulative deferral trigger for surcharge or refund from $30.0 million to $20.0 million; \n \u2022 Natural gas retail sales increased $148.1 million due to an increase of $155.1 million in natural gas sales, which is a result of an increase in natural gas load of 18.0% from 2016, partially offset by a decrease in revenue per therm of $6.9 million. The decrease in revenue per therm was primarily due to a rate decrease on customer bills for PGA, which decreased rates 0.4% effective November 1, 2016 and increase in decoupling rates of 2.4% effective May 1, 2017, see Management's Discussion and Analysis, \"Regulation and Rates\" included in Item 7 of this report for natural gas rate changes. Natural gas load increased primarily due to the increase in average therms used per residential and commercial customers of 17.4% and 18.9%, respectively, compared to 2016 as a result of a 19.9% increase in heating degree days and an increase of 1.5% in natural gas customers, which increased the natural gas heating load compared to prior year. \n* Includes decoupling cash collections, rate of return excess earnings, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve.\n \u2022 Equal sharing between PSE and its customers of earnings which exceed PSE's authorized rate of return; \n \u2022 Other decoupling revenue decreased $6.5 million due to an increase in decoupling collections of $9.5 million due to an increase in rates in 2017. In 2016, there was $1.3 million of decoupling deferred revenue that could not be collected within 24 months compared to no reserve in the current year. The decoupling collection and refund of rate of return (ROR) excess earnings are driven by the tariff rates and retail sales. \nThe following table sets forth property tax tracker mechanism rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE's revenue based on the effective dates:", "item_7_text": " \u2022 Residential exchange credits decreased $42.6 million resulting from lower Residential Exchange Program (REP) credits associated with the BPA REP settlement. The REP credit tariff was lowered effective October 1, 2015. The REP credit is a pass-through tariff item with a corresponding credit in electric operating revenue, with no impact on net income. The Northwest Power Act, through the REP, provides access to the benefits of low-cost federal power for residential and small farm customers of regional utilities, including PSE. The program is administered by BPA. Pursuant to agreements (including settlement agreements) between BPA and PSE, BPA has provided payments of REP benefits to PSE, which PSE has passed through to its residential and small farm customers in the form of electricity bill credits. \nOn October 7, 2016, PSE filed a tariff to provide open access service to a narrow set of qualifying customers. Subsequent to that tariff filing, parties to the case reached an all-party settlement that converted the tariff to a special contract only allowing retail access for the loads of the Microsoft Corporation currently being served under PSE's electric Schedule 40. The special contract includes the following conditions: (i) Microsoft exceed Washington State's current renewable portfolio standards, (ii) the remainder of power sold to it be carbon free, (iii) there be no reduction in its funding of PSE's conservation programs, (iv) an exit fee be paid that will be a straight pass-through to customers and (v) Microsoft fund enhanced low-income support. A definitive agreement among the parties, the special contract and supportive testimony were filed with the Washington Commission on April 11, 2017 with hearings that occurred on May 3, 2017. The Washington Commission issued an order on July 13, 2017 approving PSE's special contract with Microsoft. Microsoft cannot begin taking service under the special contract until it has the required metering installed, has contracts for the supply and transmission of its power supply and pays the exit fee. PSE currently anticipates these conditions will be met in early 2019.\nThe Company's 2017 return on AMA equity was 9.0%, which is lower than the authorized regulated ROE primarily due to the following:\nWashington state law also requires PSE to pursue electric conservation that is cost-effective, reliable and feasible. PSE's mandate to pursue electric conservation initiatives may have a negative impact on the electric business financial performance due to lost margins from lower sales volumes as variable power costs are not part of the decoupling mechanism. Although not specified by Washington state law, the Washington Commission also sets natural gas conservation achievement standards for PSE. The effects of achieving these standards will, however, have only a slight negative impact on natural gas business financial performance due to the natural gas business being almost fully decoupled.\n \u2022 Natural gas retail sales revenue decreased $53.7 million due to a decrease in revenue per therm of $90.6 million, partially offset by an increase of $41.0 million in natural gas sales, due to an increase in natural gas load of 4.6% from 2015. The decrease in revenue per therm was primarily due to a rate decrease on customer bills for PGA, which decreased rates 17.4% effective November 1, 2015 partially offset by an increase in decoupling rates of 2.8% effective May 1, 2016, see Management's Discussion and Analysis, \"Regulation and Rates\" included in Item 7 of this report for natural gas rate changes. Natural gas load increased primarily due to the increase in average therms used per residential and commercial customers of 4.0% and 0.7%, respectively, compared to 2015. In addition, natural gas customers increased by 1.6% and heating degree days increased by 0.6%, which increased the natural gas heating load compared to prior year. \n 1 As of December 31, 2017, PSE had a credit facility which provides $800.0 million of short-term liquidity needs and includes a backstop to the Company's commercial paper program. The credit facility matures in October 2022. The credit facility also includes a swingline feature allowing same day availability on borrowings up to $75.0 million and an expansion feature that, upon the banks' approval, would increase the total size of the facility to $1.4 billion. As of December 31, 2017, no loans or letters of credit were outstanding under the credit facility and $329.5 million was outstanding under the commercial paper program. The credit agreement is syndicated among numerous lenders. Outside of the credit agreement, PSE has a $3.1 million letter of credit in support of a long-term transmission contract and a $1.0 million letter of credit in support of natural gas purchases in Canada. \nElectric Operating Revenue\n \u2022 Taxes other than income taxes increased $8.1 million primarily due to an increase in electric property taxes of $6.0 million based on assessed value and levy rates, electric state excise and municipal taxes of $5.8 million driven by an increase in electric revenue, partially offset by a decrease of $4.8 million in natural gas state excise and municipal taxes from a decrease in natural gas revenue.  Other Income, Interest Expense and Income Tax Expense\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n2015 compared to 2016\nThe goodwill recorded by Puget Energy represents the potential long-term return to the Company's investors. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually using a qualitative and quantitative test. Management must first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances during a qualitative assessment, management determines the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the entity shall perform a quantitative test to determine impairment. This would entail a full valuation of Puget Energy's assets and liabilities and comparing the valuation to its carrying amounts, with the aggregate difference indicating the amount of impairment. Goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount.\nASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures\u201d (ASC 820), defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). However, as permitted under ASC 820, the Company utilizes a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point price between bid and ask prices) as a practical expedient for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value. The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable. The Company primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements as it believes that this approach is used by market participants for these types of assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. For further discussion on market risk, see Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\".\nNatural Gas Operating Revenue\n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization expense increased $55.8 million primarily due to the following: (i) electric depreciation expense of $12.1 million, primarily due to asset net additions to distribution, transmission, and general plant of $186.4 million, $92.0 million and $83.1 million respectively; (ii) natural gas depreciation expense of $6.1 million increased due primarily to net additions to distribution assets of $192.3 million; (iii) $15.5 million of amortization expense due to \n_______________\nOther Challenges and Strategies\n * Includes decoupling cash collections, rate of return excess earnings, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve. \n 3 Other non-current assets and liabilities include funding of pension liability. \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nthe additional revenue can be recognized when the following criteria specified by ASC 980 are met: (i) the program is established by an order from the Washington Commission that allows for automatic adjustment of future rates, (ii) the amount of additional revenues for the period is objectively determinable and is probable of recovery and (iii) the additional revenues will be collected within 24 months following the end of the annual period in which they are recognized. PSE meets the criteria to recognize revenue under the decoupling mechanism. The Company will not record any decoupling revenue that is expected to take longer than 24 months to collect following the end of the annual period in which the revenues would have otherwise been recognized. Once determined to be collectible within 24 months, any previously non-recorded amounts will be recorded.\n\nFor additional information, see Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\" Note 9, \"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\" and Note 10, \"Fair Value Measurements\" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K. The discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as Puget Energy, Inc. (Puget Energy) and Puget Sound Energy, Inc. (PSE) objectives, expectations and intentions. Words or phrases such as anticipates,\u201d believes,\u201d continues,\u201d could,\u201d estimates,\u201d expects,\u201d future,\u201d intends,\u201d may,\u201d might,\u201d plans,\u201d potential,\u201d predicts,\u201d projects,\u201d should,\u201d will likely result,\u201d will continue\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify certain of these forward-looking statements. However, these words are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. Puget Energy's and PSE's actual results could differ materially from results that may be anticipated by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this report. Except as required by law, neither Puget Energy nor PSE undertakes an obligation to revise any forward-looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may subsequently arise. Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made in this report and in Puget Energy's and PSE's other reports filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect Puget Energy's and PSE's business, prospects and results of operations.\nThe Company's 2016 return on AMA equity was 8.9%, which is lower than the authorized regulated ROE primarily due to the following:\nASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging\u201d (ASC 815), requires that all contracts considered to be derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value unless the contracts qualify for an exception. The Company enters into derivative contracts to manage its energy resource portfolio and interest rate exposure including forward physical and financial contracts and swaps. Some of PSE's physical electric supply contracts qualify for the normal purchase normal sale (NPNS) exception to derivative accounting rules. Generally, NPNS applies to contracts with creditworthy counterparties, for which physical delivery is probable and in quantities that will be used in the normal course of business. Power purchases designated as NPNS must meet additional criteria to determine if the transaction is within PSE's forecasted load requirements and if the counterparty owns or controls energy resources within the western region to allow for physical delivery of the energy. PSE may enter into financial fixed contracts to economically hedge the variability of certain index-based contracts. Those contracts that do not meet the NPNS exception are marked-to-market to current earnings in the statements of income. Natural gas derivative contracts qualify for deferral under ASC 980 due to the PGA mechanism.\nExisting deferrals may be included in customer rates beginning in May 2018, subject to subsequent application of the earnings test and the cap on decoupling related rate increases for natural gas customers, which was changed from 3.0% to 5.0% as a result of the Washington Commission order in PSE's GRC.\n\n \u2022 Federal, state, and local taxes. \nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\n \u2022 Decoupling revenue decreased $48.6 million primarily due to an increase in use per customer, driven by an increase in heating degree days as discussed above in natural gas retail sales. This caused actual revenue to increase closer to PSE's allowed revenue, which lowered decoupled revenue in 2017. \n \u2022 Electric retail sales increased $112.5 million due an increase of $100.0 million from additional retail electricity usage of 4.2% compared to the prior year and an increase in rates of $12.5 million due to the decoupling rate mechanism. The additional usage was due to an increase of residential and commercial use per customer of 6.7% and 2.2%, respectively, an increase in heating degree days of 19.9% compared to 2016, and an increase in retail customers of 1.4%. \nGeneral Rate Case Filing\nElectric Margin\nThe Company's pension and other postretirement benefits income or expense depend on several factors and assumptions, including plan design, timing and amount of cash contributions to the plan, earnings on plan assets, discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, mortality and health care cost trends. Changes in any of these factors or assumptions will affect the amount of income or expense that the Company records in its financial statements in future years and its projected benefit obligation. The Company has selected an expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and the Company's investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors. The Company's accounting policy for calculating the market-related value of assets is based on a five-year smoothing of asset gains or losses measured from the expected return on market-related assets. This is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years. The same manner of calculating market-related value is used for all classes of assets, and is applied consistently from year to year. During 2017, the Company made cash contributions of $18.0 million to the qualified defined benefit plan. Management is closely monitoring the funding status of its qualified pension plan. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company's qualified pension plan was $3.9 million overfunded and $32.3 million underfunded as measured under GAAP, or 100.6% and 95.0% funded, respectively. As of January 1, 2018, the plan's estimated funded ratio, as calculated under guidelines from The Pension Protection Act of 2006 and considering temporary interest rate relief measures approved by Congress, was more than 100%. The aggregate expected contributions and payments by the Company to fund the pension plan, SERP and other postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2018 are expected to be at least $18.0 million, $5.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively.\nPuget Energy's net income decreased by $137.7 million, which is primarily attributable to an income tax expense increase of $79.3 million, as well as PSE's net income decrease of $60.5 million. The following are significant factors that impacted Puget Energy's net income which are not included in PSE's discussion:\n \u2022 Approximately $2.6 billion of additional first mortgage bonds under PSE's electric mortgage indenture based on approximately $4.3 billion of electric bondable property available for issuance, subject to an interest coverage ratio limitation of 2.0 times net earnings available for interest (as defined in the electric utility mortgage), which PSE exceeded at December 31, 2017; and \n 3 Other non-current assets and liabilities include funding of pension liability. \nThe decoupling mechanism allows PSE to recover delivery costs on a per customer basis rather than on a consumption basis. Included in the decoupling petition was a rate plan that allows PSE an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return without the need for another GRC process during the rate plan period. The rate plan included predetermined annual increases to PSE's allowed electric and natural gas revenue. This plan required PSE to file a GRC no later than April 1, 2016, which was later extended to January 17, 2017. The GRC was filed with the Washington Commission on January 13, 2017.\n \u2022 Income tax expense increased $49.4 million primarily driven by $44.0 million from higher pre-tax income and an increase of $6.5 million due to Hopkins Ridge no longer generating PTCs. PTCs are generated for the first ten years at a wind facility. As of December 2015, Hopkins Ridge is no longer eligible to generate PTCs. For additional information, see Note 13, \"Income Taxes\" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. \n\n \u2022 Other decoupling revenue decreased $4.5 million due to an increase of $16.8 million of decoupling collections as compared to 2015 from an increase in rates in 2016; partially offset by a decrease in the ROR excess earnings sharing of $13.5 million from a reduction in the ROR excess earnings accrual of $6.5 million compared to 2015 and an increase of $7.0 million in refunds to customers for the 2015 ROR excess earnings set into customer rates in 2016. The decoupling collection and refund of ROR excess earnings are driven by the tariff rates and retail sales. \nElectric power costs increased $40.1 million primarily due to a decrease of $42.6 million of residential exchange credit, an increase of $32.1 million of purchased electricity costs, partially offset by a decrease of $34.6 million of electric generation fuel expense. These items are discussed in detail below:\nThe following table summarizes the results of the income valuation method, using the long-term growth rate and weighted average cost of capital:\nSummary Results of Operations\nOther Operating Expenses\nOther Income, Interest Expense and Income Tax Expense\nFederal Incentive Tracker Tariff\nNatural Gas Conservation Rider\n_______________\nSummary Results of Operations\nCompetition\nThe income approach and the market approach valuations resulted in Puget Energy equity values of $5.2 and $5.8 billion, respectively. The result of the income approach was very sensitive to long-term cash flow growth rates applicable to periods beyond management's five-year business plan and financial forecast period and the weighted-average cost of capital assumptions of 3.0% and 5.9%, respectively.\nOn September 28, 2016, the Washington Commission approved PSE's tariff revision to create an additional voluntary renewable energy product, effective September 30, 2016. This provides customers with energy choices to help them meet their sustainability goals. Incremental costs of the program will be allocated to the voluntary participants of the program as is the case with PSE's existing Green Power programs. PSE initially offered this service, Green Direct, to larger customers (aggregated annual loads greater than 10,000,000 kWh) and government customers. Approximately 136.8 MW of new wind generation facilities will be constructed in the region by a developer under contract to PSE to meet the demand for this voluntary renewable energy product project. PSE anticipates that customers will start receiving energy through this program in 2019.\n \u2022 Depreciation expense was $10.5 million higher than the amount allowed in rates for the year ended December 31, 2016. \nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016\nElectric Power Costs\n\nThe following are PSE's and Puget Energy's aggregate availability under commercial commitments as of December 31, 2017:\nThe following chart displays the changes in PSE's natural gas margin from 2016 to 2017:\nThe following tables reflect the estimated sensitivity associated with a change in certain significant actuarial assumptions (each assumption change is presented mutually exclusive of other assumption changes):\nPuget Sound Energy\n\n \u2022 Utility operations and maintenance expense increased $37.8 million primarily driven by (i) an increase of $26.9 million of maintenance expense primarily related to natural gas leak repairs and sewer cross bore inspections, maintenance on gearboxes and generators at the Hopkins Ridge and Wild Horse wind generation facilities, electric distribution maintenance for overhead lines and vegetation management; (ii) an increase of outside services expense of $7.4 million primarily related to customer service initiatives; (iii) an increase of salary expense of $2.9 million primarily related to incentive increases; partially offset by (iv) a decrease of $4.6 million in meter reading expense due to the purchase of previously leased meter reading equipment during 2015. \nPSE's operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. These regulations cover electric system reliability, natural gas pipeline system safety and energy market transparency, among other areas. Environmental laws and regulations related to air and water quality, including climate change and endangered species protection, waste handling and disposal (including generation by-products such as coal ash), remediation of contamination and siting new facilities also impact the Company's operations. PSE must spend a significant amount of resources to fulfill requirements set by regulatory agencies, many of which have greatly expanded mandates on measures including resource planning, remediation, monitoring, pollution control equipment and emissions-related abatement and fees.\n 1 Equity adjustments are related to removing the impacts of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), subsidiary retained earnings, retained earnings of derivative instruments, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve. \n\nThe following table presents PSE's ROE, its return on AMA equity and its authorized regulated ROE for 2017 and 2016:\n \u2022 Approximately $535.0 million of additional first mortgage bonds under PSE's natural gas mortgage indenture based on approximately $891.7 million of natural gas bondable property available for issuance, subject to a combined natural gas and electric interest coverage test of 1.75 times net earnings available for interest and a natural gas interest coverage test of 2.0 times net earnings available for interest (as defined in the natural gas utility mortgage), both of which PSE exceeded at December 31, 2017  At December 31, 2017, PSE had approximately $7.2 billion in electric and natural gas rate base to support the interest coverage ratio limitation test for net earnings available for interest.\n \u2022 Non-utility and other expense increased $14.5 million primarily due to an increase in the long-term incentive plan of $12.3 million in 2017 which resulted from a total return in 2017 of 29.1% which resulted in the total return component to be funded at 200.0%. For more information see Part III, \"Executive Compensation\" included in Item 11 of this report for the Company's long term incentive plan. \nOther\nThe PCA settlement also resulted in the following changes to the PCA mechanism:\n 2 The authorized regulated return on equity rate changed to 9.5% effective December 19, 2017, per the approved GRC. \nThe following table sets forth residential exchange benefit adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding expected annual impact on PSE's revenue based on the effective dates:\n_______________\n \u2022 Net unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments expense increased $114.6 million to a net loss of $30.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The primary drivers for the increase consist of a reduction of $20.6 million in gains from contract settlements previously recorded as losses that settled to purchased electricity or electric generation fuel and a $94.0 million loss due to a decrease in natural gas and electricity forward prices of 26.9% and 27.5%, respectively. The $20.6 million reduction from contract settlements was comprised of a $16.5 million from natural gas and a $4.1 million from wholesale electric contracts. The decrease in the weighted average natural gas and wholesale electric forward prices resulted in a $78.4 million loss and a $15.6 million loss, respectively. \n \u2022 Transportation and other revenue increased $92.5 million primarily due to a change in production tax credit (PTC) deferral revenue of $73.2 million due to a $19.9 million reduction to revenue in 2016 as PTCs were generated compared to no PTC generated in 2017, as well as, a $51.2 million remeasurement of the PTC deferral in 2017 due to tax law change. Additionally, there was an increase in net wholesale natural gas sales of $17.5 million due to increased purchased electricity, as discussed below. \nThe following table sets forth CRM rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE's revenue based on the effective dates:\nThe Company's external financing requirements principally reflect the cash needs of its construction program, its schedule of maturing debt and certain operational needs. The Company anticipates refinancing the redemption of bonds or other long-term borrowings with its credit facilities and/or the issuance of new long-term debt. Access to funds depends upon factors such as Puget Energy's and PSE's credit ratings, prevailing interest rates and investor receptivity to investing in the utility industry, Puget Energy and PSE. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity through its credit facilities and access to capital markets to fund its needs over the next twelve months.\nThe following table sets forth PGA rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE's revenue based on the effective dates:\nNatural Gas Margin\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, other than the items disclosed in Note 8, \"Leases\" and in Note 15, \"Commitment and Contingencies\" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 2 of this report.\n\nThe rates that PSE is allowed to charge for its services influence its financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. PSE is highly regulated and the rates that it charges its retail customers are approved by the Washington Commission. The Washington Commission has traditionally required these rates be determined based, to a large extent, on historic test year costs plus weather normalized assumptions about hydroelectric conditions and power costs in the relevant rate year. Incremental customer growth and sales typically have not provided sufficient revenue to cover general cost increases over time due to the combined effects of regulatory lag and attrition. In addition, the Washington Commission determines whether the Company's expenses and capital investments are reasonable and prudent for the provision of cost effective, reliable and safe electric and natural gas service. If the Washington Commission determines that an operating expense or capital investment does not meet the reasonable and prudent standards, the costs (including return on any resulting rate base) related to such operating expense or capital investment may be disallowed, partially or entirely, and not recovered in rates.\n\nAccess to Debt Capital\n\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\n 1 Non-cash items include depreciation, amortization, deferred income taxes, net unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments, AFUDC-equity, production tax credits and other miscellaneous non-cash items. \nNatural Gas Energy Costs\nIn 2009, Puget Holdings completed its merger with Puget Energy. Puget Energy remeasured the carrying amount of all its assets and liabilities to fair value, which resulted in recognition of approximately $1.7 billion in goodwill. ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,\u201d (ASC 350) requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the Company's business or regulatory outlook, legal factors, a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit or significant changes in the financial markets which could influence the Company's access to capital and interest rates. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units and the determination of the fair value of the reporting units. Management has determined Puget Energy has only one reporting unit.\nOther Operating Expenses\nThe following are PSE's and Puget Energy's aggregate contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nThe following table sets forth property tax tracker mechanism rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE's revenue based on the effective dates:\nPSE relies on access to bank borrowings and short-term money markets as sources of liquidity and longer-term capital markets to fund its utility construction program, to meet maturing debt obligations and other capital expenditure requirements not satisfied by cash flow from its operations or equity investment from its parent, Puget Energy. Neither Puget Energy nor PSE have any debt outstanding whose maturity would accelerate upon a credit rating downgrade. However, a ratings downgrade could adversely affect the Company's ability to renew existing, or obtain access to new credit facilities and could increase the cost of such facilities. For example, under Puget Energy's and PSE's credit facilities, the borrowing costs increase as their respective credit ratings decline due to increases in credit spreads and commitment fees. If PSE is unable to access debt capital on reasonable terms, its ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions, including generating capacity, which may be relied on for future growth and to otherwise implement its strategy, could be adversely affected. PSE monitors the credit environment and expects to continue to be able to access the capital markets to meet its short-term and long-term borrowing needs. In October 2017, PSE and Puget Energy each entered into new 5-year credit facilities that replaced the previous facilities and are scheduled to mature in October 2022. For additional information on credit facilities, see Note 7, Liquidity Facilities and Other Financing Arrangements\" included in Item 8 of this report.\n \u2022 Other decoupling revenue decreased $2.7 million due to an increase in decoupling deferral collection of $17.9 million, as a result of an additional $17.3 million being set in rates on May 1, 2016, which was partially offset by a decrease in ROR excess earnings sharing accrual of $12.5 million and an increase in ROR excess earnings refund in 2016 of $2.5 million. The decoupling collection and refund of ROR excess earnings are driven by the tariff rates and customer usage. \nPurchased Gas Adjustment\n_______________\n \u2022 Residential exchange credits increased $6.1 million resulting from higher Residential Exchange Program (REP) credits associated with the BPA REP settlement due to the REP credit tariff increase in 2017 and increased usage. The REP credit is a pass-through tariff item with a corresponding credit in electric operating revenue, with no impact on net income. The Northwest Power Act, through the REP, provides access to the benefits of low-cost federal power for residential and small farm customers of regional utilities, including PSE. The program is administered by BPA. Pursuant to agreements (including settlement agreements) between BPA and PSE, BPA has provided payments of REP benefits to PSE, which PSE has passed through to its residential and small farm customers in the form of electricity bill credits. \nElectric Power Costs\nNatural gas operating revenue decreased $57.0 million primarily due to lower natural gas retail sales revenue of $53.7 million and a decrease in other decoupling revenue of $2.7 million, see discussion below.\nThe following chart displays the changes in PSE's natural gas margin from 2015 to 2016:\nElectric power costs increased $43.2 million primarily due to an increase of $58.4 million of purchased electricity costs, partially offset by a decrease of $9.1 million of electric generation fuel expense and an increase of $6.1 million of residential exchange credits. These items are discussed in detail below:\n\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016\nElectric operating revenues increased $110.0 million primarily due to higher retail sales of $81.1 million, increased decoupling revenue of $16.3 million and transportation and other revenue of $13.6 million. These items are discussed in detail below:\n2015 compared to 2016\n \u2022 Electric generation fuel expense decreased $9.1 million primarily due to a $2.7 million reduction in combustion turbine generation costs as a result of a 7.9% reduction in combustion turbine generation due to favorable wholesale electricity prices and a $6.3 million decrease in coal generation costs primarily at Colstrip units 3 and 4 for variable fuel costs due to less coal delivered and burned in 2017. \n\n \u2022 Purchased electricity expense increased $58.4 million primarily due to an 11.2% increase in wholesale electricity purchases, partially offset by a 0.2% decrease in prices. The increase in purchases was primarily driven by an increase in load and lower wholesale electricity prices on the open market compared to generating power. Additionally, a decrease of hydro and wind production of 7.4% and 14.7%, increased the need to purchase additional wholesale power. \nElectric Rates\n\nThe type and amount of future long-term financings for PSE may be limited by provisions in PSE's electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.\nNatural Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism\nThe following chart displays the changes in PSE's electric margin from 2016 to 2017:\nFactors and Trends Affecting PSE's Performance\nThe following chart displays the changes in PSE's electric margin from 2015 to 2016:\nSubstantially all the operations of Puget Energy are conducted through its regulated subsidiary, PSE. Puget Energy's results of operation for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nFair Value\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, in its PCA mechanism, PSE under recovered its power costs by $11.5 million of which no amount was apportioned to customers. This compares to an under recovery of power costs of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 of which no amounts were apportioned to customers. Although load increased in 2017 compared to 2016, that increase was offset by a decrease in the total baseline rate and an increase in costs. Additionally, the year over year variance was due to the 2017 mechanism changes where fixed production costs, other costs and adjustments are no longer included. The mechanism is now comparing variable PCA costs using the variable costs portion of the baseline rate. The fixed costs became part of the decoupling mechanism, effective December 19, 2017 as a result of the GRC but until then the revenue variance associated with the fixed production costs are being deferred using the fixed cost portion of the baseline rate. The revenue variance associated with the fixed production costs was deferred using the fixed cost portion of the baseline rate until December 19, 2017, when the fixed costs became part of the decoupling mechanism with the resolution of PSE's GRC.\nNatural gas operating revenue increased $107.3 million primarily due to higher retail sales of $148.1 million and increased other decoupling revenue of $5.9 million; partially offset by a decrease in decoupling revenue of $48.6 million. These items are discussed in the following details:\nVoluntary Long-Term Renewable Energy\nOverview\nCapital Requirements\nOther Proceedings\nBeginning July 1, 2013, certain revenues from PSE's electric and natural gas operations are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism under which PSE's actual energy delivery revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs are compared with authorized revenues allowed under the mechanism. The mechanism mitigates volatility in revenue due to weather and gross margin erosion related to energy efficiency. Any differences are deferred to a regulatory asset for under recovery or a regulatory liability for over recovery. Revenues associated with power costs under the PCA mechanism and PGA rates are excluded from the decoupling mechanism.\nRegulatory Compliance Costs and Expenditures\nRevenue Recognition\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n2016 compared to 2017\n2015 compared to 2016\n \u2022 Income Tax Expense increased by $79.3 million primarily due to tax reform passed on December 22, 2017 that lowered the corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%. As a result, income tax expense was effected by the revaluation of Puget Energy's deferred tax assets at the 21.0% rate. \n2016 compared to 2017\nProceeds from PSE's short-term borrowings and sales of commercial paper are used to provide working capital and the interim funding of utility construction programs. Puget Energy and PSE continue to have reasonable access to the capital and credit markets.\n_______________\nLarge Customer Retail Wheeling\n \u2022 Partially offsetting the above was net revenue from below the line activities and interest savings which totaled $28.2 million for an impact on ROE of positive 0.7%. \n \u2022 Taxes other than income taxes increased $32.0 million primarily due to increases in municipal taxes of $11.5 million and state excise taxes of $10.2 million as a result of an increase in revenue and an increase of $9.3 million in property taxes related to increased property values and expected levy rates. \n\n \u2022 Regulatory assets and liabilities cash flow increased $63.9 million primarily due to changes in decoupling and derivatives offset by changes in purchased gas adjustments. \n * Not meaningful and/or applicable. \nPSE's electric and natural gas utility retail customers generally do not have the ability to choose their electric or natural gas supplier; and therefore, PSE's business has historically been recognized as a natural monopoly. However, PSE faces competition from public utility districts and municipalities that want to establish their own municipal-owned utility, as a result of which PSE may lose a number of customers. Further, PSE faces increasing competition for sales to its retail customers. Alternative methods of electric energy generation, including solar and other self-generation methods, compete with PSE for sales to existing electric retail customers. In addition, PSE's natural gas customers may elect to use heating oil, propane or other fuels instead of using and purchasing natural gas from PSE.\nOther Operating Expenses and Other Income (Deductions)\n\n \u2022 Rates are based on an assumption of normal weather. The amount of variance due to weather was $13.2 million, which resulted in an impact on ROE of positive 0.3%. \nCapital Resources\n\nPuget Energy\nUtility Construction Program\nElectric operating revenues increased $182.2 million primarily due to higher retail sales of $112.5 million, increased transportation and other revenue of $92.5 million, partially offset by decreased decoupling revenue of $20.0 million and other decoupling revenue of $6.5 million. These items are discussed in detail below:\nFor information on Puget Energy and PSE dividends, long-term debt and credit facilities, see Note 4, Dividend Payment Restrictions, Note 6, Long-term Debt\u201d and Note 7, Liquidity Facilities and Other Financing Arrangements\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.\nElectric Conservation Rider\nThe program is subject to change based upon general business, economic and regulatory conditions. Utility construction expenditures and any new generation resource expenditures are typically funded from a combination of cash from operations, short-term debt, long-term debt and/or equity. PSE's utility construction program expenditures periodically can and do exceed cash flow generated from operations. As a result, execution of PSE's utility construction program is dependent, in part, on continued access to capital markets.\n 3 For additional information, see Note 8, \"Leases\" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. \nGoodwill\n \u2022 Regulated equity (rate base time's equity percent) was $478.0 million lower than AMA equity for the year ended December 31, 2017. The variance was primarily driven by the impact on rate base of the deferred tax liability for utility, plant and equipment. The impact on ROE for this variance was negative 1.2%. \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements. Management believes the following accounting policies are particularly important to the financial statements and require the use of estimates, assumptions and judgment to describe matters that are inherently uncertain.\n \u2022 General economic conditions in PSE's service territory and its effects on customer growth and use-per-customer; and \nCash generated from operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $242.8 million compared to the same period in 2016. The net difference was primarily impacted by the increase from cash flow provided by the operating activities of PSE, as previously discussed. The remaining variance is explained below:\n_______________\n \u2022 Other decoupling revenue increased $5.9 million due to the following: (i) an increase in decoupling collections of $14.7 million from an increase in the amortization rate in 2017 and an increase in therms used; (ii) in 2017, there was $19.6 million of deferred decoupling revenue that was recognized as it met the alternative revenue program revenue recognition criteria that it is expected to be collected from customers within 24 months, compared to the 24-month reserve of $9.6 million in 2016; and (iii) an increase in net overearnings accruals and cash refunds of $8.6 million. \n\n \u2022 Non-utility expense and other increased $5.1 million primarily due to legal outside services of $2.8 million and qualified pension expense of $1.2 million. \nThe following table sets forth PCORC and update compliance filing rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE's revenue based on the effective dates:\nPSE generates revenue and cash flow primarily from the sale of electric and natural gas services to residential and commercial customers within a service territory covering approximately 6,000 square miles, principally in the Puget Sound region of the state of Washington. PSE continually balances its load requirements, generation resources, purchase power agreements, and market purchases to meet customer demand. The Company's external financing requirements principally reflect the cash needs of its construction program, its schedule of maturing debt and certain operational needs. PSE requires access to bank and capital markets to meet its financing needs.\n 1 Energy purchase contracts were entered into as part of PSE's obligation to serve retail electric and natural gas customers' energy requirements. As a result, costs are generally recovered either through base retail rates or adjustments to retail rates as part of the power and natural gas cost adjustment mechanisms. \nAlso encompassed by regulatory accounting and subject to ASC 980 are the PCA and PGA mechanisms. The PCA and PGA mechanisms mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility upon the Company and are approved by the Washington Commission. The PCA mechanism provides for a sharing of costs that vary from baseline rates over a graduated scale. For further discussion regarding the PCA mechanism, see Item 7, \"Business - Regulation and Rates\". The increases and decreases in the cost of natural gas supply are reflected in customer bills through the PGA mechanism. PSE expects to fully recover/refund these regulatory balances through its rates. However, both mechanisms are subject to regulatory review and approval by the Washington Commission on a periodic basis.\nElectric Property Tax Tracker Mechanism\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nOn September 30, 2016, PSE filed an accounting petition with the Washington Commission, which requested deferral of the variances, either positive or negative, between the fixed costs previously recovered in the PCA and the revenue received to cover the allowed fixed costs. The deferral period requested was January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, when rates went into effect from PSE's 2017 GRC. On November 10, 2016, the Washington Commission issued Order No. 01 approving PSE's accounting petition. With the final determination in PSE's GRC, this deferral ceased with the rate effective date of December 19, 2017.\n 2 For individual long-term debt maturities, see Note 6, \"Long-Term Debt,\" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. For Puget Energy, the amount above excludes the fair value adjustments related to the merger. \n \u2022 Other non-current assets and liabilities cash flow decreased $38.8 million primarily due to an increase in the long-term incentive plan accrual, an increase in major maintenance and inspections, reduced pension funding and other changes in long-term assets and liabilities. \n \u2022 PSE's ability to supply electricity and natural gas, either through company-owned generation, purchase power contracts or by procuring natural gas or electricity in wholesale markets; \n 2 Changes in working capital include receivables, unbilled revenue, materials/supplies, fuel/gas inventory, income taxes, prepayments, purchased gas adjustments, accounts payable and accrued expenses. \n \u2022 Non-cash items increased $151.5 million primarily due to changes in derivative instruments of $114.6 million, depreciation and amortization of $42.4 million, deferred taxes of $36.1 million and conservation amortization of $13.4 million offset by a decrease of $53.3 million in production tax credits. For further discussion, see Other Operating Expenses in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis and Note 13, \"Income Taxes\" in Item 8. \n \u2022 Agreement, for a five-year period, that PSE will not file a GRC or PCORC within six months of the date rates go into effect for a PCORC filing; and \nResidential Exchange Benefit\nPuget Energy and PSE elected to de-designate all energy related derivative contracts previously recorded as cash flow hedges for the purpose of simplifying their financial reporting. The contracts that were de-designated related to physical electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts used to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation. For these contracts and contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market adjustments are recognized through earnings. The amount previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) is transferred to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings or sooner if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.\n \u2022 Interest expense decreased $6.3 million primarily due to a reduction of $3.8 million in interest on long-term debt related to debt that was refinanced in May 2015 at an interest rate of 4.30% compared to interest rates of 5.197% and 6.75%; and an increase of $1.7 million related to allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) debt due to an increase in average construction work in progress (CWIP). \nFactors affecting PSE's performance are set forth in this Overview\u201d section, as well as in other sections of the Management's Discussion and Analysis.\n * Includes decoupling cash collections, rate of return excess earnings, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve. \n \u2022 Regulatory compliance costs, including those related to new and developing federal regulations of electric system reliability, state regulations of natural gas pipelines and federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations; \nPower Cost Only Rate Case and Update Compliance Filing\n2016 compared to 2017\n \u2022 Electric generation fuel expense decreased $34.6 million primarily due to a $43.0 million reduction in combustion turbine costs as a result of a 28.8% reduction in combustion turbine generation due to favorable wholesale electricity prices and increased wind and hydro generation. This was partially offset by an $8.4 million increase in coal generation costs primarily due to an increase in the weighted-average cost of coal. \nCash generated from operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $267.9 million including a net income decrease of $60.5 million. The following are significant factors that impacted PSE's cash flows from operations:\nDerivatives\nNatural Gas Energy Costs\n \u2022 Transportation and other revenue increased $13.6 million primarily due to a reduction of amortization of PTC deferral credits of $10.1 million since PTC generation at Hopkins Ridge ended in 2015 and increase in net wholesale natural gas sales of $6.8 million. \n\n2015 compared to 2016\n_______________\n \u2022 PSE's ability to recover power costs that are included in rates, which are based on volume; \n 2 Changes in working capital include receivables, unbilled revenue, materials/supplies, fuel/gas inventory, income taxes, prepayments, purchased gas adjustments, accounts payable and accrued expenses. \n* Includes decoupling cash collections, rate of return excess earnings, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve.\nPSE has a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP). PSE recognized pension and other postretirement benefit expenses of $4.8 million, $4.8 million and $5.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, Puget Energy recognized incremental income of $0.5 million and $0.4 million, respectively. In 2018, it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize pension expense of $5.1 million and incremental pension income of $0.5 million, respectively.\nElectric Operating Revenue\nOperating utility revenue is recognized when the basis of service is rendered, which includes estimated unbilled revenue. PSE's estimate of unbilled revenue is based on a calculation using meter readings from its automated meter reading (AMR) system. The estimate calculates unbilled usage at the end of each month as the difference between the customer meter readings on the last day of the month and the last customer meter readings billed during the month less unbilled revenues recorded in the prior month. The \"current\" month unbilled usage is then priced at published rates for each schedule to estimate the unbilled revenues by customer.\nThe Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial derivative instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with its long-term debt financing and debt instruments. As of December 31, 2017, the Company did not have any outstanding interest rate swap instruments.\n \u2022 Increasing capital expenditures with additional depreciation and amortization; \nThe following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), as well as return on equity (ROE) excluding unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments (net income plus unrealized losses and/or minus unrealized gains on derivative instruments divided by average common equity) that is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.\u201d Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that includes adjustments that result in a departure from GAAP presentation. The Company believes that return on average of monthly averages (AMA) equity, also a non-GAAP measure, is a more suitable metric for comparing ROE across years and is a more accurate metric for assessing and evaluating ROE performance against the Company's authorized regulated ROE. The AMA equity is not intended to represent the regulated equity. PSE's ROE may not be comparable to other companies' ROE measures. Furthermore, this measure is not intended to replace ROE (GAAP net income divided by GAAP average common equity) as an indicator of operating performance.\n \u2022 Establishment of a five-year moratorium on changes to the PCA. \nPSE values derivative instruments based on daily quoted prices from an independent external pricing service. The Company regularly confirms the validity of pricing service quoted prices (e.g. Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) used to value commodity contracts to the actual prices of commodity contracts entered into during the most recent quarter. When external quoted market prices are not available for derivative contracts, PSE uses a valuation model that uses volatility assumptions relating to future energy prices based on specific energy markets and utilizes externally available forward market price curves. All derivative instruments are sensitive to market price fluctuations that can occur on a daily basis. The Company is focused on commodity price exposure and risks associated with volumetric variability in the natural gas and electric portfolios. PSE is not engaged in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of speculative trading. The Company economically hedges open natural gas and electric positions to reduce both the portfolio risk and the volatility risk in prices. The exposure position is determined by using a probabilistic risk system that models 250 simulations of how the Company's natural gas and power portfolios will perform under various weather, hydrological and unit performance conditions.\nElectric margin represents electric sales to retail and transportation customers less the cost of generating and purchasing electric energy sold to customers, including transmission costs to bring electric energy to PSE's service territory.\n\nPSE's ongoing regulatory requirements and operational needs necessitated the investment of substantial capital in 2017 and will continue to do so in future years. Because PSE intends to seek recovery of such investments through the regulatory process, its financial results depend heavily upon favorable outcomes from that process. The principal business, economic and other factors that affect PSE's operations and financial performance include:\n \u2022 The rates PSE is allowed to charge for its services; \nThe following table sets forth Federal Incentive Tracker Tariff rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE's revenue based on the effective dates:\nIn 2013, the Washington Commission issued final orders resolving the amended decoupling petition, the ERF filing and the Petition for Reconsideration (related to the TransAlta Centralia power purchase agreement). Order No. 7 in the ERF/decoupling proceeding approved PSE's ERF filing with a small change to its cost of capital to 7.77% which updated long-term debt costs and a capital structure that included 48.0% common equity with a return on equity (ROE) of 9.8%. This order also approved the property tax tracker discussed below and approved the amended decoupling and rate plan filing with the further condition that PSE will share 50.0% of any earnings in excess of the 7.77% authorized rate of return with customers. In addition, the K-Factor (rate plan) increase allowed decoupling revenue per customer for the recovery of delivery system costs to subsequently increase by 3.0% per year for electric customers and 2.2% per year for natural gas customers on January 1 of each year, until the effective date of new rates in PSE's General Rate Case (GRC). The new rates became effective December 19, 2017, as discussed below. In the decoupling mechanism, increases were subject to a cap of 3.0% of the total revenue for customers.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this document. The following discussion provides the significant items that impacted PSE's results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nDebt Restrictive Covenants\nThe following table sets forth conservation rider rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding annual impact on PSE's revenue based on the effective dates:\nPower Cost Adjustment Mechanism\nThe residential exchange program passes through the residential exchange program benefits that PSE will be receiving from the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) between October 1, 2017 and September 30, 2019. Rates change bi-annually on October 1.\n_______________\n \u2022 Suspension of the requirement that a GRC must be filed within three months after rates are approved in a PCORC; \nThe following chart displays the details of PSE's other operating expenses and other income (deductions) from period 2015 to 2016:\nAs noted earlier, at the time of the filings below, the Company was also limited to a 3.0% annual decoupling related cap on increases in total revenue. This limitation has been triggered as follows:\n \u2022 Depreciation expense was $24.8 million higher than the amount allowed in rates for the year ended December 31, 2017 for an impact on ROE of negative 0.7%. \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization expense increased $15.7 million primarily due to $16.5 million of depreciation expense primarily due to net additions of $173.9 million of natural gas distribution assets, $148.5 million of electric distribution assets and $90.6 million of electric transmission assets. \nAs defined by Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 980, Regulated Operations\u201d (ASC 980), the decoupling mechanism is an alternative revenue program that allows billings to be adjusted for the effects of weather abnormalities, conservation efforts or other various external factors. PSE adjusts these billings in the future in response to these effects to collect additional revenues provided under the decoupling mechanism. Once billing of additional revenues under the decoupling mechanism is permitted,\n \u2022 Removal of fixed production costs from the PCA mechanism and placing them in the decoupling mechanism. Inclusion of these costs in the decoupling mechanism was subsequently approved in the GRC. These fixed production costs include: (i) return and depreciation/amortization on fixed production assets and regulatory assets and liabilities; (ii) return, depreciation, transmission expense and revenues on specific transmission assets; and (iii) hydroelectric, other production and other power related expenses and O&M costs; \nOn August 7, 2015, the Washington Commission issued an order approving the changes to the PCA mechanism. The settlement agreement took effect January 1, 2017 and will apply the following graduated scale:\nPSE has a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees of PSE. PSE recognized qualified pension expense of $12.1 million, $14.5 million and $22.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Of these amounts, approximately 51.6%, 55.5% and 58.5% were included in utility operations and maintenance expense in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and the remaining amounts were capitalized. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, Puget Energy recognized incremental qualified pension income of $13.4 million and $15.5 million, respectively. In 2018, it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize pension expense of $11.5 million and incremental qualified pension income of $13.0 million, respectively.\n \u2022 Regulated equity (rate base time's equity percent) was $360.0 million lower than AMA equity for the year ended December 31, 2016. The variance was primarily driven by the impact on rate base of the deferred tax liability for utility, plant and equipment. The impact on ROE for this variance was negative 1.0%. \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n_______________\n \u2022 Regulatory decisions allowing PSE to recover purchased power and fuel costs, on a timely basis; \nFor the discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements, see Note 2, \"New Accounting Pronouncements\" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.\n 3 As of December 31, 2017, Puget Energy had a revolving senior secured credit facility totaling $800.0 million, which matures in October 2022. The revolving senior secured credit facility is syndicated among numerous lenders. The revolving senior secured credit facility also has an expansion feature that, upon the banks' approval, would increase the size of the facility to $1.3 billion. As of December 31, 2017, there was $102.6 million drawn and outstanding under the Puget Energy credit facility. \nNatural Gas Property Tax Tracker Mechanism\n \u2022 Decoupling revenue decreased $20.0 million due to a decrease in decoupling deferrals of $23.5 million driven by actual revenue being closer to PSE's allowed revenue per the decoupling mechanism compared to 2016. The increase in actual revenue was due to an increase in load as discussed above in electric retail sales. This was partially offset by an increase in decoupling revenue of $3.5 million due to fixed production cost deferrals, which were removed from the PCA mechanism and placed into the decoupling mechanism effective January 1, 2017. \nAs a regulated entity of the Washington Commission and FERC, PSE prepares its financial statements in accordance with the provisions of ASC 980. The application of ASC 980 results in differences in the timing and recognition of certain revenue and expenses in comparison with businesses in other industries. The rates that are charged by PSE to its customers are based on cost base regulation reviewed and approved by the Washington Commission and FERC. Under the authority of these commissions, PSE has recorded certain regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2017 in the amount of $953.1 million and $1,758.6 million, respectively, and regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2016 of $1.1 billion and $653.3 million, respectively. Such amounts are amortized through a corresponding liability or asset account, respectively, with no impact to earnings. PSE expects to fully recover its regulatory assets and liabilities through its rates. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, PSE would be required to write off these regulatory assets and liabilities. In addition, if PSE determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of ASC 980, PSE could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities related to those operations not meeting ASC 980 requirements.\nDuring 2013, PSE completed an expedited rate filing (ERF), which was a limited scope rate proceeding, and established a decoupling mechanism for natural gas operations and electric transmission, distribution and administrative costs. The ERF proceeding established baseline rates on which the decoupling mechanism will operate during the rate plan period. The ERF also established a property tax tracker mechanism in which any difference between amounts in rates and property tax payments will be deferred and recovered in an annual filing based on the actual cash payments for the year.\nRegulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs\n2013 Expedited Rate Filing and Decoupling Decision\n 2 As of December 31, 2017, PSE had a revolving credit facility with Puget Energy in the form of a promissory note to borrow up to $30.0 million. \n 1 Non-cash items include depreciation, amortization, deferred income taxes, net unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments, AFUDC-equity, production tax credits and miscellaneous non-cash items. \n \u2022 Partially offsetting the above was net revenue from below the line activities which totaled $4.3 million. \nNatural Gas Rates\n \u2022 Weather conditions, including the impact of temperature on customer load; the impact of extreme weather events on budgeted maintenance costs; meteorological conditions such as snow-pack, stream-flow and wind-speed which affect power generation, supply and price; \n2016 compared to 2017\nThe discount rate used in accounting for pension and other benefit obligations decreased from 4.50% in 2016 to 4.00% in 2017. The discount rate used in accounting for pension and other benefit expense decreased from 4.65% in 2016 to 4.50% in 2017. The rate of return on plan assets for qualified pension benefits decreased from 7.75% in 2016 to 7.45% in 2017. The rate of return on plan assets for other benefits in 2017 and 2016 was 6.75%, respectively.\n\nPSE currently has a PCA mechanism that provides for the deferral of power costs that vary from the power cost baseline\u201d level of power costs. The power cost baseline\u201d levels are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydrological conditions. Excess power costs or savings are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism and will trigger a surcharge or refund when the cumulative deferral trigger is reached.\n \u2022 Income tax expense increased $36.6 million primarily driven by the impact of tax reform on the deferred tax balances and partially offset by a 4.3% decrease in pre-tax income. For additional information, see Note 13, \"Income Taxes\" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. \nCompliance with these or other future regulations, such as those pertaining to climate change, could require significant capital expenditures by PSE and may adversely affect PSE's financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nCash from Operations\n \u2022 Tax reform, the effect of lower tax rates, and regulatory treatment of excess deferred tax balances on rate base and customer rates; \nResults of Operations\nPurchased natural gas expense decreased $89.4 million primarily due to lower natural gas costs included in PGA rates effective November 1, 2015, which was partially offset by an increase in natural gas usage of 4.6%.\nPSE's construction programs for generating facilities, the electric transmission system, the natural gas and electric distribution systems and the Tacoma LNG facility are designed to meet regulatory requirements and customer growth and to support reliable energy delivery. Construction expenditures, excluding equity AFUDC, totaled $963.7 million in 2017. Presently planned utility construction expenditures, excluding equity AFUDC, are as follows:\n \u2022 Changes in cash flow resulting from working capital increased $151.8 million primarily due to changes in accounts receivable and unbilled revenue of $50.7 million, an increase to the purchased gas adjustment of $34.2 million as discussed previously in the electric and natural gas margin discussion, an increase of $27.5 million in materials and supplies, and an increase of $47.0 million in prepayments. \n \u2022 Availability and access to capital and the cost of capital; \n\n \u2022 Changes in cash flow resulting from working capital decreased $33.2 million primarily due to amounts owed to PSE related to Puget LNG. \n_______________\n 1 The increase in revenue is net of reductions from excess earnings of $11.9 million for electric and $2.2 million for natural gas effective May1, 2017, and $11.9 million for electric and $5.5 million for natural gas effective May 1, 2016. \nDecoupling Filings\nPuget Energy conducted its most recent annual impairment test as of October 1, 2017. The fair value of Puget Energy's reporting unit was estimated using the weighted-averages from an income valuation method, or discounted cash flow method, and a market valuation approach. These valuations required significant judgments, including: (i) estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts and other market factors, (ii) estimation of the long-term rate of growth for Puget Energy's business including other market factors, (iii) estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, (iv) the selection of utility holding companies determined to be comparable to Puget Energy, and (v) the determination of an appropriate weighted-average cost of capital or discount rate.\n \u2022 Purchased electricity expense increased $32.1 million primarily due to a 16.1% increase in wholesale electricity purchases, partially offset by a 8.3% decrease in wholesale electricity prices. The increase in purchases was primarily driven by an increase in load and lower wholesale electricity prices on the open market compared to generating power. Additionally, an increase of hydro and wind production of 32.2% and 14.4% decreased the need to purchase additional wholesale power due to favorable conditions. \nThe graduated scale that was applicable through December 31, 2016 was as follows:\nFinancing Program\nOn January 13, 2017, PSE filed its GRC with the Washington Commission the settlement agreement was accepted by the Washington Commission on December 5, 2017 and the rates became effective December 19, 2017. For further details regarding the 2017 GRC filing, see Note 3, \"Regulation and Rates\" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.\nFor additional information, see Business, \"Regulation and Rates\" included in Item 1 of this report.\nPurchased natural gas expense increased $46.1 million due to an increase in natural gas costs included in PGA rates effective November 1, 2016 as compared to those effective November 1, 2015, and an increase in natural gas usage of 18.0%.\nPuget Energy is an energy services holding company and substantially all of its operations are conducted through its subsidiary PSE, a regulated electric and natural gas utility company. PSE is the largest electric and natural gas utility in the state of Washington, primarily engaged in the business of electric transmission, distribution and generation and natural gas distribution. Puget Energy's business strategy is to generate stable cash flows by offering reliable electric and natural gas service in a cost-effective manner through PSE. Puget Energy also has a wholly-owned non-regulated subsidiary, Puget LNG, LLC (Puget LNG). Puget LNG was formed on November 29, 2016, and has the sole purpose of owning, developing and financing the non-regulated activity of the Tacoma LNG facility, currently under construction. All of Puget Energy's common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings, LLC (Puget Holdings). Puget Holdings is owned by a consortium of long-term infrastructure investors including Macquarie Infrastructure Partners, Macquarie Capital Group Limited, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation, and the Alberta Investment Management Corporation. Puget Energy and PSE are collectively referred to herein as the Company.\u201d\n \u2022 Decoupling revenue increased $16.3 million due to actual revenues were lower than PSE's allowed revenue per the decoupling mechanism compared to 2015. This increase was primarily from residential and commercial decoupled rate schedules, which increased $15.6 million in 2016. The increase was driven from an increase in customers which increases the allowed revenue and a decrease in use per customer, which lowers the actual revenue resulting in higher decoupled revenue. \nNatural gas margin is natural gas sales to retail and transportation customers less the cost of natural gas purchased, including transportation costs to bring natural gas to PSE's service territory. The PGA mechanism passes through to customers increases or decreases in the natural gas supply portion of the natural gas service rates based upon changes in the price of natural gas purchased from producers and wholesale marketers or changes in natural gas pipeline transportation costs. PSE's margin or net income is not affected by changes under the PGA mechanism because over and under recoveries of natural gas costs included in baseline PGA rates are deferred and either refunded or collected from customers, respectively, in future periods.\nOn December 5, 2017, the Washington Commission approved PSE's request within the 2017 GRC to extend the decoupling mechanism with some changes to the methodology that took effect on December 19, 2017. Electric and natural gas delivery revenues will continue to be recovered on a per customer basis and electric fixed production energy costs will now be decoupled and recovered on a fixed monthly amount basis. The allowed decoupling revenue will no longer increase annually on January 1 for electric and natural gas customers and these amounts can only be changed in a GRC, Power Cost Only Rate Case (PCORC) or ERF filing. Other changes include regrouping of electric and natural gas non-residential customers and the exclusion of certain electric schedules from the decoupling mechanism going forward. The rate cap which limits the amount of revenues PSE can collect in its annual filings increased from 3.0% to 5.0% for natural gas customers but will remain at 3.0% for electric customers. The decoupling mechanism will end on the effective date of PSE's first GRC filed in or after 2021, or in a separate proceeding if appropriate unless the continuation of the mechanism is approved in either of those proceedings. PSE's decoupling mechanism over and under collections will still be collectible or refundable after this effective date even if the decoupling mechanism is not extended.\n \u2022 Electric retail sales increased $81.1 million due to increases in rates of $86.4 million primarily from the reduction of the residential exchange credits and an increase in the decoupling rate mechanism. The increase from rates was partially offset by $5.6 million due to a 0.3% reduction in retail electricity usage. The reduction in usage was due to a decrease of residential, commercial and industrial average use per customer of 0.6%, 2.7% and 2.5%, respectively, as a result of energy efficiency. The reduction in use per customer were offset by an increase in retail customers of 1.5% and an increase in heating degree days of 0.6% compared to 2015. \nThe following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as two other financial measures, electric margin and natural gas margin, that are considered non-GAAP financial measures.\u201d Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that includes adjustments that result in a departure from GAAP presentation. The presentation of electric margin and natural gas margin is intended to supplement an understanding of PSE's operating performance. Electric margin and natural gas margin are used by PSE to determine whether PSE is collecting the appropriate amount of revenue from its customers to maintain electric and natural gas margins to ultimately provide adequate recovery of operating costs, including interest and equity returns. PSE's electric margin and natural gas margin measures may not be comparable to other companies' electric margin and natural gas margin measures. Furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance.\nRegulatory Accounting\n \u2022 Non-cash items increased $83.6 million primarily due to changes in deferred taxes of $78.8 million. For further discussion, see Note 13, \"Income Taxes\" in Item 8. \nManagement estimated the fair value of Puget Energy's equity to be approximately $5.5 billion at the October 1, 2017 measurement date for the annual test of goodwill impairment. The carrying value of Puget Energy's equity was approximately $3.8 billion with the excess of the fair value over the carrying value representing 44.7% or $1.7 billion.\nPuget Energy's net income increased by $71.7 million, which is primarily attributable to PSE's net income increase of $76.4 million. The following are significant factors that impacted Puget Energy's net income which are not included in PSE's discussion:\ncomputer software net additions of $123.7 million; (iv) amortization of PTC regulatory liability of $2.1 million in 2017; (v) a decrease of Lower Snake River U.S. Treasury interest amortization of $3.2 million; (vi) an increase of ARO accretion expense of $2.8 million due to a change in the Colstrip ARO in 2016; and (vii) conservation amortization increased $13.4 million, $10.3 for electric and $3.2 for natural gas, primarily due to an increase of usage attributed to an increase in heating degree days and customers for both electric and natural gas in 2017 as compared to 2016.\nThe following table sets forth conservation rider rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE's revenue based on the effective dates:\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures - Electric and Natural Gas Margins\nPSE's ability to issue additional secured debt may also be limited by certain restrictions contained in its electric and natural gas mortgage indentures. Under the most restrictive tests, at December 31, 2017, PSE could issue:\n \u2022 Utility operations and maintenance expense increased $15.8 million primarily driven by increases in the following: $6.7 million for electric and natural gas operations primarily due to increased electric operations third-party service provider costs of $3.2 million and gas distribution system integrity costs of $2.0 million $5.5 million increase in outside services expense for customer service optimization initiatives that began in 2016, and a $4.6 million increase in overall labor expense. These increases were partially offset by $1.6 million reduction of uncollectible account costs compared to 2016. \n \u2022 Wholesale commodity prices of electricity and natural gas; \n* Calculation not applicable.\nPSE also has other limited postretirement benefit plans. PSE recognized income of $0.5 million, $0.5 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, Puget Energy recognized incremental expense of $0.2 million each year. In 2018, it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize income of $0.5 million and incremental expense of $0.2 million, respectively.\nThe following chart displays the details of PSE's other operating expenses and other income (deductions) from period 2016 to 2017:\n \u2022 Net unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments expense decreased $71.1 million to a net gain of $83.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The primary drivers for the 2016 net gain consist of a $61.7 million gain from contract settlements previously recorded as losses in the 2015 unrealized gain on derivative instruments that settle to purchased electricity and electric generation fuel. The $61.7 million gain from contract settlements was comprised of a $39.7 million gain from natural gas and a $22.0 million gain from wholesale electric contract settlements. Natural gas and wholesale electricity gain increased $22.1 million primarily due to increases in forward market prices of 5.7% and 10.8%, respectively. This compares to a net gain of $12.7 million in 2015, comprised of $83.6 million in settlement gains offset by a $70.9 million loss due to a decrease in natural gas and wholesale electricity prices. \n\nThe Washington Commission approved the following PSE requests to change rates under its electric and natural gas decoupling mechanisms:\n \u2022 Reduction to the cumulative deferral trigger for surcharge or refund from $30.0 million to $20.0 million; \n \u2022 Natural gas retail sales increased $148.1 million due to an increase of $155.1 million in natural gas sales, which is a result of an increase in natural gas load of 18.0% from 2016, partially offset by a decrease in revenue per therm of $6.9 million. The decrease in revenue per therm was primarily due to a rate decrease on customer bills for PGA, which decreased rates 0.4% effective November 1, 2016 and increase in decoupling rates of 2.4% effective May 1, 2017, see Management's Discussion and Analysis, \"Regulation and Rates\" included in Item 7 of this report for natural gas rate changes. Natural gas load increased primarily due to the increase in average therms used per residential and commercial customers of 17.4% and 18.9%, respectively, compared to 2016 as a result of a 19.9% increase in heating degree days and an increase of 1.5% in natural gas customers, which increased the natural gas heating load compared to prior year. \n* Includes decoupling cash collections, rate of return excess earnings, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve.\n \u2022 Equal sharing between PSE and its customers of earnings which exceed PSE's authorized rate of return; \n \u2022 Other decoupling revenue decreased $6.5 million due to an increase in decoupling collections of $9.5 million due to an increase in rates in 2017. In 2016, there was $1.3 million of decoupling deferred revenue that could not be collected within 24 months compared to no reserve in the current year. The decoupling collection and refund of rate of return (ROR) excess earnings are driven by the tariff rates and retail sales. \nThe following table sets forth property tax tracker mechanism rate
