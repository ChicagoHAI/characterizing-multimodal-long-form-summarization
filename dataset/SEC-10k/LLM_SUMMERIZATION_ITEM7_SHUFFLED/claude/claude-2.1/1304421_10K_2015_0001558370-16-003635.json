In addition, the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Consolidated Communications Holdings, Inc. ( Consolidated\u201d, the Company\u201d, we\u201d or our\u201d). MD&A should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements ( Notes\u201d) as of and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThroughout MD&A, we refer to certain measures that are not a measure of financial performance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( US GAAP\u201d or GAAP\u201d). We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures on a consolidated basis provides the reader with additional information that is useful in understanding our operating results and trends. These measures should be viewed in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, those measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a more detailed discussion on the use and calculation of these measures.\nOverview\nWe are an integrated communications services company that operates as both an Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier ( ILEC\u201d) and a Competitive Local Exchange Carrier ( CLEC\u201d) dependent upon the territory served. We provide an array of services in consumer, commercial and carrier channels in 11 states, including local and long-distance service, high-speed broadband Internet access, video services, Voice over Internet Protocol ( VoIP\u201d), custom calling features, private line services, carrier grade access services, network capacity services over our regional fiber optic networks, data center and managed services, directory publishing, equipment sales and cloud data services.\nRevenues increased $140.0 million during 2015 compared to 2014, primarily from growth in commercial services, total data connections and the acquisition of Enventis Corporation ( Enventis\u201d) in October 2014, as described below. We generate the majority of our consolidated operating revenues primarily from subscriptions to our video, data and transport services (collectively broadband services\u201d) to business and residential customers. We expect our broadband services revenue to continue to grow as consumer and commercial demands for data based services increase.\nWe continue to focus on commercial and broadband growth opportunities and are continually expanding our commercial product offerings for both small and large businesses to capitalize on industry technological advances. We can leverage our fiber optic networks and tailor our services for business customers by developing solutions to fit their specific needs. We gained strategic advantage through the acquisition of Enventis in 2014, which recently launched a suite of cloud data services that increases efficiency and reduces IT costs for our customers. In addition, we recently launched an enhanced hosted voice product, which enables greater scalability and reliability for businesses. We anticipate future momentum in new commercial services as these new products gain traction.\nWe market services to our residential customers either individually or as a bundled package. Our triple play\u201d bundle includes our voice, video and data services. Data connections continue to increase as a result of consumer trends toward increased Internet usage and our enhanced product and service offerings, such as our progressively increasing consumer data speeds. We introduced data speeds of up to 1 Gbps to approximately 20,000 of our fiber-to-the-home customers in our Kansas market and a limited portion of our Pennsylvania market in December 2014 and in our Texas market in the first quarter of 2015, with our California market to follow in 2016. Where 1 Gbps speeds are not yet offered, the maximum broadband speed is 100 Mbps, depending on the geographic market availability. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 29% of the homes in the areas we serve subscribe to our data service.\nOur exceptional consumer broadband speed allows us to continue to meet the needs of our customers and the demand for higher speed resulting from the growing trend of over-the-top ( OTT\u201d) content viewing. The availability of 1 Gbps data speed also complements our wireless home networking ( Wi-Fi\u201d) that supports our TV Everywhere service and allows our subscribers to watch their favorite programs at home or away on a computer, smartphone or tablet.\nThe increase in our operating revenues during 2015 was offset, in part, by an anticipated industry-wide trend of a decline in consumer voice services, access lines and related network access. Many consumers are choosing to subscribe to\nalternative communications services and competition for these subscribers continues to increase. Excluding the increase in voice connections as a result of the acquisition of Enventis in 2014, total voice connections decreased 5% as of December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014. Competition from wireless providers, competitive local exchange carriers and, in some cases, cable television providers has increased in recent years in the markets we serve. We have been able to mitigate some of the access line losses through marketing initiatives and product offerings, such as our VoIP service. In addition, our video connection growth is decelerating. Excluding Enventis, total video connections decreased 6% as of December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014. The consumer's growing acceptance of OTT video services either to augment their current viewing options or to entirely replace their video subscription may impact our future video subscriber base, which could result in a decline in video revenue as well as a reduction in video programing costs. We believe this trend in changing consumer viewing habits will continue to impact our business model and strategy of providing consumers the necessary broadband speed to facilitate OTT content viewing.\nAs discussed in the Regulatory Matters\u201d section below, our operating revenues are also impacted by legislative or regulatory changes at the federal and state levels, which could reduce or eliminate the current subsidies revenue we receive. A number of proceedings and recent orders relate to universal service reform, intercarrier compensation and network access charges. There are various ongoing legal challenges to the orders that have been issued. As a result, it is not yet possible to determine fully the impact of the regulatory changes on our operations.\nSignificant Recent Developments\nEnventis Merger\nOn October 16, 2014, we completed our merger with Enventis and acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of Enventis in exchange for shares of our common stock. As a result, Enventis became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The total value of the purchase consideration exchanged was $257.7 million, excluding $149.9 million paid to extinguish Enventis' outstanding debt. On the date of the merger, we issued an aggregate total of 10.1 million shares of our common stock to the former Enventis shareholders.\nEnventis is an advanced communications provider, which services consumer, commercial and wholesale carrier customer channels primarily in the upper Midwest. The acquisition reflects our strategy to diversify revenue and cash flows amongst multiple products and to expand our network to new markets. The financial results for Enventis have been included in our consolidated financial statements as of the acquisition date.\nIn connection with the acquisition, in September 2014, we completed an offering of $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.50% senior notes due 2022 (the Existing Notes\u201d). The net proceeds from the issuance of the Existing Notes were used to finance the acquisition of Enventis, including related fees and expenses, and to pay the existing indebtedness of Enventis. A portion of the proceeds, together with cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility, was also used to redeem $72.8 million of our $300.0 million original aggregate principal amount of 10.875% Senior Notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes\u201d), as described in the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section below.\nIssuance of Additional Senior Notes\nOn June 8, 2015, we issued an additional $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (the New Notes\u201d and together with the Existing Notes, the 2022 Notes\u201d). The New Notes were priced at 98.26% of par and resulted in total gross proceeds of approximately $294.8 million, excluding accrued interest. The net proceeds from the issuance of the New Notes were used, in part, to redeem the remaining $227.2 million of the original aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes, to pay related fees and expenses and to reduce the outstanding balance of our revolving credit facility. In connection with the redemption of the 2020 Notes, we paid $261.9 million and recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $41.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOn October 16, 2015, we completed an exchange offer to register all of the 2022 Notes under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d). The terms of the registered 2022 Notes are substantially identical to the 2022 Notes prior to the exchange, except that the notes are now registered under the Securities Act and the transfer restrictions and registration rights applicable to the original 2022 Notes no longer apply to the registered 2022 Notes. The exchange offer did not impact the aggregate principal amount or the remaining terms of the 2022 Notes outstanding.\nDiscontinued Operations\nOn September 13, 2013, we completed the sale of the assets and contractual rights used to provide communications services to thirteen county jails located in Illinois. The sale was completed for an aggregate purchase price of $2.5 million, resulting in a gain of $1.3 million, net of tax. The financial results of the operations for our prison services business have been reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables reflect our financial results on a consolidated basis and key operating statistics as of and for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and

Enventis' results are included in our consolidated financial statements as of the date of the acquisition. The acquisition provides additional diversification of the Company's revenues and cash flows both geographically and by service type.\nOperating Revenues\nCommercial and Carrier\nData and Transport Services\nWe provide a variety of business communication services to small, medium and large business customers, including many services over our advanced fiber network. The services we offer include scalable high speed broadband Internet access and VoIP phone services which range from basic service plans to virtual hosted systems. In addition to Internet and VoIP services, we also offer private line data services to businesses that include dedicated Internet access through our Metro Ethernet network. Wide Area Network ( WAN\u201d) products include point-to-point and multi-point deployments from 2.5 Mbps to 10 Gbps to accommodate the growth patterns of our business customers. Data center and disaster recovery solutions provide a reliable and local colocation option for commercial customers. We also offer wholesale services to regional and national interexchange and wireless carriers, including cellular backhaul and other fiber transport solutions.\nData and transport services revenue increased $65.8 million during 2015 compared to 2014 and $23.0 million during 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding the addition of Enventis revenue of $57.5 million and $14.1 million, respectively, data and transport services revenue increased $8.3 million and $8.9 million, respectively, primarily from growth in data connections and a continued increase in VoIP, Internet access and Metro Ethernet revenue. Fiber transport and cellular backhaul revenue also increased as network bandwidth demand for wireless data continues to escalate.\nVoice Services\nVoice services include basic local phone and long-distance service packages for business customers. The plans include options for voicemail, conference calling, linking multiple office locations and other custom calling features such as caller ID, call forwarding, speed dialing and call waiting. Services can be charged at a fixed monthly rate, a measured rate or can be bundled with selected services at a discounted rate.\nVoice services revenue increased $10.4 million during 2015 compared to 2014 and $2.8 million during 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding the addition of Enventis revenue of $14.4 million and $3.8 million, respectively, voice services revenue decreased $4.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively, primarily due to a 5% decline in access lines during each period as commercial customers are increasingly choosing alternative technologies, including our own VoIP product, and the broad range of features that Internet based voice services can offer.\nConsumer\nBroadband Services\nBroadband services include revenue from residential customers for subscriptions to our VoIP, data and video products. We offer high speed Internet access at speeds of up to 1 Gbps, depending on the nature of the network facilities that are available, the level of service selected and the location. Our VoIP digital phone service is also available in certain markets\nas an alternative to the traditional telephone line. Depending on geographic market availability, our video services range from limited basic service to advanced digital television, which includes several plans each with hundreds of local, national and music channels including premium and pay-per-view channels as well as video on-demand service. Certain customers may also subscribe to our advanced video services, which consist of high-definition television, digital video recorders ( DVR\u201d) and/or a whole home DVR.\nBroadband services revenue increased $12.8 million during 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the addition of Enventis revenue of $13.5 million, broadband services revenue decreased $0.7 million primarily due to an 8% decline in video connections and increased discounts on our data service offerings. We expect data revenue to grow as a result of the rising consumer demand for data-based services. However, the revenue growth was tempered by a decrease in VoIP revenue during that same period due to a decline in voice connections as more consumers have begun to rely exclusively on wireless service.\nBroadband services revenue increased $5.7 million during 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding the addition of Enventis revenue of $3.4 million, broadband services revenue increased $2.3 million primarily due to growth in Internet access revenue and video subscriptions revenue.\nVoice Services\nWe offer several different basic local phone service packages and long-distance calling plans, including unlimited flat-rate calling plans. The plans include options for voicemail and other custom calling features such as caller ID, call forwarding and call waiting. Voice services revenue increased $0.4 million during 2015 compared to 2014 and decreased $3.7 million during 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding the addition of Enventis revenue of $5.5 million and $1.5 million, respectively, voice services revenue decreased $5.1 million and $5.2 million, respectively, primarily due to a 9% and 13% decline in voice connections, respectively. The number of local access lines in service directly affects the recurring revenue we generate from end users and continues to be impacted by the industry-wide decline in access lines. We expect to continue to experience modest erosion in voice connections due to competition from alternative technologies, including our own competing VoIP product.\nEquipment Sales and Service\nThrough our acquisition of Enventis in 2014, we obtained a leading market relationship with Cisco Systems, Inc. and, as a result, are an accredited Master Level Unified Communications and Gold Certified Cisco Partner providing equipment solutions and support for business customers. As an equipment integrator, we offer network design, implementation and support services, including maintenance contracts, in order to provide integrated communication solutions for our customers. When an equipment sale involves multiple deliverables, revenue is allocated to each respective element based on relative selling price. Equipment sales and services are non-recurring and changes in revenue can be attributed to the timing and volume of customer sales, which can vary each quarter and result in positive or negative fluctuations in our quarterly operating revenues and expenses. Equipment sales and service revenue increased $45.0 million during 2015 compared to 2014 and $10.0 million during 2014 compared to 2013 due to the acquisition of Enventis.\nSubsidies\nSubsidies consist of both federal and state subsidies, which are designed to promote widely available, quality telephone service at affordable prices in rural areas. Subsidies revenue increased $3.1 million during 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the addition of Enventis revenue of $6.8 million, subsidies revenue decreased $3.7 million as a result of a reduction in state funding support for our Texas ILEC and the transition from CAF Phase I to CAF Phase II funding. See the Regulatory Matters\u201d section below for further discussion of the subsidies we receive.\nSubsidies revenue increased $1.2 million during 2014 compared to 2013 primarily from the addition of Enventis revenue.\nNetwork Access Services\nNetwork access services include interstate and intrastate switched access revenue, network special access services and end user access. Switched access revenue includes access services to other communications carriers to terminate or originate long-distance calls on our network. Special access circuits provide dedicated lines and trunks to business customers and interexchange carriers. Network access services revenue decreased $1.8 million during 2015 compared to 2014 and $5.7\nmillion during 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding the addition of Enventis revenue of $6.0 million and $1.7 million, respectively, network access services revenue decreased $7.8 million and $7.4 million, respectively, primarily due to declines in switched and special access revenues. Special access revenue decreased primarily due to a reduction in the number of our carrier circuits; however, a portion of the decrease can be attributed to carriers shifting to our fiber Metro Ethernet product, contributing to the growth in that area. Switched access revenue decreased primarily as a result of the continuing decline in minutes of use and voice connections.\nOther Products and Services\nOther products and services include revenues from telephone directory publishing, video advertising and billing and support services. Other products and services revenue increased $3.5 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily from the addition of Enventis revenue of $3.9 million for its billing and support services and an increase in video advertising revenues, which was offset by a decline in directory publishing revenue.\nOther products and services revenue decreased $0.1 million during 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding the addition of Enventis revenue of $1.4 million, other products and services revenue decreased $1.5 million primarily due to a decline in directory publishing revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nCost of Services and Products\nCost of services and products increased $85.7 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the addition of the operations for Enventis during 2014, which accounted for $80.3 million of the increase. Video programming costs also increased $5.0 million as costs per program channel continue to rise. Video programming costs are impacted by license fees charged by cable networks, the amount and quality of the content we provide and the number of video subscribers we serve. We anticipate that programming costs will continue to increase due to the rising cost of license fees and as we add additional content and offer video content to various platforms. Network access costs also increased as a result of growth in carrier and wireless backhaul services. However, these increases were partially offset by a decline in employee costs due to a reduction in headcount.\nIn 2014, cost of services and products increased $20.2 million compared to 2013. The addition of the operations for Enventis during 2014 accounted for $18.8 million of the increase. Video programming costs also increased due to a growth in video connections and an increase in costs per program channel. However, the increase in video programming costs was largely offset by a decline in employee costs due to a reduction in headcount as a result of integration and cost reduction efforts in 2013 as well as a reduction in pension expense in 2014.\nSelling, General and Administrative Costs\nSelling, general and administrative costs increased $37.6 million during 2015 compared to 2014. The acquisition of Enventis in 2014 contributed $29.7 million of the increase. In addition, as part of the Company's continued integration efforts, an early retirement program was initiated during 2015 to a group of select employees who were 55 years of age or older and who have provided 15 or more years of service. The employees were primarily in non-customer facing positions or positions in which the Company believed the retiree's workload could be absorbed internally as part of the Company's continuing cost saving initiatives. The early retirement package was accepted by approximately 60 employees and, as a result, one-time severance costs of $7.2 million were incurred in 2015. The Company expects approximately $4.8 million in future annual savings as a result of the early retirement program. The remaining increase in selling, general and administrative costs was primarily due to an increase in property taxes and regulatory fees and increased pension costs in the current year. These increases were offset in part by a decline in employee-related costs and a reduction in advertising expense in 2015.\nSelling, general and administrative costs increased $5.2 million during 2014 compared to 2013 primarily as a result of the addition of the operations for Enventis in 2014, which accounted for $7.2 million of the annual increase. Excluding Enventis, selling, general and administrative expense decreased $2.0 million due to a decline in professional fees for legal and billing services and a reduction in pension costs in 2014. These savings were offset in part by growth in our commercial sales force as a result of the expansion of our commercial services in the Dallas market in 2014. Bad debt expense also increased due to recoveries recognized in 2013.\nAcquisition and Other Transaction Costs\nAcquisition and other transaction costs decreased $10.4 million during 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of the acquisition of Enventis, which closed in the fourth quarter of 2014. In 2014, we incurred $11.8 million in transaction related fees in connection with the acquisition of Enventis. Transaction costs consist primarily of legal, finance and other professional fees as well as expenses related to change-in-control payments to former employees of the acquired companies.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $30.5 million during 2015 compared to 2014, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Enventis during 2014 which accounted for $31.4 million of the increase. Excluding the addition of the operations for Enventis, depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.9 million in 2015 due to certain circuit, network and terminal equipment becoming fully depreciated during 2015, which was offset in part by capital expenditures for internally developed software and outside plant related to integration and success based projects.\nIn 2014, depreciation and amortization expense increased $10.1 million compared to 2013, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Enventis during 2014 which accounted for $8.0 million of the increase. The remaining increase was primarily associated with ongoing capital expenditures related to network enhancements and success based capital projects for consumer and commercial services.\nRegulatory Matters\nOur revenues are subject to broad federal and/or state regulation, which include such telecommunications services as local telephone service, network access service and toll service and are derived from various sources, including:\nTable 69: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nbusiness and residential subscribers of basic exchange services;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nsurcharges mandated by state commissions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nlong distance carriers for network access service;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncompetitive access providers and commercial customers for network access service; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nsupport payments from federal or state programs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe telecommunications industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation. Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, federal and state regulators share responsibility for implementing and enforcing statutes and regulations designed to encourage competition and to preserve and advance widely available, quality telephone service at affordable prices.\nAt the federal level, the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC\u201d) generally exercises jurisdiction over facilities and services of local exchange carriers, such as our rural telephone companies, to the extent they are used to provide, originate or terminate interstate or international communications. The FCC has the authority to condition, modify, cancel, terminate or revoke our operating authority for failure to comply with applicable federal laws or FCC rules, regulations and policies. Fines or penalties also may be imposed for any of these violations.\nState regulatory commissions generally exercise jurisdiction over carriers' facilities and services to the extent they are used to provide, originate or terminate intrastate communications. In particular, state regulatory agencies have substantial oversight over interconnection and network access by competitors of our rural telephone companies. In addition, municipalities and other local government agencies regulate the public rights-of-way necessary to install and operate networks. State regulators can sanction our rural telephone companies or revoke our certifications if we violate relevant laws or regulations.\nFCC Matters\nIn general, telecommunications service in rural areas is more costly to provide than service in urban areas. The lower customer density means that switching and other facilities serve fewer customers and loops are typically longer, requiring\ngreater expenditures per customer to build and maintain. By supporting the high-cost of operations in rural markets, Universal Service Fund ( USF\u201d) subsidies promote widely available, quality telephone service at affordable prices in rural areas. Revenues from the federal and certain states' USFs increased $3.2 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the acquisition of Enventis in October 2014.\nIn order for an eligible telecommunications carrier ( ETC\u201d) to receive high-cost support, the USF/Intercarrier Compensation ( ICC\u201d) Transformation Order requires states to certify annually that USF support is used only for the provision, maintenance and upgrading of facilities and services for which the support is intended. States, in turn, require that ETCs file certifications with them as the basis for the state filings with the FCC. Failure to meet the annual data and certification deadlines can result in reduced support to the ETC based on the length of the delay in certification. For calendar year 2013, the California state certification was due to be filed with the FCC on or before October 1, 2012. We were notified in January 2013 that SureWest Communications ( SureWest\u201d) did not submit the required certification to the California Public Utilities Commission ( CPUC\u201d) in time to be included in its October 1, 2012 submission to the FCC. In January 2013, we filed a certification with the CPUC and filed a petition with the FCC for a waiver of the filing deadline for the annual state certification. In February 2013, the CPUC filed a certification with the FCC with respect to SureWest. In October 2013, the Wireline Competition Bureau of the FCC denied our petition for a waiver of the annual certification deadline. In November 2013, we applied for a review of the decision made by the FCC staff by the full Commission. Management is optimistic that the Company may prevail in its application to the Commission and receive USF funding for the period January 1, 2013 through June 30, 2013 based on the change in SureWest's USF filing status caused by the change in the ownership of SureWest, the lack of formal notice by the FCC regarding this change in filing status, the fact that SureWest had a previously filed certification of compliance in effect with the FCC for the two quarters for which USF was withheld and the FCC's past practice of granting waivers to accept late filings in similar situations. However, due to the denial of our petition by the Wireline Competition Bureau and the uncertainty of the collectability of previously recognized revenues, in December 2013 we reversed $3.0 million of previously recognized revenues until such time that the Commission has the opportunity to reach a decision on our application for review.\nOur recently acquired Enventis ILEC properties are cost-based rate of return companies. Historically, under FCC rules governing rate making, these ILECs were required to establish rates for their interstate telecommunications services based on projected demand usage for the various services. We projected our earnings through the use of annual cost separation studies, which utilized estimated total cost information and projected demand usage. Carriers were required to follow FCC rules in the preparation of these annual studies. We determined actual earnings from our interstate rates as actual volumes and costs became known. Effective January 1, 2015, our Enventis ILECs are treated as price cap companies for universal service purposes. In March 2015, we filed a petition for waiver to keep them as rate of return companies for switched and special access. The petition was granted in October 2015. We expect certain adjustments to take place over 24 months as a result of exiting the National Exchange Carrier Association ( NECA\u201d) pool; however, we do not anticipate that they will be material to our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.\nAn order adopted by the FCC in 2011 (the Order\u201d) will significantly impact the amount of support revenue we receive from the USF, Connect America Fund ( CAF\u201d) and ICC. The Order reformed core parts of the USF, broadly recast the existing ICC scheme, established the CAF to replace support revenues provided by the current USF and redirected support from voice services to broadband services. In 2012, CAF Phase I was implemented, which froze USF support to price cap carriers until the FCC implemented a broadband cost model to shift support from voice services to broadband services. The Order also modified the methodology used for ICC traffic exchanged between carriers. The initial phase of ICC reform was effective on July 1, 2012, beginning the transition of our terminating switched access rates to bill-and-keep over a seven year period, and as a result, our network access revenue decreased approximately $1.3 million during 2015.\nIn December 2014, the FCC released a report and order that addressed, among other things, the transition to CAF Phase II funding for price cap carriers and the acceptance criteria for CAF Phase II funding. For companies that accept the CAF Phase II funding, there is a three year transition period in instances in which their current CAF Phase I funding exceeds the CAF Phase II funding. If CAF Phase II funding exceeds CAF Phase I funding, the transitional support is waived and CAF Phase II funding begins immediately. Companies are required to commit to a statewide build out requirement to 10 Mbps downstream and 1 Mbps upstream in funded locations. We accepted the CAF Phase II funding in August 2015. The annual funding under CAF Phase I of $36.6 million will be replaced by annual funding under CAF Phase II of $13.9 million through 2020. In the state of Iowa, where CAF Phase II funding is greater than the CAF Phase I funding, the CAF Phase II funding will be received with a retroactive payment back to January 1, 2015. For all other states, funding under CAF Phase II is less than funding under CAF Phase I. The acceptance of funding at the lower level will transition over a\nthree year period based on the CAF Phase I funding levels at the rates of 75% in the first year, 50% in the second year and 25% in the third year. For the period from August 2015 through December 2015, the Company received and recognized approximately $6.4 million in total CAF Phase II funding, which includes the retroactive payment for Iowa of approximately $0.6 million.\nIn March 2015, the FCC released its net neutrality order which applies to all wireline and wireless providers of broadband internet access services. The net neutrality order addresses several areas that will be regulated and others that are subject to forbearance. The regulations disallow blocking, throttling and paid prioritization by internet service providers. The net neutrality order also requires providers to disclose certain information to consumers on rates, fees, data allowances and packet loss. Finally, it gives the FCC codified enforcement authority and it forbears on certain Title II regulations. We are evaluating the net neutrality order, and we currently do not believe the order will result in any significant changes to the services we provide our customers, nor do we believe it will have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nState Matters\nCalifornia\nIn an ongoing proceeding relating to the New Regulatory Framework, the CPUC adopted Decision 06-08-030 in 2006, which grants carriers broader pricing freedom in the provision of telecommunications services, bundling of services, promotions and customer contracts. This decision adopted a new regulatory framework, the Uniform Regulatory Framework ( URF\u201d), which among other things (i) eliminates price regulation and allows full pricing flexibility for all new and retail services, (ii) allows new forms of bundles and promotional packages of telecommunication services, (iii) allocates all gains and losses from the sale of assets to shareholders and (iv) eliminates almost all elements of rate of return regulation, including the calculation of shareable earnings. In December 2010, the CPUC issued a ruling to initiate a new proceeding to assess whether, or to what extent, the level of competition in the telecommunications industry is sufficient to control prices for the four largest ILECs in the state. Subsequently, the CPUC issued a ruling temporarily deferring the proceeding. When the CPUC may open this proceeding is unclear and on hold at this time. The CPUC's actions in this and future proceedings could lead to new rules and an increase in government regulation. The Company will continue to monitor this matter.\nPennsylvania\nIn 2011, the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission ( PAPUC\u201d) issued an intrastate access reform order reducing intrastate access rates to interstate levels in a three-step process, which began in March 2012. With the release of the FCC order in November 2011, the PAPUC temporarily issued a stay. A final stay was issued in 2012 to implement the FCC ordered intrastate access rate changes. The PAPUC had indicated that it would address state universal funding in 2013, but delayed conducting a proceeding pending any state legislative activity that may occur in the 2015 legislative session. The Company will continue to monitor this matter.\nTexas\nThe Texas Public Utilities Regulatory Act ( PURA\u201d) directs the Public Utilities Commission of Texas ( PUCT\u201d) to adopt and enforce rules requiring local exchange carriers to contribute to a state universal service fund that helps telecommunications providers offer basic local telecommunications service at reasonable rates in high-cost rural areas. The Texas Universal Service Fund is also used to reimburse telecommunications providers for revenues lost by providing lifeline service. Our Texas rural telephone companies receive disbursements from this fund.\nOur Texas ILECs have historically received support from two state funds, the small and rural incumbent local exchange company plan High Cost Fund ( HCF\u201d) and the High Cost Assistance Fund ( HCAF\u201d). The HCF is a line-based fund used to keep local rates low. The rate is applied on all residential lines and up to five single business lines. The amount we receive from the HCAF is a frozen monthly amount that was originally developed to offset high intrastate toll rates.\nIn September 2011, the Texas state legislature passed Senate Bill No. 980/House Bill No. 2603 which, among other things, mandated the PUCT to review the Universal Service Fund and issue recommendations by January 1, 2013 with the intent to effectively reduce the size of the Universal Service Fund. This would be accomplished by implementing an urban floor to offset state funding reductions with a phase-in period of four years. The PUCT recommended that (i) frozen line counts\nbe lifted effective September 1, 2013 and (ii) rural and urban local rate benchmarks be developed. The large company fund review was completed in September 2012 and the PUCT addressed the small fund participants in Docket 41097 Rate Rebalancing ( Docket 41097\u201d), as discussed below.\nIn June 2013, the Texas state legislature passed Senate Bill No. 583 ( SB 583\u201d). The provisions of SB 583 were effective September 1, 2013 and froze HCF and HCAF support for the remainder of 2013. As of January 1, 2014, our annual $1.4 million HCAF support was eliminated and the frozen HCF support returned to funding on a per line basis. In July 2013, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the PUCT on Docket 41097, which was approved by the PUCT in August 2013. In accordance with the provisions of the settlement agreement, the HCF draw will be reduced by approximately $1.2 million annually over a four year period beginning June 1, 2014 through 2018. However, we have the ability to fully offset this reduction with increases to residential rates where market conditions allow, which the Company filed for in April 2014 and implemented in June 2014.\nIn addition, the PUCT is required to develop a needs test for post-2017 funding and has held workshops on various proposals. The PUCT issued its recommendation to the Texas state commissioners in May 2014, which was approved in December 2014. The needs test allows for a one-time disaggregation of line rates from a per line flat rate, then a competitive test must be met to receive funding. The deadline for submission of the needs test is December 31, 2016. We expect to complete the needs test as required and file for continued funding by the 2016 deadline.\nOther Regulatory Matters\nWe are also subject to a number of regulatory proceedings occurring at the federal and state levels that may have a material impact on our operations. The FCC and state commissions have authority to issue rules and regulations related to our business. A number of proceedings are pending or anticipated that are related to such telecommunications issues as competition, interconnection, access charges, intercarrier compensation, broadband deployment, consumer protection and universal service reform. Some proceedings may authorize new services to compete with our existing services. Proceedings that relate to our cable television operations include rulemakings on set top boxes, carriage of programming, industry consolidation and ways to promote additional competition. There are various on-going legal challenges to the scope or validity of FCC orders that have been issued. As a result, it is not yet possible to fully determine the impact of the related FCC rules and regulations on our operations.\nNon-Operating Items\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net of interest income, decreased $2.9 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a reduction in the interest rate for our outstanding senior notes. In June 2015, we issued an additional $300.0 million in 6.50% Senior Notes due 2022, which were used, in part, to redeem our outstanding 10.875% Senior Notes due 2020, as described below. The New Notes were issued as an add-on to the $200.0 million in 6.50% Senior Notes issued in September 2014, the proceeds of which were used, in part, to fund the acquisition of Enventis in October 2014. Interest expense was also reduced in 2015 by declines in non-cash interest expense related to our de-designated interest rate swap agreements and additional financing costs in 2014 related to the bridge loan facility obtained for the Enventis acquisition.\nDuring 2014, interest expense, net of interest income, decreased $3.3 million compared to 2013 primarily due to a reduction in interest expense related to our interest rate swap agreements as a result of the maturity of several agreements during 2013. Interest rates on outstanding borrowings under our Credit Agreement also declined due to the amendment of our Credit Agreement in December 2013. These reductions in interest expense were partially offset by an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of a $200.0 million Senior Note offering in September 2014 used in part to fund the acquisition of Enventis. 2014 also included additional amortization of deferred financing fees of $1.4 million related to the bridge loan facility obtained for the Enventis acquisition.\nIn 2013, interest rate swaps previously designated as cash flow hedges were de-designated as a result of amendments to our credit agreement. These interest rate swap agreements mature on various dates through September 2016. Prior to de-designation, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ( AOCI\u201d). The balance of the unrealized loss included in AOCI as of the date the swaps were de-designated is being amortized to earnings over the remaining term of the swap agreements. Changes in fair value of the de-designated swaps are immediately recognized in earnings as interest expense. During the years ended\nDecember 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, gains of $0.8 million, $1.6 million and $2.2 million, respectively, were recognized as a reduction to interest expense for the change in fair value of the de-designated swaps.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nIn 2014, we redeemed $72.8 million of the original aggregate principal amount of our 10.875% Senior Notes due 2020, as described in the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section below. In connection with the redemption of the 2020 Notes, we paid $84.1 million and recognized a loss of $13.8 million on the partial extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2014. In 2015, we redeemed the remaining $227.2 million of the 2020 Notes for $261.9 million and recognized a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $41.2 million during 2015.\nIn 2013, we amended our Credit Agreement to restate and amend our term loan credit facilities. In connection with entering into the amended and restated credit agreement, we incurred a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $7.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nOther Income\nInvestment income increased $2.2 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in earnings from our wireless partnership interests, which was reduced in part by an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $0.8 million during 2015 as a result of the sale of our equity interest in Central Valley Independent Network, LLC. Other, net decreased $0.6 million compared to 2014 primarily due to additional reserves related to disputed tax assessments recognized in 2015.\nIn 2014, investment income decreased $3.2 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to lower earnings from our wireless partnership interests. Other, net decreased $0.5 million compared to 2013 due to bond solicitation fees of $0.5 million, and the sale of an office facility and other related assets in Pennsylvania that resulted in a non-cash loss of $0.8 million. Decreases were partially offset by a tentative settlement agreement of $0.9 million reached in a legal dispute in the prior year.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes decreased $10.2 million in 2015 compared to 2014. Our effective rate was 131.9% for 2015 compared to 45.8% for 2014. In 2015, we placed additional valuation allowances on state NOL and state tax credit carryforwards of $3.9 million and $1.1 million, respectively, and related deferred tax asset of $0.2 million and $0.7 million, respectively. We also recorded a net increase of $1.9 million to our net state deferred tax liabilities and a corresponding increase to our state tax expense due to changes in state deferred income tax rates. In 2014, we released the full $1.5 million valuation allowance and related deferred tax asset of $0.5 million maintained against the Federal NOL carryforwards subject to separate return limitation year restrictions and placed a valuation allowance on the state tax credit carryforwards of $0.5 million and related deferred tax asset of $0.3 million. The acquisition of Enventis on October 16, 2014 resulted in changes to our unitary state filings and correspondingly our state deferred income taxes. These changes resulted in a net increase of $2.1 million to our net state deferred tax liabilities and a corresponding increase to our state tax. In addition, we incurred non-deductible transaction costs in relation to the acquisition that resulted in an increase to our tax provision of $0.7 million. Exclusive of these adjustments, our effective tax rate for 2015 would have been approximately 7.9% compared to 36.6% for 2014. The 2015 effective tax rate differed from the federal and state statutory rates primarily due to state tax credits and differences in allocable income for the Company's state tax filings.\nIncome taxes decreased $4.5 million in 2014 compared to 2013. Our effective rate was 45.8% for 2014 compared to 36.9% for 2013. In 2014, we released the full $1.5 million valuation allowance and related deferred tax asset of $0.5 million maintained against the Federal NOL carryforwards subject to separate return limitation year restrictions and placed a valuation allowance on the state tax credit carryforwards of $0.5 million and related deferred tax asset of $0.3 million. The acquisition of Enventis on October 16, 2014 resulted in changes to our unitary state filings and correspondingly our state deferred income taxes. These changes resulted in a net increase of $2.1 million to our net state deferred tax liabilities and a corresponding increase to our state tax. In addition, we incurred non-deductible transaction costs in relation to the acquisition that resulted in an increase to our tax provision of $0.7 million. During 2013, we recognized $1.2 million of our previously unrecognized tax benefits, which resulted in a decrease to our tax expense of $0.8 million, due to the expiration of a state statute of limitations. We also recognized approximately $0.7 million of tax expense during 2013 to adjust our 2012 provision to match our 2012 returns. Exclusive of these adjustments, our effective tax rate for 2014 would have been approximately 36.6% compared to 37.1% for 2013.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to the results reported in accordance with US GAAP, we also use certain non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to evaluate operating performance and to facilitate the comparison of our historical results and trends. These financial measures are not a measure of financial performance under US GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income as a measure of performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. They are not, on their own, necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as determined in accordance with GAAP. The calculation of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP are provided below.\nEBITDA is defined as net earnings before interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is comprised of EBITDA, adjusted for certain items as permitted or required under our credit facility as described in the reconciliations below. These measures are a common measure of operating performance in the telecommunications industry and are useful, with other data, as a means to evaluate our ability to fund our estimated uses of cash.\nThe following tables are a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nTable 74: <table> <tr>

been funded from cash flows generated from our business and borrowings under our credit facilities. We expect that our future operating requirements will continue to be funded from cash flows from operating activities, existing cash and cash equivalents, and, if needed, from borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our ability to obtain future external financing. We anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion\nof our cash flow to fund capital expenditures, meet scheduled payments of long-term debt, make dividend payments and to invest in future business opportunities.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows:\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash flows provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating activities:\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContinuing operations\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n219,179 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n187,785 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n168,530 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDiscontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4,174) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvesting activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContinuing operations\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(119,540) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(246,861) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(107,436) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDiscontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,331 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinancing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContinuing operations\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(90,440) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n60,204 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(71,554) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncrease (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,199 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,128 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(12,303) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $219.2 million in 2015, an increase of $31.4 million as compared to 2014. Cash provided by operating activities increased primarily as a result of the additional cash flows provided by the addition of the Enventis operations as well as an increase in cash distributions from our wireless partnerships in 2015. These increases were offset in part by changes in working capital primarily due to the timing in receipts for accounts receivable, a decline in advance billings related to equipment sales and a decline in accounts payable related to the timing in payments to suppliers.\nCash Flows Used In Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $119.5 million during 2015, a decrease of $127.3 million from 2014 primarily due to cash used for the acquisition of Enventis in 2014.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures continue to be our primary recurring investing activity and were $133.9 million in 2015, an increase of $24.9 million compared to 2014. Capital expenditures for 2016 are expected to be $125.0 million to $130.0 million, of which approximately 63% is planned for success-based capital projects for consumer, commercial and carrier initiatives. Capital expenditures in 2016 and subsequent years will depend on various factors, including competition, changes in technology, regulatory changes and the timing in the deployment of new services. We expect to continue to invest in existing and new services and the expansion of our fiber network in order to retain and acquire more customers through a broader set of products and an expanded network footprint.\nAcquisition of Enventis\nIn 2014, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Enventis for shares of our common stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares. The purchase price consisted of cash and the repayment of debt of $139.6 million, net of cash acquired, and the issuance of shares of the Company's common stock valued at $257.7 million. The funds required to repay Enventis' outstanding debt was financed in part with the sale of $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Senior Notes due 2022, as described below.\nCash Flows Provided by (Used In) Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations consists primarily of our proceeds and principal payments on long-term borrowings and the payment of dividends.\nLong-term Debt\nThe following table summarizes our indebtedness as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMaturity Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRate(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n6.50% Senior Notes, net of discount\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n495,107 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOctober 1, 2022\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n6.50 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTerm loan 4, net of discount\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n888,460 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 23, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLIBOR plus 3.25\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevolving loan\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 23, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLIBOR plus 3.00\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapital leases\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,580 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMay 31, 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.36 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n% (2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,401,147 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAt December 31, 2015, the 1-month London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) applicable to our borrowings was 0.42%.

The Credit Agreement consists of a $75.0 million revolving credit facility and initial term loans in the aggregate amount of $910.0 million ( Term 4\u201d). The Credit Agreement also includes an incremental term loan facility which provides the ability to request to borrow up to $300.0 million of incremental term loans subject to certain terms and conditions. Borrowings under the senior secured credit facility are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, with the exception of Consolidated Communications of Illinois Company (formerly known as Illinois Consolidated Telephone Company) and our majority-owned subsidiary, East Texas Fiber Line Incorporated.\nThe Term 4 loan was issued in an original aggregate principal amount of $910.0 million with a maturity date of December 23, 2020. The Term 4 loan contains an original issuance discount of $4.6 million, which is being amortized over the term of the loan. The Term 4 loan requires quarterly principal payments of $2.3 million, which commenced March 31, 2014, and has an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.25% subject to a 1.00% LIBOR floor.\nOur revolving credit facility has a maturity date of December 23, 2018 and an applicable margin (at our election) of between 2.50% and 3.25% for LIBOR-based borrowings or between 1.50% and 2.25% for alternate base rate borrowings, depending on our leverage ratio. Based on our leverage ratio at December 31, 2015, the borrowing margin for the next three month period ending March 31, 2016 will be at a weighted-average margin of 3.00% for a LIBOR-based loan or 2.00% for an alternate base rate loan. The applicable borrowing margin for the revolving credit facility is adjusted quarterly to reflect the leverage ratio from the prior quarter-end. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, borrowings of $10.0 million and $39.0 million, respectively, were outstanding under the revolving credit facility. A stand-by letter of credit of $1.6 million, issued in connection with the Company's insurance coverage, was outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2015. The stand-by letter of credit is renewable annually and reduces the borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2015, $63.4 million was available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility.\nThe weighted-average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under our credit facility was 4.24% and 4.20% at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Interest is payable at least quarterly.\nNet proceeds from asset sales exceeding certain thresholds, to the extent not reinvested, are required to be used to repay loans outstanding under the credit agreement.\nCredit Agreement Covenant Compliance\nThe credit agreement contains various provisions and covenants, including, among other items, restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, incur additional indebtedness, and issue capital stock. We have agreed to maintain certain financial ratios, including interest coverage and total net leverage ratios, all as defined in the credit agreement. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the credit agreement covenants.\nIn general, our credit agreement restricts our ability to pay dividends to the amount of our Available Cash as defined in our credit agreement. As of December 31, 2015 and including the $19.6 million dividend declared in November 2015 and paid on February 1, 2016, we had $245.9 million in dividend availability under the credit facility covenant.\nUnder our credit agreement, if our total net leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement), as of the end of any fiscal quarter, is greater than 5.10:1.00, we will be required to suspend dividends on our common stock unless otherwise permitted by an exception for dividends that may be paid from the portion of proceeds of any sale of equity not used to fund acquisitions, or make other investments. During any dividend suspension period, we will be required to repay debt in an amount equal to 50.0% of any increase in Available Cash, among other things. In addition, we will not be permitted to pay dividends if an event of default under the credit agreement has occurred and is continuing. Among other things, it will be an event of default if our total net leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter is greater than 5.25:1.00 and less than 2.25:1.00, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, our total net leverage ratio under the credit agreement was 4.23:1.00, and our interest coverage ratio was 4.12:1.00.\nSenior Notes\n6.50% Senior Notes due 2022\nOn June 8, 2015, we completed an offering of $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Senior Notes due 2022. The New Notes were priced at 98.26% of par with a yield to maturity of 6.80% and resulted in total gross proceeds of approximately $294.8 million, excluding accrued interest. The discount and deferred debt issuance costs of $4.5 million incurred in connection with the issuance of the New Notes are being amortized using the effective interest method over the term of the notes. The net proceeds from the issuance of the New Notes were used, in part, to redeem the remaining $227.2 million of our original $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 10.875% Senior Notes due 2020 and to pay related fees and expenses and to reduce the amount outstanding on the revolving credit facility. In connection with the redemption of the 2020 Notes, we paid $261.9 million and recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $41.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe New Notes were issued as additional notes under the same indenture pursuant to which the $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Senior Notes due 2022 were previously issued on September 18, 2014. The Existing Notes were priced at par, which resulted in total gross proceeds of $200.0 million. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Existing Notes were used to finance the acquisition of Enventis, including related fees and expenses, and to repay the existing indebtedness of Enventis. A portion of the net proceeds, together with cash on hand and borrowings from the revolving credit facility, were also used to redeem $72.8 million of the original aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes in 2014.\nThe 2022 Notes mature on October 1, 2022 and interest is payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year. Consolidated Communications, Inc. ( CCI\u201d) is the primary obligor under the 2022 Notes, and we and certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the 2022 Notes. The 2022 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company.\nOn October 16, 2015, we completed an exchange offer to register all of the 2022 Notes under the Securities Act. The terms of the registered notes are substantially identical to those of the 2022 Notes prior to the exchange, except that the 2022 Notes are now registered under the Securities Act and the transfer restrictions and registration rights previously applicable to the original 2022 Notes do not apply to the registered 2022 Notes. The exchange offer did not impact the aggregate principal amount or the remaining terms of the 2022 Notes outstanding.\nSenior Notes Covenant Compliance\nSubject to certain exceptions and qualifications, the indenture governing the 2022 Notes contains customary covenants that, among other things, limits CCI's and its restricted subsidiaries' ability to: incur additional debt or issue certain preferred stock; pay dividends or make other distributions on capital stock or prepay subordinated indebtedness; purchase or redeem any equity interests; make investments; create liens; sell assets; enter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments by restricted subsidiaries; consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its assets; engage in transactions with its affiliates; or enter into any sale and leaseback transactions. The indenture also contains customary events of default.\nAmong other matters, the 2022 Notes indenture provides that CCI may not pay dividends or make other restricted payments, as defined in the indenture, if its total net leverage ratio is 4.75:1.00 or greater. This ratio is calculated differently than the comparable ratio under the Credit Agreement; among other differences, it takes into account, on a pro forma basis, synergies expected to be achieved as a result of certain acquisitions not yet reflected in historical results. At December 31, 2015, this ratio was 4.33:1.00. If this ratio is met, dividends and other restricted payments may be made from cumulative consolidated cash flow since April 1, 2012, less 1.75 times fixed charges, less dividends and other restricted payments made since May 30, 2012. Dividends may be paid and other restricted payments may also be made from a basket\u201d of $50.0 million, none of which has been used to date, and pursuant to other exceptions identified in the indenture. Since dividends of $253.1 million have been paid since May 30, 2012, including the quarterly dividend declared in November 2015 and paid on February 1, 2016, there was $351.5 million of the $604.6 million of cumulative consolidated cash flow since May 30, 2012 available to pay dividends as of December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with all terms, conditions and covenants under the indenture governing the 2022 Notes.\nCapital Leases\nWe lease certain facilities and equipment under various capital leases which expire between 2015 and 2021. As of December 31, 2015, the present value of the minimum remaining lease commitments was approximately $7.6 million, of which $1.8 million was due and payable within the next twelve months. The leases require total remaining rental payments of $9.4 million as of December 31, 2015, of which $4.3 million will be paid to LATEL LLC, a related party entity.\nDividends\nWe paid $78.2 million and $62.3 million in dividend payments to shareholders during 2015 and 2014, respectively. In November 2015, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.38738 per common share, which was paid on February 1, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business on January 15, 2016. In addition, on February 19, 2016, our board of directors declared its next quarterly dividend of $0.38738 per common share, which is payable on May 2, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business on April 15, 2016. Our current annual dividend rate is approximately $1.55 per share.\nThe cash required to fund dividend payments is in addition to our other expected cash needs, which we expect to fund with cash flows from our operations. In addition, we expect we will have sufficient availability under our revolving credit facility to fund dividend payments in addition to any expected fluctuations in working capital and other cash needs, although we do not intend to borrow under this facility to pay dividends.\nWe believe that our dividend policy will limit, but not preclude, our ability to grow. If we continue paying dividends at the level currently anticipated under our dividend policy, we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash, and may need to seek refinancing, to fund a material expansion of our business, including any significant acquisitions or to pursue growth opportunities requiring capital expenditures significantly beyond our current expectations. In addition, because we expect a significant portion of cash available will be distributed to holders of common stock under our dividend policy, our ability to pursue any material expansion of our business will depend more than it otherwise would on our ability to obtain third-party financing.\nSufficiency of Cash Resources\nThe following table sets forth selected information regarding our financial condition.\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In thousands, except for ratio)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15,878 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,679 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWorking capital (deficit)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(17,892) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(21,930) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCurrent ratio\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.88 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.86 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur net working capital position improved $4.0 million as of December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of an increase in cash and cash equivalents due in part to a decline in accounts receivable and additional cash distributions from our wireless partnerships in the current year. Income tax receivable also increased primarily due to the loss on the extinguishment of debt recognized in 2015. The improvement in working capital was also due to a decline in current liabilities as a result of a decrease in accrued compensation at December 31, 2015. The change in working capital was also impacted by the adoption as of December 31, 2015 of Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17 ( ASU 2015-17\u201d),\nBalance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet. The adoption of this guidance resulted in the reclassification of approximately $12.4 million of net deferred tax assets from current assets to noncurrent net deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2015. Prior period amounts were not retrospectively adjusted.\nOur most significant use of funds in 2016 is expected to be for: (i) dividend payments of between $78.0 million and $80.0 million; (ii) interest payments on our indebtedness of between $73.0 million and $75.0 million and principal payments on debt of $9.1 million; and (iii) capital expenditures of between $125.0 million and $130.0 million. In the future, our ability to use cash may be limited by our other expected uses of cash, including our dividend policy, and our ability to incur additional debt will be limited by our existing and future debt agreements.\nWe believe that cash flows from operating activities, together with our existing cash and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient for at least the next twelve months to fund our current anticipated uses of cash. After that, our ability to fund these expected uses of cash and to comply with the financial covenants under our debt agreements will depend on the results of future operations, performance and cash flow. Our ability to fund these expected uses from the results of future operations will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, regulatory, legislative and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe may be unable to access the cash flows of our subsidiaries since certain of our subsidiaries are parties to credit or other borrowing agreements, or subject to statutory or regulatory restrictions, that restrict the payment of dividends or making intercompany loans and investments, and those subsidiaries are likely to continue to be subject to such restrictions and prohibitions for the foreseeable future. In addition, future agreements that our subsidiaries may enter into governing the terms of indebtedness may restrict our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends or advance cash in any other manner to us.\nTo the extent that our business plans or projections change or prove to be inaccurate, we may require additional financing or require financing sooner than we currently anticipate. Sources of additional financing may include commercial bank borrowings, other strategic debt financing, sales of nonstrategic assets, vendor financing or the private or public sales of equity and debt securities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future, that anticipated revenue growth will be realized, or that future borrowings or equity issuances will be available in amounts sufficient to provide adequate sources of cash to fund our expected uses of cash. Failure to obtain adequate financing, if necessary, could require us to significantly reduce our operations or level of capital expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the results of operations.\nSurety Bonds\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into surety, performance, and similar bonds as required by certain jurisdictions in which we provide services. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $3.8 million of these bonds outstanding.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2015, our contractual obligations were as follows:\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess than\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1 - 3\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n3 - 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,100 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n28,200 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n864,500 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n500,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,401,800 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest on long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n70,502 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n139,843 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n137,612 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n65,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n412,957 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest rate swaps (2)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,222 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,058 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,280 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapital leases\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,485 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,494 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,091 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,440 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating leases\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,219 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,698 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,613 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,532 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26,062 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUnconditional purchase obligations:\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUnrecorded (3)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n56,729 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n34,249 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16,070 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,539 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n121,587 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRecorded (4)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n40,398 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n40,398 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPension funding\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,882 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,882 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInterest on long-term debt includes amounts due on fixed and variable rate debt.

Contributions are intended to provide for benefits attributed to service to date. Our funding policy is to contribute annually an actuarially determined amount consistent with applicable federal income tax regulations.\nThe cost to maintain our Pension Plans and future funding requirements are affected by several factors including the expected return on investment of the assets held by the Pension Plan, changes in the discount rate used to calculate pension expense and the amortization of unrecognized gains and losses. Returns generated on Plan assets have historically funded a significant portion of the benefits paid under the Pension Plans. For 2015, the estimated long-term rate of return of Plan assets was 8.00%. As of January 1, 2016, we estimate that the long-term rate of return of Plan assets will be 7.75%. The Pension Plans invest in marketable equity securities which are exposed to changes in the financial markets. If the financial markets experience a downturn and returns fall below our estimate, we could be required to make a material contribution to the Pension Plan, which could adversely affect our cash flows from operations.\nNet pension and post-retirement (benefit)/costs were $(2.2) million, $(5.5) million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We contributed $12.2 million, $11.1 million and $11.5 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively to our pension plans. For our other post-retirement plans, we contributed $3.0 million, $2.7 million and $2.8 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In 2016, we expect to make contributions totaling approximately $0.3 million to our non-qualified supplemental retirement plans and $3.6 million to our other post-retirement benefit plans. We do not expect to contribute to our qualified defined pension plans in 2016. Our contribution amounts meet the minimum funding requirements as set forth in employee benefit and tax laws. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion regarding our pension and other post-retirement plans.\nIncome Taxes\nThe timing of cash payments for income taxes, which is governed by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing jurisdictions, will differ from the timing of recording tax expense and deferred income taxes, which are reported in accordance with GAAP. For example, tax laws in effect regarding accelerated or bonus\u201d depreciation for tax reporting resulted in less cash payments than the GAAP tax expense. Acceleration of tax deductions could eventually result in situations where cash payments will exceed GAAP tax expense.\nRelated Party Transactions\nA portion of the 2020 Notes were sold to accredited investors consisting of certain members of the Company's Board of Directors or a trust of which a director is the beneficiary ( related parties\u201d). In May 2012, the related parties purchased $10.8 million of the 2020 Notes on the same terms available to other investors, except that the related parties were not entitled to registration rights. In 2015, the 2020 Notes were fully redeemed and we paid an early redemption premium of $1.5 million and recognized interest expense of approximately $0.7 million, $1.3 million and $1.2 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, in the aggregate for the 2020 Notes purchased by related parties. In September 2014, $5.0 million of the 2022 Notes were sold to a trust, the beneficiary of which is a member of the Company's Board of Directors and in 2015 we recognized approximately $0.3 million in interest expense for the 2022 Notes purchased by the related party.\nIn December 2010, we entered into new lease agreements with LATEL LLC ( LATEL\u201d) for the occupancy of three buildings on a triple net lease basis. Each of the three lease agreements have a maturity date of May 31, 2021, and have been accounted for as capital leases. Each of the three lease agreements have two five-year options to extend the terms of\nthe lease after the expiration date. Our Board of Directors member, Richard A. Lumpkin, and his immediate family had a beneficial ownership interest of 66.7% and 72.4% in 2015 and 2014, respectively, of LATEL, directly or through Agracel, Inc. ( Agracel\u201d). Agracel is real estate investment company of which Mr. Lumpkin, together with his family, had a beneficial interest of 33.5% and 44.7% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Agracel is the sole managing member and 50% owner of LATEL. In addition, Mr. Lumpkin is a director of Agracel. The three leases require total rental payments to LATEL of approximately $7.9 million over the term of the leases. The carrying value of the capital leases at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $3.0 million and $3.4 million, respectively. We recognized $0.4 million in interest expense in 2015 and $0.5 million in interest expense in each of 2014 and 2013 and amortization expense of $0.4 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013 related to the capitalized leases.\nMr. Lumpkin also has a minority ownership interest in First Mid-Illinois Bancshares, Inc. ( First Mid-Illinois\u201d). We provide telecommunications products and services to First Mid-Illinois at standard prices as to other strategic business customers and we received approximately $0.8 million in 2015 and $0.5 million in each of 2014 and 2013 for these services.\nRegulatory Matters\nAs discussed in the Regulatory Matters\u201d section above, in December 2014, the FCC released a report and order that significantly impacts the amount of support revenue we receive from the USF, CAF and ICC by redirecting support from voice services to broadband services. Our annual funding under CAF Phase I of $36.6 million will be replaced by annual funding under CAF Phase II of $13.9 million through 2020. In the state of Iowa, where CAF Phase II funding is greater than the CAF Phase I funding, the CAF Phase II funding will be received with a retroactive payment back to January 1, 2015. For all other states, funding under CAF Phase II is less than funding under CAF Phase I. The acceptance of funding at the lower level will transition over a three year period, beginning in August 2015, at the rates of 75% of the CAF Phase I funding level in the first year, 50% in the second year and 25% in the third year. For the period from August 2015 through December 2015, the Company received and recognized approximately $6.4 million in total CAF Phase II funding, which includes the retroactive payment for Iowa of approximately $0.6 million.\nThe Order also modifies the methodology used for ICC traffic exchanged between carriers. As a result of implementing the provisions of the Order, our network access revenue decreased approximately $1.3 million during 2015. We anticipate that network access revenue will continue to decline as a result of the Order through 2018 by as much as $1.9 million, $4.8 million and $6.8 million in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.\nIn accordance with the provisions of SB 583, as discussed in the Regulatory Matters\u201d section above, our annual $1.4 million Texas HCAF support was eliminated effective January 1, 2014. In addition, in accordance with the provisions of the settlement agreement reached with the PUCT, the HCF draw will be reduced by approximately $1.2 million annually over a four year period beginning June 1, 2014 through 2018. However, we have the ability to fully offset this reduction with increases to residential rates where market conditions allow, which the Company filed for and implemented in 2014 and 2015.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies and estimates are discussed in the Notes to our consolidated financial statements. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management's application of our accounting policies. Our judgments are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, because future events and the related effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from our estimates and assumptions and such differences could be material. Management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and tradenames are intangible assets that are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We evaluate the carrying value of our indefinite-lived assets, tradenames and goodwill, as of November 30 of each year.\nGoodwill\nAs discussed more fully in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, goodwill is not amortized but instead evaluated for impairment annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate potential impairment, for impairment using a preliminary qualitative assessment and two-step quantitative process, if deemed necessary. The evaluation of goodwill may first include a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Events and circumstances integrated into the qualitative assessment process include a combination of macroeconomic conditions affecting equity and credit markets, significant changes to the cost structure, overall financial performance and other relevant events affecting the reporting unit. A company is permitted to skip the qualitative assessment at its election, and proceed to step one of the quantitative test, which we chose to do in 2015.\nFunctional management within the organization evaluates the operations of our single reporting unit on a consolidated basis rather than at a geographic level or on any other component basis. In general, product managers and cost managers are responsible for managing costs and services across territories rather than treating the territories as separate business units. The operations of our Illinois, Texas, Pennsylvania, California, Kansas and Missouri properties share network operations monitoring call routing and research and development costs and share remittance, customer service and billing systems. In connection with our recent acquisition of Enventis in October 2014, the functional realignment occurred shortly after close. The continued integration of the various systems and processes in place at Enventis will occur over the next several quarters. All of the properties are managed at a functional level. In addition, the Pennsylvania territories receive their video programming from a video head-end located in the Illinois territory, and all of the networks provide redundancy. As a result, we evaluate the operations for all our service territories as a single reporting unit.\nAt our November 30, 2015 assessment date, the carrying value of goodwill was $764.6 million.\nThe estimated fair value of our single reporting unit is determined using a combination of market-based approaches and a discounted cash flow ( DCF\u201d) model. The assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are based upon a combination of historical results and trends, new industry developments, future cash flow projections, as well as relevant comparable company earnings multiples for the market-based approaches. Such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. The market-based approaches used in the valuation effort includes the publicly-traded market capitalization, guideline public companies, and guideline transaction methods. We use a weighting of the results derived from the valuation approaches to estimate the fair value of the single reporting unit. Key assumptions used in the DCF model include the following:\nTable 88: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncash flow assumptions regarding investment in network facilities, distribution channels and customer base (the assumptions underlying these inputs are based upon a combination of historical results and trends, new industry developments and the Company's business plans);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.0% weighted average cost of capital based on comparable public companies and adjusting for risks unique to our business and the cash flow assumptions utilized in the analysis; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.0% terminal growth rate.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt November 30, 2015, the fair value of the single reporting unit's total equity was estimated at approximately $1.3 billion on a control basis, and the associated carrying value of its equity was $269.8 million. For all valuation methods used, the fair value of equity exceeds its carrying value. The use of different estimates or assumptions in the DCF model could result in a different fair value conclusion. As a sensitivity calculation, if the discount rate in our DCF model was increased 1.0 percentage point from 6.0% to 7.0%, the fair value would decrease from approximately $1.3 billion to approximately $1.2 billion, which would not result in an impairment of goodwill, assuming there are no changes to the market-based approaches used in the valuation. Assuming the discount rate in our DCF model was increased 2.0 percentage points, the terminal growth rate decreased by 0.05 percentage point, and each of the market-based valuation approaches decreased in\nvalue by 5%, the fair value of approximately $1.3 billion would decrease by approximately $314.0 million to approximately $995.0 million, which would not result in an impairment of goodwill. As discussed above, the other market-based approaches are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. Negative changes relating to the Company's operations could result in potential impairment of goodwill. Changes in the overall weighting of the DCF model and the market-based approach valuation models may also impact the resulting fair value and could result in potential impairment of goodwill.\nTradenames\nAs discussed more fully in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, tradenames are generally not amortized but instead evaluated annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate potential impairment, for impairment using a preliminary qualitative assessment and two-step process, if deemed necessary. We estimate the fair value of our tradenames using DCFs based on a relief from royalty method. If the fair value of our tradenames was less than the carrying amount, we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the tradename. In accordance with Accounting Codification Standard 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other ( ASC 350\u201d) separately recorded indefinite-lived intangible assets, whether acquired or internally developed, shall be combined into a single unit of accounting for purposes of testing impairment if they are operated as a single asset and, as such, are essentially inseparable from one another. An indefinite-lived intangible asset may need to be removed from the accounting unit if it is disposed of, the accounting unit is reconsidered or one or more of the separate indefinite-lived intangible asset(s) within the accounting unit is now considered finite-lived rather than indefinite-lived. We perform our impairment testing of our tradenames as single units of accounting based on their use in our business.\nThe carrying value of our tradenames, excluding any finite lived tradenames, was $10.6 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we completed our annual impairment test using a DCF methodology based on a relief from royalty method and determined that there was no impairment of our tradename.\nRevenue recognition\nWe recognize certain revenues pursuant to various cost recovery programs from federal and state USF. Revenues are calculated based on our estimates and assumptions regarding various financial data, including operating expenses, taxes and investment in property, plant and equipment. Non-financial data estimates are also utilized, including projected demand usage and detailed network information. We must also make estimates of the jurisdictional separation of this data to assign current financial and operating data to the interstate or intrastate jurisdiction. These estimates are finalized in future periods as actual data becomes available to complete the separation studies. We have historically collected revenues recognized through these programs; however, adjustments to estimated revenues in future periods are possible. These adjustments could be necessitated by adverse regulatory developments with respect to these subsidies and revenue sharing arrangements, changes in allowable rates of return and the determination of recoverable costs, or decreases in the availability of funds in the programs due to increased participation by other carriers.\nDerivatives\nWe use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage the risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and to convert a portion of future cash flows associated with the interest to be paid on our credit facility from a floating rate to a fixed rate. All derivative financial statements are recognized in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. For the derivative financial instruments designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of interest expense in the period in which the hedged item affects earnings. Any ineffectiveness is recognized immediately in earnings. For derivative financial instruments not designated as a cash flow hedge or have been determined to no longer be effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item and have been de-designated, then the changes in the market value of these instruments are recorded in the statement of operations as a component of interest expense.\nOur interest rate swaps are measured using valuation models which rely on quoted market prices and observable market data of similar instruments. The valuation models require estimates of future interest rates and judgments about the future credit worthiness of the Company and each counterparty over the terms of the contracts.\nIncome taxes\nOur current and deferred income taxes and associated valuation allowances are impacted by events and transactions arising in the normal course of business as well as in connection with the adoption of new accounting standards, acquisitions of businesses and non-recurring items. Assessment of the appropriate amount and classification of income taxes is dependent on several factors, including estimates of the timing and realization of deferred income tax assets and the timing of income tax payments. Actual amounts may materially differ from these estimates as a result of changes in tax laws as well as unanticipated future transactions impacting related income tax balances. We account for tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in accordance with the accounting guidance applicable for uncertainty in income taxes, which requires the use of a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.\nPension and postretirement benefits\nThe amounts recognized in our financial statements for pension and postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing several critical assumptions. We make significant assumptions in regards to our pension and postretirement plans, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate used to value the periodic pension expense and liabilities, future salary increases and actuarial assumptions relating to mortality rates and healthcare trend rates. Changes in these estimates and other factors could significantly impact our benefit cost and obligations to maintain pension and postretirement plans.\nOur pension investment strategy is to maximize long-term returns on invested plan assets while minimizing the risk of volatility. Accordingly, we target our allocation percentage at approximately 60% in equity funds, with the remainder in fixed income and cash equivalents. Our assumed rate considers this investment mix as well as past trends. We used an expected long-term rate of return of 8.00% in 2015 and 2014. As of January 1, 2016, we estimate that the long-term rate of return of pension plan assets will be 7.75%.\nIn determining the appropriate discount rate, we consider the current yields on high-quality corporate fixed-income investments with maturities that correspond to the expected duration of our pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations. For our 2015 and 2014 projected benefit obligations, we used a discount rate of 4.76% and 4.27%, respectively, for our pension plans and 4.61% and 4.11%, respectively, for our other postretirement plans.\nA one percentage-point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have the following effects on net periodic benefit cost:\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n1-Percentage-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1-Percentage-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPoint Increase\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPoint Decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(2,420) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,133 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information regarding the impact of certain recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 Business Description & Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated Financial Statements included in this report in Part II -Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d.", "item_7_truncated": "Cash Flows Provided by (Used In) Financing Activities\nIn order for an eligible telecommunications carrier ( ETC\u201d) to receive high-cost support, the USF/Intercarrier Compensation ( ICC\u201d) Transformation Order requires states to certify annually that USF support is used only for the provision, maintenance and upgrading of facilities and services for which the support is intended. States, in turn, require that ETCs file certifications with them as the basis for the state filings with the FCC. Failure to meet the annual data and certification deadlines can result in reduced support to the ETC based on the length of the delay in certification. For calendar year 2013, the California state certification was due to be filed with the FCC on or before October 1, 2012. We were notified in January 2013 that SureWest Communications ( SureWest\u201d) did not submit the required certification to the California Public Utilities Commission ( CPUC\u201d) in time to be included in its October 1, 2012 submission to the FCC. In January 2013, we filed a certification with the CPUC and filed a petition with the FCC for a waiver of the filing deadline for the annual state certification. In February 2013, the CPUC filed a certification with the FCC with respect to SureWest. In October 2013, the Wireline Competition Bureau of the FCC denied our petition for a waiver of the annual certification deadline. In November 2013, we applied for a review of the decision made by the FCC staff by the full Commission. Management is optimistic that the Company may prevail in its application to the Commission and receive USF funding for the period January 1, 2013 through June 30, 2013 based on the change in SureWest's USF filing status caused by the change in the ownership of SureWest, the lack of formal notice by the FCC regarding this change in filing status, the fact that SureWest had a previously filed certification of compliance in effect with the FCC for the two quarters for which USF was withheld and the FCC's past practice of granting waivers to accept late filings in similar situations. However, due to the denial of our petition by the Wireline Competition Bureau and the uncertainty of the collectability of previously recognized revenues, in December 2013 we reversed $3.0 million of previously recognized revenues until such time that the Commission has the opportunity to reach a decision on our application for review.\n (2) Weighted-average rate. \nBroadband services include revenue from residential customers for subscriptions to our VoIP, data and video products.

A portion of the net proceeds, together with cash on hand and borrowings from the revolving credit facility, were also used to redeem $72.8 million of the original aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes in 2014.\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess than\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1 - 3\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n3 - 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,100 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n28,200 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n864,500 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n500,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,401,800 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest on long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n70,502 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n139,843 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n137,612 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n65,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n412,957 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest rate swaps (2)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,222 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,058 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,280 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapital leases\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,485 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,494 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,091 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,440 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating leases\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,219 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,698 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,613 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,532 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26,062 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUnconditional purchase obligations:\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUnrecorded (3)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n56,729 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n34,249 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16,070 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,539 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n121,587 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRecorded (4)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n40,398 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n40,398 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPension funding\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,882 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,882 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative costs increased $5.2 million during 2014 compared to 2013 primarily as a result of the addition of the operations for Enventis in 2014, which accounted for $7.2 million of the annual increase. Excluding Enventis, selling, general and administrative expense decreased $2.0 million due to a decline in professional fees for legal and billing services and a reduction in pension costs in 2014. These savings were offset in part by growth in our commercial sales force as a result of the expansion of our commercial services in the Dallas market in 2014. Bad debt expense also increased due to recoveries recognized in 2013.\nOn October 16, 2015, we completed an exchange offer to register all of the 2022 Notes under the Securities Act. The terms of the registered notes are substantially identical to those of the 2022 Notes prior to the exchange, except that the 2022 Notes are now registered under the Securities Act and the transfer restrictions and registration rights previously applicable to the original 2022 Notes do not apply to the registered 2022 Notes. The exchange offer did not impact the aggregate principal amount or the remaining terms of the 2022 Notes outstanding.\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In thousands, except for ratio)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15,878 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,679 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWorking capital (deficit)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(17,892) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(21,930) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCurrent ratio\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.88 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.86 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of services and products increased $85.7 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the addition of the operations for Enventis during 2014, which accounted for $80.3 million of the increase. Video programming costs also increased $5.0 million as costs per program channel continue to rise. Video programming costs are impacted by license fees charged by cable networks, the amount and quality of the content we provide and the number of video subscribers we serve. We anticipate that programming costs will continue to increase due to the rising cost of license fees and as we add additional content and offer video content to various platforms. Network access costs also increased as a result of growth in carrier and wireless backhaul services. However, these increases were partially offset by a decline in employee costs due to a reduction in headcount.\nIn connection with the acquisition, in September 2014, we completed an offering of $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.50% senior notes due 2022 (the Existing Notes\u201d). The net proceeds from the issuance of the Existing Notes were used to finance the acquisition of Enventis, including related fees and expenses, and to pay the existing indebtedness of Enventis. A portion of the proceeds, together with cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility, was also used to redeem $72.8 million of our $300.0 million original aggregate principal amount of 10.875% Senior Notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes\u201d), as described in the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section below.\nIncome Taxes\n\nWe paid $78.2 million and $62.3 million in dividend payments to shareholders during 2015 and 2014, respectively. In November 2015, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.38738 per common share, which was paid on February 1, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business on January 15, 2016. In addition, on February 19, 2016, our board of directors declared its next quarterly dividend of $0.38738 per common share, which is payable on May 2, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business on April 15, 2016. Our current annual dividend rate is approximately $1.55 per share.\nIn general, telecommunications service in rural areas is more costly to provide than service in urban areas.

In addition, the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Consolidated Communications Holdings, Inc. ( Consolidated\u201d, the Company\u201d, we\u201d or our\u201d). MD&A should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements ( Notes\u201d) as of and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNetwork Access Services\nIssuance of Additional Senior Notes\nThe timing of cash payments for income taxes, which is governed by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing jurisdictions, will differ from the timing of recording tax expense and deferred income taxes, which are reported in accordance with GAAP. For example, tax laws in effect regarding accelerated or bonus\u201d depreciation for tax reporting resulted in less cash payments than the GAAP tax expense. Acceleration of tax deductions could eventually result in situations where cash payments will exceed GAAP tax expense.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into surety, performance, and similar bonds as required by certain jurisdictions in which we provide services. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $3.8 million of these bonds outstanding.\nIncome taxes decreased $4.5 million in 2014 compared to 2013. Our effective rate was 45.8% for 2014 compared to 36.9% for 2013. In 2014, we released the full $1.5 million valuation allowance and related deferred tax asset of $0.5 million maintained against the Federal NOL carryforwards subject to separate return limitation year restrictions and placed a valuation allowance on the state tax credit carryforwards of $0.5 million and related deferred tax asset of $0.3 million. The acquisition of Enventis on October 16, 2014 resulted in changes to our unitary state filings and correspondingly our state deferred income taxes. These changes resulted in a net increase of $2.1 million to our net state deferred tax liabilities and a corresponding increase to our state tax. In addition, we incurred non-deductible transaction costs in relation to the acquisition that resulted in an increase to our tax provision of $0.7 million. During 2013, we recognized $1.2 million of our previously unrecognized tax benefits, which resulted in a decrease to our tax expense of $0.8 million, due to the expiration of a state statute of limitations. We also recognized approximately $0.7 million of tax expense during 2013 to adjust our 2012 provision to match our 2012 returns. Exclusive of these adjustments, our effective tax rate for 2014 would have been approximately 36.6% compared to 37.1% for 2013.\nOur revolving credit facility has a maturity date of December 23, 2018 and an applicable margin (at our election) of between 2.50% and 3.25% for LIBOR-based borrowings or between 1.50% and 2.25% for alternate base rate borrowings, depending on our leverage ratio. Based on our leverage ratio at December 31, 2015, the borrowing margin for the next three month period ending March 31, 2016 will be at a weighted-average margin of 3.00% for a LIBOR-based loan or 2.00% for an alternate base rate loan. The applicable borrowing margin for the revolving credit facility is adjusted quarterly to reflect the leverage ratio from the prior quarter-end. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, borrowings of $10.0 million and $39.0 million, respectively, were outstanding under the revolving credit facility. A stand-by letter of credit of $1.6 million, issued in connection with the Company's insurance coverage, was outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2015. The stand-by letter of credit is renewable annually and reduces the borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2015, $63.4 million was available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility.\nWe are an integrated communications services company that operates as both an Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier ( ILEC\u201d) and a Competitive Local Exchange Carrier ( CLEC\u201d) dependent upon the territory served. We provide an array of services in consumer, commercial and carrier channels in 11 states, including local and long-distance service, high-speed broadband Internet access, video services, Voice over Internet Protocol ( VoIP\u201d), custom calling features, private line services, carrier grade access services, network capacity services over our regional fiber optic networks, data center and managed services, directory publishing, equipment sales and cloud data services.\nIn addition, the PUCT is required to develop a needs test for post-2017 funding and has held workshops on various proposals. The PUCT issued its recommendation to the Texas state commissioners in May 2014, which was approved in December 2014. The needs test allows for a one-time disaggregation of line rates from a per line flat rate, then a competitive test must be met to receive funding. The deadline for submission of the needs test is December 31, 2016. We expect to complete the needs test as required and file for continued funding by the 2016 deadline.\nIn 2014, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Enventis for shares of our common stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares. The purchase price consisted of cash and the repayment of debt of $139.6 million, net of cash acquired, and the issuance of shares of the Company's common stock valued at $257.7 million. The funds required to repay Enventis' outstanding debt was financed in part with the sale of $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Senior Notes due 2022, as described below.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIncome taxes decreased $10.2 million in 2015 compared to 2014. Our effective rate was 131.9% for 2015 compared to 45.8% for 2014. In 2015, we placed additional valuation allowances on state NOL and state tax credit carryforwards of $3.9 million and $1.1 million, respectively, and related deferred tax asset of $0.2 million and $0.7 million, respectively. We also recorded a net increase of $1.9 million to our net state deferred tax liabilities and a corresponding increase to our state tax expense due to changes in state deferred income tax rates. In 2014, we released the full $1.5 million valuation allowance and related deferred tax asset of $0.5 million maintained against the Federal NOL carryforwards subject to separate return limitation year restrictions and placed a valuation allowance on the state tax credit carryforwards of $0.5 million and related deferred tax asset of $0.3 million. The acquisition of Enventis on October 16, 2014 resulted in changes to our unitary state filings and correspondingly our state deferred income taxes. These changes resulted in a net increase of $2.1 million to our net state deferred tax liabilities and a corresponding increase to our state tax. In addition, we incurred non-deductible transaction costs in relation to the acquisition that resulted in an increase to our tax provision of $0.7 million. Exclusive of these adjustments, our effective tax rate for 2015 would have been approximately 7.9% compared to 36.6% for 2014. The 2015 effective tax rate differed from the federal and state statutory rates primarily due to state tax credits and differences in allocable income for the Company's state tax filings.\nTexas\nSubsidies revenue increased $1.2 million during 2014 compared to 2013 primarily from the addition of Enventis revenue.\nSurety Bonds\nThe following table summarizes our indebtedness as of December 31, 2015:\nThe cost to maintain our Pension Plans and future funding requirements are affected by several factors including the expected return on investment of the assets held by the Pension Plan, changes in the discount rate used to calculate pension expense and the amortization of unrecognized gains and losses. Returns generated on Plan assets have historically funded a significant portion of the benefits paid under the Pension Plans. For 2015, the estimated long-term rate of return of Plan assets was 8.00%. As of January 1, 2016, we estimate that the long-term rate of return of Plan assets will be 7.75%. The Pension Plans invest in marketable equity securities which are exposed to changes in the financial markets. If the financial markets experience a downturn and returns fall below our estimate, we could be required to make a material contribution to the Pension Plan, which could adversely affect our cash flows from operations.\nbe lifted effective September 1, 2013 and (ii) rural and urban local rate benchmarks be developed. The large company fund review was completed in September 2012 and the PUCT addressed the small fund participants in Docket 41097 Rate Rebalancing ( Docket 41097\u201d), as discussed below.\nIn addition to the results reported in accordance with US GAAP, we also use certain non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to evaluate operating performance and to facilitate the comparison of our historical results and trends. These financial measures are not a measure of financial performance under US GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income as a measure of performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. They are not, on their own, necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as determined in accordance with GAAP. The calculation of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP are provided below.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\n (1) Other, net includes the equity earnings from our investments, dividend income, income attributable to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries, acquisition and transaction related costs including severance and certain other miscellaneous items. \nAmong other matters, the 2022 Notes indenture provides that CCI may not pay dividends or make other restricted payments, as defined in the indenture, if its total net leverage ratio is 4.75:1.00 or greater. This ratio is calculated differently than the comparable ratio under the Credit Agreement; among other differences, it takes into account, on a pro forma basis, synergies expected to be achieved as a result of certain acquisitions not yet reflected in historical results. At December 31, 2015, this ratio was 4.33:1.00. If this ratio is met, dividends and other restricted payments may be made from cumulative consolidated cash flow since April 1, 2012, less 1.75 times fixed charges, less dividends and other restricted payments made since May 30, 2012. Dividends may be paid and other restricted payments may also be made from a basket\u201d of $50.0 million, none of which has been used to date, and pursuant to other exceptions identified in the indenture. Since dividends of $253.1 million have been paid since May 30, 2012, including the quarterly dividend declared in November 2015 and paid on February 1, 2016, there was $351.5 million of the $604.6 million of cumulative consolidated cash flow since May 30, 2012 available to pay dividends as of December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with all terms, conditions and covenants under the indenture governing the 2022 Notes.\nof our cash flow to fund capital expenditures, meet scheduled payments of long-term debt, make dividend payments and to invest in future business opportunities.\nWe lease certain facilities and equipment under various capital leases which expire between 2015 and 2021. As of December 31, 2015, the present value of the minimum remaining lease commitments was approximately $7.6 million, of which $1.8 million was due and payable within the next twelve months. The leases require total remaining rental payments of $9.4 million as of December 31, 2015, of which $4.3 million will be paid to LATEL LLC, a related party entity.\nOther products and services include revenues from telephone directory publishing, video advertising and billing and support services. Other products and services revenue increased $3.5 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily from the addition of Enventis revenue of $3.9 million for its billing and support services and an increase in video advertising revenues, which was offset by a decline in directory publishing revenue.\nKey Operating Statistics\nOn September 13, 2013, we completed the sale of the assets and contractual rights used to provide communications services to thirteen county jails located in Illinois. The sale was completed for an aggregate purchase price of $2.5 million, resulting in a gain of $1.3 million, net of tax. The financial results of the operations for our prison services business have been reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nUnder our credit agreement, if our total net leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement), as of the end of any fiscal quarter, is greater than 5.10:1.00, we will be required to suspend dividends on our common stock unless otherwise permitted by an exception for dividends that may be paid from the portion of proceeds of any sale of equity not used to fund acquisitions, or make other investments. During any dividend suspension period, we will be required to repay debt in an amount equal to 50.0% of any increase in Available Cash, among other things. In addition, we will not be permitted to pay dividends if an event of default under the credit agreement has occurred and is continuing. Among other things, it will be an event of default if our total net leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter is greater than 5.25:1.00 and less than 2.25:1.00, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, our total net leverage ratio under the credit agreement was 4.23:1.00, and our interest coverage ratio was 4.12:1.00.\n\ngreater expenditures per customer to build and maintain. By supporting the high-cost of operations in rural markets, Universal Service Fund ( USF\u201d) subsidies promote widely available, quality telephone service at affordable prices in rural areas. Revenues from the federal and certain states' USFs increased $3.2 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the acquisition of Enventis in October 2014.\nOur significant accounting policies and estimates are discussed in the Notes to our consolidated financial statements. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management's application of our accounting policies. Our judgments are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, because future events and the related effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from our estimates and assumptions and such differences could be material. Management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.\nContractual Obligations\nSelling, general and administrative costs increased $37.6 million during 2015 compared to 2014. The acquisition of Enventis in 2014 contributed $29.7 million of the increase. In addition, as part of the Company's continued integration efforts, an early retirement program was initiated during 2015 to a group of select employees who were 55 years of age or older and who have provided 15 or more years of service. The employees were primarily in non-customer facing positions or positions in which the Company believed the retiree's workload could be absorbed internally as part of the Company's continuing cost saving initiatives. The early retirement package was accepted by approximately 60 employees and, as a result, one-time severance costs of $7.2 million were incurred in 2015. The Company expects approximately $4.8 million in future annual savings as a result of the early retirement program. The remaining increase in selling, general and administrative costs was primarily due to an increase in property taxes and regulatory fees and increased pension costs in the current year. These increases were offset in part by a decline in employee-related costs and a reduction in advertising expense in 2015.\nOperating Expenses\nIncome Taxes\nCapital Leases\nOutlook and Overview\nSubject to certain exceptions and qualifications, the indenture governing the 2022 Notes contains customary covenants that, among other things, limits CCI's and its restricted subsidiaries' ability to: incur additional debt or issue certain preferred stock; pay dividends or make other distributions on capital stock or prepay subordinated indebtedness; purchase or redeem any equity interests; make investments; create liens; sell assets; enter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments by restricted subsidiaries; consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its assets; engage in transactions with its affiliates; or enter into any sale and leaseback transactions. The indenture also contains customary events of default.\nWe offer several different basic local phone service packages and long-distance calling plans, including unlimited flat-rate calling plans. The plans include options for voicemail and other custom calling features such as caller ID, call forwarding and call waiting. Voice services revenue increased $0.4 million during 2015 compared to 2014 and decreased $3.7 million during 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding the addition of Enventis revenue of $5.5 million and $1.5 million, respectively, voice services revenue decreased $5.1 million and $5.2 million, respectively, primarily due to a 9% and 13% decline in voice connections, respectively. The number of local access lines in service directly affects the recurring revenue we generate from end users and continues to be impacted by the industry-wide decline in access lines. We expect to continue to experience modest erosion in voice connections due to competition from alternative technologies, including our own competing VoIP product.\nThrough our acquisition of Enventis in 2014, we obtained a leading market relationship with Cisco Systems, Inc. and, as a result, are an accredited Master Level Unified Communications and Gold Certified Cisco Partner providing equipment solutions and support for business customers. As an equipment integrator, we offer network design, implementation and support services, including maintenance contracts, in order to provide integrated communication solutions for our customers. When an equipment sale involves multiple deliverables, revenue is allocated to each respective element based on relative selling price. Equipment sales and services are non-recurring and changes in revenue can be attributed to the timing and volume of customer sales, which can vary each quarter and result in positive or negative fluctuations in our quarterly operating revenues and expenses. Equipment sales and service revenue increased $45.0 million during 2015 compared to 2014 and $10.0 million during 2014 compared to 2013 due to the acquisition of Enventis.\nFCC Matters\nBalance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet. The adoption of this guidance resulted in the reclassification of approximately $12.4 million of net deferred tax assets from current assets to noncurrent net deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2015. Prior period amounts were not retrospectively adjusted.\nTo the extent that our business plans or projections change or prove to be inaccurate, we may require additional financing or require financing sooner than we currently anticipate. Sources of additional financing may include commercial bank borrowings, other strategic debt financing, sales of nonstrategic assets, vendor financing or the private or public sales of equity and debt securities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future, that anticipated revenue growth will be realized, or that future borrowings or equity issuances will be available in amounts sufficient to provide adequate sources of cash to fund our expected uses of cash. Failure to obtain adequate financing, if necessary, could require us to significantly reduce our operations or level of capital expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the results of operations.\nEBITDA is defined as net earnings before interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is comprised of EBITDA, adjusted for certain items as permitted or required under our credit facility as described in the reconciliations below. These measures are a common measure of operating performance in the telecommunications industry and are useful, with other data, as a means to evaluate our ability to fund our estimated uses of cash.\nInterest Expense, Net\nOur interest rate swaps are measured using valuation models which rely on quoted market prices and observable market data of similar instruments. The valuation models require estimates of future interest rates and judgments about the future credit worthiness of the Company and each counterparty over the terms of the contracts.\nThe following tables are a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nThe credit agreement contains various provisions and covenants, including, among other items, restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, incur additional indebtedness, and issue capital stock. We have agreed to maintain certain financial ratios, including interest coverage and total net leverage ratios, all as defined in the credit agreement. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the credit agreement covenants.\nNon-Operating Items\nEnventis Merger\n \u00b7 1.0% terminal growth rate. \nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nInterest expense, net of interest income, decreased $2.9 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a reduction in the interest rate for our outstanding senior notes. In June 2015, we issued an additional $300.0 million in 6.50% Senior Notes due 2022, which were used, in part, to redeem our outstanding 10.875% Senior Notes due 2020, as described below. The New Notes were issued as an add-on to the $200.0 million in 6.50% Senior Notes issued in September 2014, the proceeds of which were used, in part, to fund the acquisition of Enventis in October 2014. Interest expense was also reduced in 2015 by declines in non-cash interest expense related to our de-designated interest rate swap agreements and additional financing costs in 2014 related to the bridge loan facility obtained for the Enventis acquisition.\nIn an ongoing proceeding relating to the New Regulatory Framework, the CPUC adopted Decision 06-08-030 in 2006, which grants carriers broader pricing freedom in the provision of telecommunications services, bundling of services, promotions and customer contracts. This decision adopted a new regulatory framework, the Uniform Regulatory Framework ( URF\u201d), which among other things (i) eliminates price regulation and allows full pricing flexibility for all new and retail services, (ii) allows new forms of bundles and promotional packages of telecommunication services, (iii) allocates all gains and losses from the sale of assets to shareholders and (iv) eliminates almost all elements of rate of return regulation, including the calculation of shareable earnings. In December 2010, the CPUC issued a ruling to initiate a new proceeding to assess whether, or to what extent, the level of competition in the telecommunications industry is sufficient to control prices for the four largest ILECs in the state. Subsequently, the CPUC issued a ruling temporarily deferring the proceeding. When the CPUC may open this proceeding is unclear and on hold at this time. The CPUC's actions in this and future proceedings could lead to new rules and an increase in government regulation. The Company will continue to monitor this matter.\nAs discussed in the Regulatory Matters\u201d section above, in December 2014, the FCC released a report and order that significantly impacts the amount of support revenue we receive from the USF, CAF and ICC by redirecting support from voice services to broadband services. Our annual funding under CAF Phase I of $36.6 million will be replaced by annual funding under CAF Phase II of $13.9 million through 2020. In the state of Iowa, where CAF Phase II funding is greater than the CAF Phase I funding, the CAF Phase II funding will be received with a retroactive payment back to January 1, 2015. For all other states, funding under CAF Phase II is less than funding under CAF Phase I. The acceptance of funding at the lower level will transition over a three year period, beginning in August 2015, at the rates of 75% of the CAF Phase I funding level in the first year, 50% in the second year and 25% in the third year. For the period from August 2015 through December 2015, the Company received and recognized approximately $6.4 million in total CAF Phase II funding, which includes the retroactive payment for Iowa of approximately $0.6 million.\n \u00b7 business and residential subscribers of basic exchange services; \nRelated Party Transactions\nIn accordance with the provisions of SB 583, as discussed in the Regulatory Matters\u201d section above, our annual $1.4 million Texas HCAF support was eliminated effective January 1, 2014. In addition, in accordance with the provisions of the settlement agreement reached with the PUCT, the HCF draw will be reduced by approximately $1.2 million annually over a four year period beginning June 1, 2014 through 2018. However, we have the ability to fully offset this reduction with increases to residential rates where market conditions allow, which the Company filed for and implemented in 2014 and 2015.\n (3) Unrecorded purchase obligations include binding commitments for future capital expenditures and service and maintenance agreements to support various computer hardware and software applications and certain equipment. If we terminate any of the contracts prior to their expiration date, we would be liable for minimum commitment payments as defined by the contractual terms of the contracts. \nCalifornia\nAn order adopted by the FCC in 2011 (the Order\u201d) will significantly impact the amount of support revenue we receive from the USF, Connect America Fund ( CAF\u201d) and ICC. The Order reformed core parts of the USF, broadly recast the existing ICC scheme, established the CAF to replace support revenues provided by the current USF and redirected support from voice services to broadband services. In 2012, CAF Phase I was implemented, which froze USF support to price cap carriers until the FCC implemented a broadband cost model to shift support from voice services to broadband services. The Order also modified the methodology used for ICC traffic exchanged between carriers. The initial phase of ICC reform was effective on July 1, 2012, beginning the transition of our terminating switched access rates to bill-and-keep over a seven year period, and as a result, our network access revenue decreased approximately $1.3 million during 2015.\n \u00b7 long distance carriers for network access service; \nOur net working capital position improved $4.0 million as of December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of an increase in cash and cash equivalents due in part to a decline in accounts receivable and additional cash distributions from our wireless partnerships in the current year. Income tax receivable also increased primarily due to the loss on the extinguishment of debt recognized in 2015. The improvement in working capital was also due to a decline in current liabilities as a result of a decrease in accrued compensation at December 31, 2015. The change in working capital was also impacted by the adoption as of December 31, 2015 of Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17 ( ASU 2015-17\u201d),\nCost of Services and Products\nEquipment Sales and Service\nalternative communications services and competition for these subscribers continues to increase. Excluding the increase in voice connections as a result of the acquisition of Enventis in 2014, total voice connections decreased 5% as of December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014. Competition from wireless providers, competitive local exchange carriers and, in some cases, cable television providers has increased in recent years in the markets we serve. We have been able to mitigate some of the access line losses through marketing initiatives and product offerings, such as our VoIP service. In addition, our video connection growth is decelerating. Excluding Enventis, total video connections decreased 6% as of December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014. The consumer's growing acceptance of OTT video services either to augment their current viewing options or to entirely replace their video subscription may impact our future video subscriber base, which could result in a decline in video revenue as well as a reduction in video programing costs. We believe this trend in changing consumer viewing habits will continue to impact our business model and strategy of providing consumers the necessary broadband speed to facilitate OTT content viewing.\n \u00b7 6.0% weighted average cost of capital based on comparable public companies and adjusting for risks unique to our business and the cash flow assumptions utilized in the analysis; and \nThe following tables reflect our financial results on a consolidated basis and key operating statistics as of and for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nBroadband Services\nNet cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $119.5 million during 2015, a decrease of $127.3 million from 2014 primarily due to cash used for the acquisition of Enventis in 2014.\n (1) Interest on long-term debt includes amounts due on fixed and variable rate debt. As the rates on our variable debt are subject to change, the rates in effect at December 31, 2015 were used in determining our future interest obligations. \nSubsidies\nWe use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage the risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and to convert a portion of future cash flows associated with the interest to be paid on our credit facility from a floating rate to a fixed rate. All derivative financial statements are recognized in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. For the derivative financial instruments designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of interest expense in the period in which the hedged item affects earnings. Any ineffectiveness is recognized immediately in earnings. For derivative financial instruments not designated as a cash flow hedge or have been determined to no longer be effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item and have been de-designated, then the changes in the market value of these instruments are recorded in the statement of operations as a component of interest expense.\nOn October 16, 2015, we completed an exchange offer to register all of the 2022 Notes under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d). The terms of the registered 2022 Notes are substantially identical to the 2022 Notes prior to the exchange, except that the notes are now registered under the Securities Act and the transfer restrictions and registration rights applicable to the original 2022 Notes no longer apply to the registered 2022 Notes. The exchange offer did not impact the aggregate principal amount or the remaining terms of the 2022 Notes outstanding.\nData and Transport Services\nDividends\nOther products and services revenue decreased $0.1 million during 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding the addition of Enventis revenue of $1.4 million, other products and services revenue decreased $1.5 million primarily due to a decline in directory publishing revenue.\nSenior Notes\nState Matters\nSignificant Recent Developments\nBroadband services revenue increased $12.8 million during 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the addition of Enventis revenue of $13.5 million, broadband services revenue decreased $0.7 million primarily due to an 8% decline in video connections and increased discounts on our data service offerings. We expect data revenue to grow as a result of the rising consumer demand for data-based services. However, the revenue growth was tempered by a decrease in VoIP revenue during that same period due to a decline in voice connections as more consumers have begun to rely exclusively on wireless service.\nInvestment income increased $2.2 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in earnings from our wireless partnership interests, which was reduced in part by an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $0.8 million during 2015 as a result of the sale of our equity interest in Central Valley Independent Network, LLC. Other, net decreased $0.6 million compared to 2014 primarily due to additional reserves related to disputed tax assessments recognized in 2015.\nBroadband services revenue increased $5.7 million during 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding the addition of Enventis revenue of $3.4 million, broadband services revenue increased $2.3 million primarily due to growth in Internet access revenue and video subscriptions revenue.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our contractual obligations were as follows:\nTradenames\nFunctional management within the organization evaluates the operations of our single reporting unit on a consolidated basis rather than at a geographic level or on any other component basis. In general, product managers and cost managers are responsible for managing costs and services across territories rather than treating the territories as separate business units. The operations of our Illinois, Texas, Pennsylvania, California, Kansas and Missouri properties share network operations monitoring call routing and research and development costs and share remittance, customer service and billing systems. In connection with our recent acquisition of Enventis in October 2014, the functional realignment occurred shortly after close. The continued integration of the various systems and processes in place at Enventis will occur over the next several quarters. All of the properties are managed at a functional level. In addition, the Pennsylvania territories receive their video programming from a video head-end located in the Illinois territory, and all of the networks provide redundancy. As a result, we evaluate the operations for all our service territories as a single reporting unit.\nIn 2014, we redeemed $72.8 million of the original aggregate principal amount of our 10.875% Senior Notes due 2020, as described in the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section below. In connection with the redemption of the 2020 Notes, we paid $84.1 million and recognized a loss of $13.8 million on the partial extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2014. In 2015, we redeemed the remaining $227.2 million of the 2020 Notes for $261.9 million and recognized a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $41.2 million during 2015.\n\nRevenues increased $140.0 million during 2015 compared to 2014, primarily from growth in commercial services, total data connections and the acquisition of Enventis Corporation ( Enventis\u201d) in October 2014, as described below. We generate the majority of our consolidated operating revenues primarily from subscriptions to our video, data and transport services (collectively broadband services\u201d) to business and residential customers. We expect our broadband services revenue to continue to grow as consumer and commercial demands for data based services increase.\nthree year period based on the CAF Phase I funding levels at the rates of 75% in the first year, 50% in the second year and 25% in the third year. For the period from August 2015 through December 2015, the Company received and recognized approximately $6.4 million in total CAF Phase II funding, which includes the retroactive payment for Iowa of approximately $0.6 million.\nDerivatives\nThe Term 4 loan was issued in an original aggregate principal amount of $910.0 million with a maturity date of December 23, 2020. The Term 4 loan contains an original issuance discount of $4.6 million, which is being amortized over the term of the loan. The Term 4 loan requires quarterly principal payments of $2.3 million, which commenced March 31, 2014, and has an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.25% subject to a 1.00% LIBOR floor.\nFor information regarding the impact of certain recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 Business Description & Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated Financial Statements included in this report in Part II -Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d.\nOur Texas ILECs have historically received support from two state funds, the small and rural incumbent local exchange company plan High Cost Fund ( HCF\u201d) and the High Cost Assistance Fund ( HCAF\u201d). The HCF is a line-based fund used to keep local rates low. The rate is applied on all residential lines and up to five single business lines. The amount we receive from the HCAF is a frozen monthly amount that was originally developed to offset high intrastate toll rates.\nNetwork access services include interstate and intrastate switched access revenue, network special access services and end user access. Switched access revenue includes access services to other communications carriers to terminate or originate long-distance calls on our network. Special access circuits provide dedicated lines and trunks to business customers and interexchange carriers. Network access services revenue decreased $1.8 million during 2015 compared to 2014 and $5.7\nOur most significant use of funds in 2016 is expected to be for: (i) dividend payments of between $78.0 million and $80.0 million; (ii) interest payments on our indebtedness of between $73.0 million and $75.0 million and principal payments on debt of $9.1 million; and (iii) capital expenditures of between $125.0 million and $130.0 million. In the future, our ability to use cash may be limited by our other expected uses of cash, including our dividend policy, and our ability to incur additional debt will be limited by our existing and future debt agreements.\nEnventis is an advanced communications provider, which services consumer, commercial and wholesale carrier customer channels primarily in the upper Midwest. The acquisition reflects our strategy to diversify revenue and cash flows amongst multiple products and to expand our network to new markets. The financial results for Enventis have been included in our consolidated financial statements as of the acquisition date.\nAs discussed more fully in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, goodwill is not amortized but instead evaluated for impairment annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate potential impairment, for impairment using a preliminary qualitative assessment and two-step quantitative process, if deemed necessary. The evaluation of goodwill may first include a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Events and circumstances integrated into the qualitative assessment process include a combination of macroeconomic conditions affecting equity and credit markets, significant changes to the cost structure, overall financial performance and other relevant events affecting the reporting unit. A company is permitted to skip the qualitative assessment at its election, and proceed to step one of the quantitative test, which we chose to do in 2015.\nOther Income\nOperating Revenues\nData and transport services revenue increased $65.8 million during 2015 compared to 2014 and $23.0 million during 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding the addition of Enventis revenue of $57.5 million and $14.1 million, respectively, data and transport services revenue increased $8.3 million and $8.9 million, respectively, primarily from growth in data connections and a continued increase in VoIP, Internet access and Metro Ethernet revenue. Fiber transport and cellular backhaul revenue also increased as network bandwidth demand for wireless data continues to escalate.\nA one percentage-point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have the following effects on net periodic benefit cost:\nIn December 2013, the Company, through certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries, entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with various financial institutions (the Credit Agreement\u201d) to replace the Company's previously amended credit agreement. The Credit Agreement consists of a $75.0 million revolving credit facility and initial term loans in the aggregate amount of $910.0 million ( Term 4\u201d). The Credit Agreement also includes an incremental term loan facility which provides the ability to request to borrow up to $300.0 million of incremental term loans subject to certain terms and conditions. Borrowings under the senior secured credit facility are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, with the exception of Consolidated Communications of Illinois Company (formerly known as Illinois Consolidated Telephone Company) and our majority-owned subsidiary, East Texas Fiber Line Incorporated.\nOur exceptional consumer broadband speed allows us to continue to meet the needs of our customers and the demand for higher speed resulting from the growing trend of over-the-top ( OTT\u201d) content viewing. The availability of 1 Gbps data speed also complements our wireless home networking ( Wi-Fi\u201d) that supports our TV Everywhere service and allows our subscribers to watch their favorite programs at home or away on a computer, smartphone or tablet.\nThe carrying value of our tradenames, excluding any finite lived tradenames, was $10.6 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we completed our annual impairment test using a DCF methodology based on a relief from royalty method and determined that there was no impairment of our tradename.\nIn June 2013, the Texas state legislature passed Senate Bill No. 583 ( SB 583\u201d). The provisions of SB 583 were effective September 1, 2013 and froze HCF and HCAF support for the remainder of 2013. As of January 1, 2014, our annual $1.4 million HCAF support was eliminated and the frozen HCF support returned to funding on a per line basis. In July 2013, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the PUCT on Docket 41097, which was approved by the PUCT in August 2013. In accordance with the provisions of the settlement agreement, the HCF draw will be reduced by approximately $1.2 million annually over a four year period beginning June 1, 2014 through 2018. However, we have the ability to fully offset this reduction with increases to residential rates where market conditions allow, which the Company filed for in April 2014 and implemented in June 2014.\n (1) A non-GAAP measure. See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for additional information and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. \n \u00b7 cash flow assumptions regarding investment in network facilities, distribution channels and customer base (the assumptions underlying these inputs are based upon a combination of historical results and trends, new industry developments and the Company's business plans); \nWe believe that cash flows from operating activities, together with our existing cash and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient for at least the next twelve months to fund our current anticipated uses of cash. After that, our ability to fund these expected uses of cash and to comply with the financial covenants under our debt agreements will depend on the results of future operations, performance and cash flow. Our ability to fund these expected uses from the results of future operations will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, regulatory, legislative and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\n\nNet proceeds from asset sales exceeding certain thresholds, to the extent not reinvested, are required to be used to repay loans outstanding under the credit agreement.\nOverview\nNet pension and post-retirement (benefit)/costs were $(2.2) million, $(5.5) million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We contributed $12.2 million, $11.1 million and $11.5 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively to our pension plans. For our other post-retirement plans, we contributed $3.0 million, $2.7 million and $2.8 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In 2016, we expect to make contributions totaling approximately $0.3 million to our non-qualified supplemental retirement plans and $3.6 million to our other post-retirement benefit plans. We do not expect to contribute to our qualified defined pension plans in 2016. Our contribution amounts meet the minimum funding requirements as set forth in employee benefit and tax laws. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion regarding our pension and other post-retirement plans.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n6.50% Senior Notes due 2022\nAt the federal level, the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC\u201d) generally exercises jurisdiction over facilities and services of local exchange carriers, such as our rural telephone companies, to the extent they are used to provide, originate or terminate interstate or international communications. The FCC has the authority to condition, modify, cancel, terminate or revoke our operating authority for failure to comply with applicable federal laws or FCC rules, regulations and policies. Fines or penalties also may be imposed for any of these violations.\nDiscontinued Operations\nPennsylvania\nOur current and deferred income taxes and associated valuation allowances are impacted by events and transactions arising in the normal course of business as well as in connection with the adoption of new accounting standards, acquisitions of businesses and non-recurring items. Assessment of the appropriate amount and classification of income taxes is dependent on several factors, including estimates of the timing and realization of deferred income tax assets and the timing of income tax payments. Actual amounts may materially differ from these estimates as a result of changes in tax laws as well as unanticipated future transactions impacting related income tax balances. We account for tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in accordance with the accounting guidance applicable for uncertainty in income taxes, which requires the use of a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.\nAt November 30, 2015, the fair value of the single reporting unit's total equity was estimated at approximately $1.3 billion on a control basis, and the associated carrying value of its equity was $269.8 million. For all valuation methods used, the fair value of equity exceeds its carrying value. The use of different estimates or assumptions in the DCF model could result in a different fair value conclusion. As a sensitivity calculation, if the discount rate in our DCF model was increased 1.0 percentage point from 6.0% to 7.0%, the fair value would decrease from approximately $1.3 billion to approximately $1.2 billion, which would not result in an impairment of goodwill, assuming there are no changes to the market-based approaches used in the valuation. Assuming the discount rate in our DCF model was increased 2.0 percentage points, the terminal growth rate decreased by 0.05 percentage point, and each of the market-based valuation approaches decreased in\nRegulatory Matters\nWe may be unable to access the cash flows of our subsidiaries since certain of our subsidiaries are parties to credit or other borrowing agreements, or subject to statutory or regulatory restrictions, that restrict the payment of dividends or making intercompany loans and investments, and those subsidiaries are likely to continue to be subject to such restrictions and prohibitions for the foreseeable future. In addition, future agreements that our subsidiaries may enter into governing the terms of indebtedness may restrict our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends or advance cash in any other manner to us.\nRegulatory Matters\nIn determining the appropriate discount rate, we consider the current yields on high-quality corporate fixed-income investments with maturities that correspond to the expected duration of our pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations. For our 2015 and 2014 projected benefit obligations, we used a discount rate of 4.76% and 4.27%, respectively, for our pension plans and 4.61% and 4.11%, respectively, for our other postretirement plans.\nWe recognize certain revenues pursuant to various cost recovery programs from federal and state USF. Revenues are calculated based on our estimates and assumptions regarding various financial data, including operating expenses, taxes and investment in property, plant and equipment. Non-financial data estimates are also utilized, including projected demand usage and detailed network information. We must also make estimates of the jurisdictional separation of this data to assign current financial and operating data to the interstate or intrastate jurisdiction. These estimates are finalized in future periods as actual data becomes available to complete the separation studies. We have historically collected revenues recognized through these programs; however, adjustments to estimated revenues in future periods are possible. These adjustments could be necessitated by adverse regulatory developments with respect to these subsidies and revenue sharing arrangements, changes in allowable rates of return and the determination of recoverable costs, or decreases in the availability of funds in the programs due to increased participation by other carriers.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nOn October 16, 2014, we completed our merger with Enventis and acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of Enventis in exchange for shares of our common stock. As a result, Enventis became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The total value of the purchase consideration exchanged was $257.7 million, excluding $149.9 million paid to extinguish Enventis' outstanding debt. On the date of the merger, we issued an aggregate total of 10.1 million shares of our common stock to the former Enventis shareholders.\nWe are also subject to a number of regulatory proceedings occurring at the federal and state levels that may have a material impact on our operations. The FCC and state commissions have authority to issue rules and regulations related to our business. A number of proceedings are pending or anticipated that are related to such telecommunications issues as competition, interconnection, access charges, intercarrier compensation, broadband deployment, consumer protection and universal service reform. Some proceedings may authorize new services to compete with our existing services. Proceedings that relate to our cable television operations include rulemakings on set top boxes, carriage of programming, industry consolidation and ways to promote additional competition. There are various on-going legal challenges to the scope or validity of FCC orders that have been issued. As a result, it is not yet possible to fully determine the impact of the related FCC rules and regulations on our operations.\nOur pension investment strategy is to maximize long-term returns on invested plan assets while minimizing the risk of volatility. Accordingly, we target our allocation percentage at approximately 60% in equity funds, with the remainder in fixed income and cash equivalents. Our assumed rate considers this investment mix as well as past trends. We used an expected long-term rate of return of 8.00% in 2015 and 2014. As of January 1, 2016, we estimate that the long-term rate of return of pension plan assets will be 7.75%.\nOur operating requirements have historically been funded from cash flows generated from our business and borrowings under our credit facilities. We expect that our future operating requirements will continue to be funded from cash flows from operating activities, existing cash and cash equivalents, and, if needed, from borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our ability to obtain future external financing. We anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion\nThe increase in our operating revenues during 2015 was offset, in part, by an anticipated industry-wide trend of a decline in consumer voice services, access lines and related network access. Many consumers are choosing to subscribe to\nVoice Services\nIn 2013, we amended our Credit Agreement to restate and amend our term loan credit facilities. In connection with entering into the amended and restated credit agreement, we incurred a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $7.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nmillion during 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding the addition of Enventis revenue of $6.0 million and $1.7 million, respectively, network access services revenue decreased $7.8 million and $7.4 million, respectively, primarily due to declines in switched and special access revenues. Special access revenue decreased primarily due to a reduction in the number of our carrier circuits; however, a portion of the decrease can be attributed to carriers shifting to our fiber Metro Ethernet product, contributing to the growth in that area. Switched access revenue decreased primarily as a result of the continuing decline in minutes of use and voice connections.\nSenior Notes Covenant Compliance\nWe market services to our residential customers either individually or as a bundled package. Our triple play\u201d bundle includes our voice, video and data services. Data connections continue to increase as a result of consumer trends toward increased Internet usage and our enhanced product and service offerings, such as our progressively increasing consumer data speeds. We introduced data speeds of up to 1 Gbps to approximately 20,000 of our fiber-to-the-home customers in our Kansas market and a limited portion of our Pennsylvania market in December 2014 and in our Texas market in the first quarter of 2015, with our California market to follow in 2016. Where 1 Gbps speeds are not yet offered, the maximum broadband speed is 100 Mbps, depending on the geographic market availability. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 29% of the homes in the areas we serve subscribe to our data service.\nOther Products and Services\n \u00b7 support payments from federal or state programs. \nIn general, our credit agreement restricts our ability to pay dividends to the amount of our Available Cash as defined in our credit agreement. As of December 31, 2015 and including the $19.6 million dividend declared in November 2015 and paid on February 1, 2016, we had $245.9 million in dividend availability under the credit facility covenant.\nOther Regulatory Matters\nDecember 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, gains of $0.8 million, $1.6 million and $2.2 million, respectively, were recognized as a reduction to interest expense for the change in fair value of the de-designated swaps.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nCapital Expenditures\nThe 2022 Notes mature on October 1, 2022 and interest is payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year. Consolidated Communications, Inc. ( CCI\u201d) is the primary obligor under the 2022 Notes, and we and certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the 2022 Notes. The 2022 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company.\nAcquisition and Other Transaction Costs\n (1) At December 31, 2015, the 1-month London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) applicable to our borrowings was 0.42%. The Term 4 loan is subject to a 1.00% LIBOR floor. \nThe comparability of our consolidated results of operations and key operating statistics was impacted by the Enventis acquisition that closed on October 16, 2014, as described above. Enventis' results are included in our consolidated financial statements as of the date of the acquisition. The acquisition provides additional diversification of the Company's revenues and cash flows both geographically and by service type.\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $219.2 million in 2015, an increase of $31.4 million as compared to 2014. Cash provided by operating activities increased primarily as a result of the additional cash flows provided by the addition of the Enventis operations as well as an increase in cash distributions from our wireless partnerships in 2015. These increases were offset in part by changes in working capital primarily due to the timing in receipts for accounts receivable, a decline in advance billings related to equipment sales and a decline in accounts payable related to the timing in payments to suppliers.\nWe provide a variety of business communication services to small, medium and large business customers, including many services over our advanced fiber network. The services we offer include scalable high speed broadband Internet access and VoIP phone services which range from basic service plans to virtual hosted systems. In addition to Internet and VoIP services, we also offer private line data services to businesses that include dedicated Internet access through our Metro Ethernet network. Wide Area Network ( WAN\u201d) products include point-to-point and multi-point deployments from 2.5 Mbps to 10 Gbps to accommodate the growth patterns of our business customers. Data center and disaster recovery solutions provide a reliable and local colocation option for commercial customers. We also offer wholesale services to regional and national interexchange and wireless carriers, including cellular backhaul and other fiber transport solutions.\nIn March 2015, the FCC released its net neutrality order which applies to all wireline and wireless providers of broadband internet access services. The net neutrality order addresses several areas that will be regulated and others that are subject to forbearance. The regulations disallow blocking, throttling and paid prioritization by internet service providers. The net neutrality order also requires providers to disclose certain information to consumers on rates, fees, data allowances and packet loss. Finally, it gives the FCC codified enforcement authority and it forbears on certain Title II regulations. We are evaluating the net neutrality order, and we currently do not believe the order will result in any significant changes to the services we provide our customers, nor do we believe it will have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nThe Order also modifies the methodology used for ICC traffic exchanged between carriers. As a result of implementing the provisions of the Order, our network access revenue decreased approximately $1.3 million during 2015. We anticipate that network access revenue will continue to decline as a result of the Order through 2018 by as much as $1.9 million, $4.8 million and $6.8 million in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.\nResults of Operations\nIn December 2014, the FCC released a report and order that addressed, among other things, the transition to CAF Phase II funding for price cap carriers and the acceptance criteria for CAF Phase II funding. For companies that accept the CAF Phase II funding, there is a three year transition period in instances in which their current CAF Phase I funding exceeds the CAF Phase II funding. If CAF Phase II funding exceeds CAF Phase I funding, the transitional support is waived and CAF Phase II funding begins immediately. Companies are required to commit to a statewide build out requirement to 10 Mbps downstream and 1 Mbps upstream in funded locations. We accepted the CAF Phase II funding in August 2015. The annual funding under CAF Phase I of $36.6 million will be replaced by annual funding under CAF Phase II of $13.9 million through 2020. In the state of Iowa, where CAF Phase II funding is greater than the CAF Phase I funding, the CAF Phase II funding will be received with a retroactive payment back to January 1, 2015. For all other states, funding under CAF Phase II is less than funding under CAF Phase I. The acceptance of funding at the lower level will transition over a\nNon-GAAP Measures\nas an alternative to the traditional telephone line. Depending on geographic market availability, our video services range from limited basic service to advanced digital television, which includes several plans each with hundreds of local, national and music channels including premium and pay-per-view channels as well as video on-demand service. Certain customers may also subscribe to our advanced video services, which consist of high-definition television, digital video recorders ( DVR\u201d) and/or a whole home DVR.\n\nOn June 8, 2015, we issued an additional $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (the New Notes\u201d and together with the Existing Notes, the 2022 Notes\u201d). The New Notes were priced at 98.26% of par and resulted in total gross proceeds of approximately $294.8 million, excluding accrued interest. The net proceeds from the issuance of the New Notes were used, in part, to redeem the remaining $227.2 million of the original aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes, to pay related fees and expenses and to reduce the outstanding balance of our revolving credit facility. In connection with the redemption of the 2020 Notes, we paid $261.9 million and recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $41.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAs discussed in the Regulatory Matters\u201d section below, our operating revenues are also impacted by legislative or regulatory changes at the federal and state levels, which could reduce or eliminate the current subsidies revenue we receive. A number of proceedings and recent orders relate to universal service reform, intercarrier compensation and network access charges. There are various ongoing legal challenges to the orders that have been issued. As a result, it is not yet possible to determine fully the impact of the regulatory changes on our operations.\nFinancial Data\nItem 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe cash required to fund dividend payments is in addition to our other expected cash needs, which we expect to fund with cash flows from our operations. In addition, we expect we will have sufficient availability under our revolving credit facility to fund dividend payments in addition to any expected fluctuations in working capital and other cash needs, although we do not intend to borrow under this facility to pay dividends.\nCredit Agreement Covenant Compliance\nAcquisition and other transaction costs decreased $10.4 million during 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of the acquisition of Enventis, which closed in the fourth quarter of 2014. In 2014, we incurred $11.8 million in transaction related fees in connection with the acquisition of Enventis. Transaction costs consist primarily of legal, finance and other professional fees as well as expenses related to change-in-control payments to former employees of the acquired companies.\nIn September 2011, the Texas state legislature passed Senate Bill No. 980/House Bill No. 2603 which, among other things, mandated the PUCT to review the Universal Service Fund and issue recommendations by January 1, 2013 with the intent to effectively reduce the size of the Universal Service Fund. This would be accomplished by implementing an urban floor to offset state funding reductions with a phase-in period of four years. The PUCT recommended that (i) frozen line counts\n\nLong-term Debt\nAcquisition of Enventis\n (4) Recorded obligations include amounts in accounts payable and accrued expenses for external goods and services received as of December 31, 2015 and expected to be settled in cash. \nVoice services revenue increased $10.4 million during 2015 compared to 2014 and $2.8 million during 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding the addition of Enventis revenue of $14.4 million and $3.8 million, respectively, voice services revenue decreased $4.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively, primarily due to a 5% decline in access lines during each period as commercial customers are increasingly choosing alternative technologies, including our own VoIP product, and the broad range of features that Internet based voice services can offer.\nThe estimated fair value of our single reporting unit is determined using a combination of market-based approaches and a discounted cash flow ( DCF\u201d) model. The assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are based upon a combination of historical results and trends, new industry developments, future cash flow projections, as well as relevant comparable company earnings multiples for the market-based approaches. Such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. The market-based approaches used in the valuation effort includes the publicly-traded market capitalization, guideline public companies, and guideline transaction methods. We use a weighting of the results derived from the valuation approaches to estimate the fair value of the single reporting unit. Key assumptions used in the DCF model include the following:\nThe Texas Public Utilities Regulatory Act ( PURA\u201d) directs the Public Utilities Commission of Texas ( PUCT\u201d) to adopt and enforce rules requiring local exchange carriers to contribute to a state universal service fund that helps telecommunications providers offer basic local telecommunications service at reasonable rates in high-cost rural areas. The Texas Universal Service Fund is also used to reimburse telecommunications providers for revenues lost by providing lifeline service. Our Texas rural telephone companies receive disbursements from this fund.\n \u00b7 surcharges mandated by state commissions; \nThe amounts recognized in our financial statements for pension and postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing several critical assumptions. We make significant assumptions in regards to our pension and postretirement plans, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate used to value the periodic pension expense and liabilities, future salary increases and actuarial assumptions relating to mortality rates and healthcare trend rates. Changes in these estimates and other factors could significantly impact our benefit cost and obligations to maintain pension and postretirement plans.\nConsumer\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $30.5 million during 2015 compared to 2014, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Enventis during 2014 which accounted for $31.4 million of the increase. Excluding the addition of the operations for Enventis, depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.9 million in 2015 due to certain circuit, network and terminal equipment becoming fully depreciated during 2015, which was offset in part by capital expenditures for internally developed software and outside plant related to integration and success based projects.\nState regulatory commissions generally exercise jurisdiction over carriers' facilities and services to the extent they are used to provide, originate or terminate intrastate communications. In particular, state regulatory agencies have substantial oversight over interconnection and network access by competitors of our rural telephone companies. In addition, municipalities and other local government agencies regulate the public rights-of-way necessary to install and operate networks. State regulators can sanction our rural telephone companies or revoke our certifications if we violate relevant laws or regulations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n (3) Represents compensation expenses in connection with issuance of stock awards, which because of the non-cash nature of these expenses are excluded from adjusted EBITDA. \nGoodwill\nthe lease after the expiration date. Our Board of Directors member, Richard A. Lumpkin, and his immediate family had a beneficial ownership interest of 66.7% and 72.4% in 2015 and 2014, respectively, of LATEL, directly or through Agracel, Inc. ( Agracel\u201d). Agracel is real estate investment company of which Mr. Lumpkin, together with his family, had a beneficial interest of 33.5% and 44.7% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Agracel is the sole managing member and 50% owner of LATEL. In addition, Mr. Lumpkin is a director of Agracel. The three leases require total rental payments to LATEL of approximately $7.9 million over the term of the leases. The carrying value of the capital leases at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $3.0 million and $3.4 million, respectively. We recognized $0.4 million in interest expense in 2015 and $0.5 million in interest expense in each of 2014 and 2013 and amortization expense of $0.4 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013 related to the capitalized leases.\nIn 2011, the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission ( PAPUC\u201d) issued an intrastate access reform order reducing intrastate access rates to interstate levels in a three-step process, which began in March 2012. With the release of the FCC order in November 2011, the PAPUC temporarily issued a stay. A final stay was issued in 2012 to implement the FCC ordered intrastate access rate changes. The PAPUC had indicated that it would address state universal funding in 2013, but delayed conducting a proceeding pending any state legislative activity that may occur in the 2015 legislative session. The Company will continue to monitor this matter.\nOur revenues are subject to broad federal and/or state regulation, which include such telecommunications services as local telephone service, network access service and toll service and are derived from various sources, including:\nCapital expenditures continue to be our primary recurring investing activity and were $133.9 million in 2015, an increase of $24.9 million compared to 2014. Capital expenditures for 2016 are expected to be $125.0 million to $130.0 million, of which approximately 63% is planned for success-based capital projects for consumer, commercial and carrier initiatives. Capital expenditures in 2016 and subsequent years will depend on various factors, including competition, changes in technology, regulatory changes and the timing in the deployment of new services. We expect to continue to invest in existing and new services and the expansion of our fiber network in order to retain and acquire more customers through a broader set of products and an expanded network footprint.\nSubsidies consist of both federal and state subsidies, which are designed to promote widely available, quality telephone service at affordable prices in rural areas. Subsidies revenue increased $3.1 million during 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the addition of Enventis revenue of $6.8 million, subsidies revenue decreased $3.7 million as a result of a reduction in state funding support for our Texas ILEC and the transition from CAF Phase I to CAF Phase II funding. See the Regulatory Matters\u201d section below for further discussion of the subsidies we receive.\nVoice Services\nDuring 2014, interest expense, net of interest income, decreased $3.3 million compared to 2013 primarily due to a reduction in interest expense related to our interest rate swap agreements as a result of the maturity of several agreements during 2013. Interest rates on outstanding borrowings under our Credit Agreement also declined due to the amendment of our Credit Agreement in December 2013. These reductions in interest expense were partially offset by an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of a $200.0 million Senior Note offering in September 2014 used in part to fund the acquisition of Enventis. 2014 also included additional amortization of deferred financing fees of $1.4 million related to the bridge loan facility obtained for the Enventis acquisition.\nThe following table sets forth selected information regarding our financial condition.\nGoodwill and tradenames are intangible assets that are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We evaluate the carrying value of our indefinite-lived assets, tradenames and goodwill, as of November 30 of each year.\nIn 2013, interest rate swaps previously designated as cash flow hedges were de-designated as a result of amendments to our credit agreement. These interest rate swap agreements mature on various dates through September 2016. Prior to de-designation, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ( AOCI\u201d). The balance of the unrealized loss included in AOCI as of the date the swaps were de-designated is being amortized to earnings over the remaining term of the swap agreements. Changes in fair value of the de-designated swaps are immediately recognized in earnings as interest expense. During the years ended\nSufficiency of Cash Resources\nIn 2014, cost of services and products increased $20.2 million compared to 2013. The addition of the operations for Enventis during 2014 accounted for $18.8 million of the increase. Video programming costs also increased due to a growth in video connections and an increase in costs per program channel. However, the increase in video programming costs was largely offset by a decline in employee costs due to a reduction in headcount as a result of integration and cost reduction efforts in 2013 as well as a reduction in pension expense in 2014.\nIn 2014, depreciation and amortization expense increased $10.1 million compared to 2013, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Enventis during 2014 which accounted for $8.0 million of the increase. The remaining increase was primarily associated with ongoing capital expenditures related to network enhancements and success based capital projects for consumer and commercial services.\nMr. Lumpkin also has a minority ownership interest in First Mid-Illinois Bancshares, Inc. ( First Mid-Illinois\u201d). We provide telecommunications products and services to First Mid-Illinois at standard prices as to other strategic business customers and we received approximately $0.8 million in 2015 and $0.5 million in each of 2014 and 2013 for these services.\nWe believe that our dividend policy will limit, but not preclude, our ability to grow. If we continue paying dividends at the level currently anticipated under our dividend policy, we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash, and may need to seek refinancing, to fund a material expansion of our business, including any significant acquisitions or to pursue growth opportunities requiring capital expenditures significantly beyond our current expectations. In addition, because we expect a significant portion of cash available will be distributed to holders of common stock under our dividend policy, our ability to pursue any material expansion of our business will depend more than it otherwise would on our ability to obtain third-party financing.\nIncome taxes\n (2) Includes all cash dividends and other cash distributions received from our investments. \nThe telecommunications industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation. Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, federal and state regulators share responsibility for implementing and enforcing statutes and regulations designed to encourage competition and to preserve and advance widely available, quality telephone service at affordable prices.\nAs discussed more fully in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, tradenames are generally not amortized but instead evaluated annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate potential impairment, for impairment using a preliminary qualitative assessment and two-step process, if deemed necessary. We estimate the fair value of our tradenames using DCFs based on a relief from royalty method. If the fair value of our tradenames was less than the carrying amount, we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the tradename. In accordance with Accounting Codification Standard 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other ( ASC 350\u201d) separately recorded indefinite-lived intangible assets, whether acquired or internally developed, shall be combined into a single unit of accounting for purposes of testing impairment if they are operated as a single asset and, as such, are essentially inseparable from one another. An indefinite-lived intangible asset may need to be removed from the accounting unit if it is disposed of, the accounting unit is reconsidered or one or more of the separate indefinite-lived intangible asset(s) within the accounting unit is now considered finite-lived rather than indefinite-lived. We perform our impairment testing of our tradenames as single units of accounting based on their use in our business.\nIn December 2010, we entered into new lease agreements with LATEL LLC ( LATEL\u201d) for the occupancy of three buildings on a triple net lease basis. Each of the three lease agreements have a maturity date of May 31, 2021, and have been accounted for as capital leases. Each of the three lease agreements have two five-year options to extend the terms of\nSelling, General and Administrative Costs\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows:\nCommercial and Carrier\nWe continue to focus on commercial and broadband growth opportunities and are continually expanding our commercial product offerings for both small and large businesses to capitalize on industry technological advances. We can leverage our fiber optic networks and tailor our services for business customers by developing solutions to fit their specific needs. We gained strategic advantage through the acquisition of Enventis in 2014, which recently launched a suite of cloud data services that increases efficiency and reduces IT costs for our customers. In addition, we recently launched an enhanced hosted voice product, which enables greater scalability and reliability for businesses. We anticipate future momentum in new commercial services as these new products gain traction.\nA portion of the 2020 Notes were sold to accredited investors consisting of certain members of the Company's Board of Directors or a trust of which a director is the beneficiary ( related parties\u201d). In May 2012, the related parties purchased $10.8 million of the 2020 Notes on the same terms available to other investors, except that the related parties were not entitled to registration rights. In 2015, the 2020 Notes were fully redeemed and we paid an early redemption premium of $1.5 million and recognized interest expense of approximately $0.7 million, $1.3 million and $1.2 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, in the aggregate for the 2020 Notes purchased by related parties. In September 2014, $5.0 million of the 2022 Notes were sold to a trust, the beneficiary of which is a member of the Company's Board of Directors and in 2015 we recognized approximately $0.3 million in interest expense for the 2022 Notes purchased by the related party.\nThe weighted-average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under our credit facility was 4.24% and 4.20% at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Interest is payable at least quarterly.\nCredit Agreement\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nAt our November 30, 2015 assessment date, the carrying value of goodwill was $764.6 million.\nOur recently acquired Enventis ILEC properties are cost-based rate of return companies. Historically, under FCC rules governing rate making, these ILECs were required to establish rates for their interstate telecommunications services based on projected demand usage for the various services. We projected our earnings through the use of annual cost separation studies, which utilized estimated total cost information and projected demand usage. Carriers were required to follow FCC rules in the preparation of these annual studies. We determined actual earnings from our interstate rates as actual volumes and costs became known. Effective January 1, 2015, our Enventis ILECs are treated as price cap companies for universal service purposes. In March 2015, we filed a petition for waiver to keep them as rate of return companies for switched and special access. The petition was granted in October 2015. We expect certain adjustments to take place over 24 months as a result of exiting the National Exchange Carrier Association ( NECA\u201d) pool; however, we do not anticipate that they will be material to our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.\nAs required, we contribute to qualified defined pension plans and non-qualified supplemental retirement plans (collectively the Pension Plans\u201d) and other post-retirement benefit plans, which provide retirement benefits to certain eligible employees. Contributions are intended to provide for benefits attributed to service to date. Our funding policy is to contribute annually an actuarially determined amount consistent with applicable federal income tax regulations.", "item_7_text": "Cash Flows Provided by (Used In) Financing Activities\nIn order for an eligible telecommunications carrier ( ETC\u201d) to receive high-cost support, the USF/Intercarrier Compensation ( ICC\u201d) Transformation Order requires states to certify annually that USF support is used only for the provision, maintenance and upgrading of facilities and services for which the support is intended. States, in turn, require that ETCs file certifications with them as the basis for the state filings with the FCC. Failure to meet the annual data and certification deadlines can result in reduced support to the ETC based on the length of the delay in certification. For calendar year 2013, the California state certification was due to be filed with the FCC on or before October 1, 2012. We were notified in January 2013 that SureWest Communications ( SureWest\u201d) did not submit the required certification to the California Public Utilities Commission ( CPUC\u201d) in time to be included in its October 1, 2012 submission to the FCC. In January 2013, we filed a certification with the CPUC and filed a petition with the FCC for a waiver of the filing deadline for the annual state certification. In February 2013, the CPUC filed a certification with the FCC with respect to SureWest. In October 2013, the Wireline Competition Bureau of the FCC denied our petition for a waiver of the annual certification deadline. In November 2013, we applied for a review of the decision made by the FCC staff by the full Commission. Management is optimistic that the Company may prevail in its application to the Commission and receive USF funding for the period January 1, 2013 through June 30, 2013 based on the change in SureWest's USF filing status caused by the change in the ownership of SureWest, the lack of formal notice by the FCC regarding this change in filing status, the fact that SureWest had a previously filed certification of compliance in effect with the FCC for the two quarters for which USF was withheld and the FCC's past practice of granting waivers to accept late filings in similar situations. However, due to the denial of our petition by the Wireline Competition Bureau and the uncertainty of the collectability of previously recognized revenues, in December 2013 we reversed $3.0 million of previously recognized revenues until such time that the Commission has the opportunity to reach a decision on our application for review.\n (2) Weighted-average rate. \nBroadband services include revenue from residential customers for subscriptions to our VoIP, data and video products. We offer high speed Internet access at speeds of up to 1 Gbps, depending on the nature of the network facilities that are available, the level of service selected and the location. Our VoIP digital phone service is also available in certain markets\nOn June 8, 2015, we completed an offering of $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Senior Notes due 2022. The New Notes were priced at 98.26% of par with a yield to maturity of 6.80% and resulted in total gross proceeds of approximately $294.8 million, excluding accrued interest. The discount and deferred debt issuance costs of $4.5 million incurred in connection with the issuance of the New Notes are being amortized using the effective interest method over the term of the notes. The net proceeds from the issuance of the New Notes were used, in part, to redeem the remaining $227.2 million of our original $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 10.875% Senior Notes due 2020 and to pay related fees and expenses and to reduce the amount outstanding on the revolving credit facility. In connection with the redemption of the 2020 Notes, we paid $261.9 million and recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $41.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nVoice services include basic local phone and long-distance service packages for business customers. The plans include options for voicemail, conference calling, linking multiple office locations and other custom calling features such as caller ID, call forwarding, speed dialing and call waiting. Services can be charged at a fixed monthly rate, a measured rate or can be bundled with selected services at a discounted rate.\n\n (2) Expected settlements estimated using yield curves in effect at December 31, 2015. \n \u00b7 competitive access providers and commercial customers for network access service; and \nThroughout MD&A, we refer to certain measures that are not a measure of financial performance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( US GAAP\u201d or GAAP\u201d). We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures on a consolidated basis provides the reader with additional information that is useful in understanding our operating results and trends. These measures should be viewed in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, those measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a more detailed discussion on the use and calculation of these measures.\nNet cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations consists primarily of our proceeds and principal payments on long-term borrowings and the payment of dividends.\nCash Flows Used In Investing Activities\nvalue by 5%, the fair value of approximately $1.3 billion would decrease by approximately $314.0 million to approximately $995.0 million, which would not result in an impairment of goodwill. As discussed above, the other market-based approaches are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. Negative changes relating to the Company's operations could result in potential impairment of goodwill. Changes in the overall weighting of the DCF model and the market-based approach valuation models may also impact the resulting fair value and could result in potential impairment of goodwill.\nPension and postretirement benefits\nIn 2014, investment income decreased $3.2 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to lower earnings from our wireless partnership interests. Other, net decreased $0.5 million compared to 2013 due to bond solicitation fees of $0.5 million, and the sale of an office facility and other related assets in Pennsylvania that resulted in a non-cash loss of $0.8 million. Decreases were partially offset by a tentative settlement agreement of $0.9 million reached in a legal dispute in the prior year.\nRevenue recognition\nThe New Notes were issued as additional notes under the same indenture pursuant to which the $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Senior Notes due 2022 were previously issued on September 18, 2014. The Existing Notes were priced at par, which resulted in total gross proceeds of $200.0 million. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Existing Notes were used to finance the acquisition of Enventis, including related fees and expenses, and to repay the existing indebtedness of Enventis. A portion of the net proceeds, together with cash on hand and borrowings from the revolving credit facility, were also used to redeem $72.8 million of the original aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes in 2014.\nSelling, general and administrative costs increased $5.2 million during 2014 compared to 2013 primarily as a result of the addition of the operations for Enventis in 2014, which accounted for $7.2 million of the annual increase. Excluding Enventis, selling, general and administrative expense decreased $2.0 million due to a decline in professional fees for legal and billing services and a reduction in pension costs in 2014. These savings were offset in part by growth in our commercial sales force as a result of the expansion of our commercial services in the Dallas market in 2014. Bad debt expense also increased due to recoveries recognized in 2013.\nOn October 16, 2015, we completed an exchange offer to register all of the 2022 Notes under the Securities Act. The terms of the registered notes are substantially identical to those of the 2022 Notes prior to the exchange, except that the 2022 Notes are now registered under the Securities Act and the transfer restrictions and registration rights previously applicable to the original 2022 Notes do not apply to the registered 2022 Notes. The exchange offer did not impact the aggregate principal amount or the remaining terms of the 2022 Notes outstanding.\nCost of services and products increased $85.7 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the addition of the operations for Enventis during 2014, which accounted for $80.3 million of the increase. Video programming costs also increased $5.0 million as costs per program channel continue to rise. Video programming costs are impacted by license fees charged by cable networks, the amount and quality of the content we provide and the number of video subscribers we serve. We anticipate that programming costs will continue to increase due to the rising cost of license fees and as we add additional content and offer video content to various platforms. Network access costs also increased as a result of growth in carrier and wireless backhaul services. However, these increases were partially offset by a decline in employee costs due to a reduction in headcount.\nIn connection with the acquisition, in September 2014, we completed an offering of $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.50% senior notes due 2022 (the Existing Notes\u201d). The net proceeds from the issuance of the Existing Notes were used to finance the acquisition of Enventis, including related fees and expenses, and to pay the existing indebtedness of Enventis. A portion of the proceeds, together with cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility, was also used to redeem $72.8 million of our $300.0 million original aggregate principal amount of 10.875% Senior Notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes\u201d), as described in the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section below.\nIncome Taxes\n\nWe paid $78.2 million and $62.3 million in dividend payments to shareholders during 2015 and 2014, respectively. In November 2015, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.38738 per common share, which was paid on February 1, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business on January 15, 2016. In addition, on February 19, 2016, our board of directors declared its next quarterly dividend of $0.38738 per common share, which is payable on May 2, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business on April 15, 2016. Our current annual dividend rate is approximately $1.55 per share.\nIn general, telecommunications service in rural areas is more costly to provide than service in urban areas. The lower customer density means that switching and other facilities serve fewer customers and loops are typically longer, requiring\n\nReference is made Part I - Item 1 Note About Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Part I - Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d which describes important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and non-historical information contained herein. In addition, the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Consolidated Communications Holdings, Inc. ( Consolidated\u201d, the Company\u201d, we\u201d or our\u201d). MD&A should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements ( Notes\u201d) as of and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNetwork Access Services\nIssuance of Additional Senior Notes\nThe timing of cash payments for income taxes, which is governed by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing jurisdictions, will differ from the timing of recording tax expense and deferred income taxes, which are reported in accordance with GAAP. For example, tax laws in effect regarding accelerated or bonus\u201d depreciation for tax reporting resulted in less cash payments than the GAAP tax expense. Acceleration of tax deductions could eventually result in situations where cash payments will exceed GAAP tax expense.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into surety, performance, and similar bonds as required by certain jurisdictions in which we provide services. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $3.8 million of these bonds outstanding.\nIncome taxes decreased $4.5 million in 2014 compared to 2013. Our effective rate was 45.8% for 2014 compared to 36.9% for 2013. In 2014, we released the full $1.5 million valuation allowance and related deferred tax asset of $0.5 million maintained against the Federal NOL carryforwards subject to separate return limitation year restrictions and placed a valuation allowance on the state tax credit carryforwards of $0.5 million and related deferred tax asset of $0.3 million. The acquisition of Enventis on October 16, 2014 resulted in changes to our unitary state filings and correspondingly our state deferred income taxes. These changes resulted in a net increase of $2.1 million to our net state deferred tax liabilities and a corresponding increase to our state tax. In addition, we incurred non-deductible transaction costs in relation to the acquisition that resulted in an increase to our tax provision of $0.7 million. During 2013, we recognized $1.2 million of our previously unrecognized tax benefits, which resulted in a decrease to our tax expense of $0.8 million, due to the expiration of a state statute of limitations. We also recognized approximately $0.7 million of tax expense during 2013 to adjust our 2012 provision to match our 2012 returns. Exclusive of these adjustments, our effective tax rate for 2014 would have been approximately 36.6% compared to 37.1% for 2013.\nOur revolving credit facility has a maturity date of December 23, 2018 and an applicable margin (at our election) of between 2.50% and 3.25% for LIBOR-based borrowings or between 1.50% and 2.25% for alternate base rate borrowings, depending on our leverage ratio. Based on our leverage ratio at December 31, 2015, the borrowing margin for the next three month period ending March 31, 2016 will be at a weighted-average margin of 3.00% for a LIBOR-based loan or 2.00% for an alternate base rate loan. The applicable borrowing margin for the revolving credit facility is adjusted quarterly to reflect the leverage ratio from the prior quarter-end. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, borrowings of $10.0 million and $39.0 million, respectively, were outstanding under the revolving credit facility. A stand-by letter of credit of $1.6 million, issued in connection with the Company's insurance coverage, was outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2015. The stand-by letter of credit is renewable annually and reduces the borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2015, $63.4 million was available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility.\nWe are an integrated communications services company that operates as both an Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier ( ILEC\u201d) and a Competitive Local Exchange Carrier ( CLEC\u201d) dependent upon the territory served. We provide an array of services in consumer, commercial and carrier channels in 11 states, including local and long-distance service, high-speed broadband Internet access, video services, Voice over Internet Protocol ( VoIP\u201d), custom calling features, private line services, carrier grade access services, network capacity services over our regional fiber optic networks, data center and managed services, directory publishing, equipment sales and cloud data services.\nIn addition, the PUCT is required to develop a needs test for post-2017 funding and has held workshops on various proposals. The PUCT issued its recommendation to the Texas state commissioners in May 2014, which was approved in December 2014. The needs test allows for a one-time disaggregation of line rates from a per line flat rate, then a competitive test must be met to receive funding. The deadline for submission of the needs test is December 31, 2016. We expect to complete the needs test as required and file for continued funding by the 2016 deadline.\nIn 2014, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Enventis for shares of our common stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares. The purchase price consisted of cash and the repayment of debt of $139.6 million, net of cash acquired, and the issuance of shares of the Company's common stock valued at $257.7 million. The funds required to repay Enventis' outstanding debt was financed in part with the sale of $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Senior Notes due 2022, as described below.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIncome taxes decreased $10.2 million in 2015 compared to 2014. Our effective rate was 131.9% for 2015 compared to 45.8% for 2014. In 2015, we placed additional valuation allowances on state NOL and state tax credit carryforwards of $3.9 million and $1.1 million, respectively, and related deferred tax asset of $0.2 million and $0.7 million, respectively. We also recorded a net increase of $1.9 million to our net state deferred tax liabilities and a corresponding increase to our state tax expense due to changes in state deferred income tax rates. In 2014, we released the full $1.5 million valuation allowance and related deferred tax asset of $0.5 million maintained against the Federal NOL carryforwards subject to separate return limitation year restrictions and placed a valuation allowance on the state tax credit carryforwards of $0.5 million and related deferred tax asset of $0.3 million. The acquisition of Enventis on October 16, 2014 resulted in changes to our unitary state filings and correspondingly our state deferred income taxes. These changes resulted in a net increase of $2.1 million to our net state deferred tax liabilities and a corresponding increase to our state tax. In addition, we incurred non-deductible transaction costs in relation to the acquisition that resulted in an increase to our tax provision of $0.7 million. Exclusive of these adjustments, our effective tax rate for 2015 would have been approximately 7.9% compared to 36.6% for 2014. The 2015 effective tax rate differed from the federal and state statutory rates primarily due to state tax credits and differences in allocable income for the Company's state tax filings.\nTexas\nSubsidies revenue increased $1.2 million during 2014 compared to 2013 primarily from the addition of Enventis revenue.\nSurety Bonds\nThe following table summarizes our indebtedness as of December 31, 2015:\nThe cost to maintain our Pension Plans and future funding requirements are affected by several factors including the expected return on investment of the assets held by the Pension Plan, changes in the discount rate used to calculate pension expense and the amortization of unrecognized gains and losses. Returns generated on Plan assets have historically funded a significant portion of the benefits paid under the Pension Plans. For 2015, the estimated long-term rate of return of Plan assets was 8.00%. As of January 1, 2016, we estimate that the long-term rate of return of Plan assets will be 7.75%. The Pension Plans invest in marketable equity securities which are exposed to changes in the financial markets. If the financial markets experience a downturn and returns fall below our estimate, we could be required to make a material contribution to the Pension Plan, which could adversely affect our cash flows from operations.\nbe lifted effective September 1, 2013 and (ii) rural and urban local rate benchmarks be developed. The large company fund review was completed in September 2012 and the PUCT addressed the small fund participants in Docket 41097 Rate Rebalancing ( Docket 41097\u201d), as discussed below.\nIn addition to the results reported in accordance with US GAAP, we also use certain non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to evaluate operating performance and to facilitate the comparison of our historical results and trends. These financial measures are not a measure of financial performance under US GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income as a measure of performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. They are not, on their own, necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as determined in accordance with GAAP. The calculation of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP are provided below.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\n (1) Other, net includes the equity earnings from our investments, dividend income, income attributable to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries, acquisition and transaction related costs including severance and certain other miscellaneous items. \nAmong other matters, the 2022 Notes indenture provides that CCI may not pay dividends or make other restricted payments, as defined in the indenture, if its total net leverage ratio is 4.75:1.00 or greater. This ratio is calculated differently than the comparable ratio under the Credit Agreement; among other differences, it takes into account, on a pro forma basis, synergies expected to be achieved as a result of certain acquisitions not yet reflected in historical results. At December 31, 2015, this ratio was 4.33:1.00. If this ratio is met, dividends and other restricted payments may be made from cumulative consolidated cash flow since April 1, 2012, less 1.75 times fixed charges, less dividends and other restricted payments made since May 30, 2012. Dividends may be paid and other restricted payments may also be made from a basket\u201d of $50.0 million, none of which has been used to date, and pursuant to other exceptions identified in the indenture. Since dividends of $253.1 million have been paid since May 30, 2012, including the quarterly dividend declared in November 2015 and paid on February 1, 2016, there was $351.5 million of the $604.6 million of cumulative consolidated cash flow since May 30, 2012 available to pay dividends as of December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with all terms, conditions and covenants under the indenture governing the 2022 Notes.\nof our cash flow to fund capital expenditures, meet scheduled payments of long-term debt, make dividend payments and to invest in future business opportunities.\nWe lease certain facilities and equipment under various capital leases which expire between 2015 and 2021. As of December 31, 2015, the present value of the minimum remaining lease commitments was approximately $7.6 million, of which $1.8 million was due and payable within the next twelve months. The leases require total remaining rental payments of $9.4 million as of December 31, 2015, of which $4.3 million will be paid to LATEL LLC, a related party entity.\nOther products and services include revenues from telephone directory publishing, video advertising and billing and support services. Other products and services revenue increased $3.5 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily from the addition of Enventis revenue of $3.9 million for its billing and support services and an increase in video advertising revenues, which was offset by a decline in directory publishing revenue.\nKey Operating Statistics\nOn September 13, 2013, we completed the sale of the assets and contractual rights used to provide communications services to thirteen county jails located in Illinois. The sale was completed for an aggregate purchase price of $2.5 million, resulting in a gain of $1.3 million, net of tax. The financial results of the operations for our prison services business have been reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nUnder our credit agreement, if our total net leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement), as of the end of any fiscal quarter, is greater than 5.10:1.00, we will be required to suspend dividends on our common stock unless otherwise permitted by an exception for dividends that may be paid from the portion of proceeds of any sale of equity not used to fund acquisitions, or make other investments. During any dividend suspension period, we will be required to repay debt in an amount equal to 50.0% of any increase in Available Cash, among other things. In addition, we will not be permitted to pay dividends if an event of default under the credit agreement has occurred and is continuing. Among other things, it will be an event of default if our total net leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter is greater than 5.25:1.00 and less than 2.25:1.00, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, our total net leverage ratio under the credit agreement was 4.23:1.00, and our interest coverage ratio was 4.12:1.00.\n\ngreater expenditures per customer to build and maintain. By supporting the high-cost of operations in rural markets, Universal Service Fund ( USF\u201d) subsidies promote widely available, quality telephone service at affordable prices in rural areas. Revenues from the federal and certain states' USFs increased $3.2 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the acquisition of Enventis in October 2014.\nOur significant accounting policies and estimates are discussed in the Notes to our consolidated financial statements. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management's application of our accounting policies. Our judgments are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, because future events and the related effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from our estimates and assumptions and such differences could be material. Management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.\nContractual Obligations\nSelling, general and administrative costs increased $37.6 million during 2015 compared to 2014. The acquisition of Enventis in 2014 contributed $29.7 million of the increase. In addition, as part of the Company's continued integration efforts, an early retirement program was initiated during 2015 to a group of select employees who were 55 years of age or older and who have provided 15 or more years of service. The employees were primarily in non-customer facing positions or positions in which the Company believed the retiree's workload could be absorbed internally as part of the Company's continuing cost saving initiatives. The early retirement package was accepted by approximately 60 employees and, as a result, one-time severance costs of $7.2 million were incurred in 2015. The Company expects approximately $4.8 million in future annual savings as a result of the early retirement program. The remaining increase in selling, general and administrative costs was primarily due to an increase in property taxes and regulatory fees and increased pension costs in the current year. These increases were offset in part by a decline in employee-related costs and a reduction in advertising expense in 2015.\nOperating Expenses\nIncome Taxes\nCapital Leases\nOutlook and Overview\nSubject to certain exceptions and qualifications, the indenture governing the 2022 Notes contains customary covenants that, among other things, limits CCI's and its restricted subsidiaries' ability to: incur additional debt or issue certain preferred stock; pay dividends or make other distributions on capital stock or prepay subordinated indebtedness; purchase or redeem any equity interests; make investments; create liens; sell assets; enter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments by restricted subsidiaries; consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its assets; engage in transactions with its affiliates; or enter into any sale and leaseback transactions. The indenture also contains customary events of default.\nWe offer several different basic local phone service packages and long-distance calling plans, including unlimited flat-rate calling plans. The plans include options for voicemail and other custom calling features such as caller ID, call forwarding and call waiting. Voice services revenue increased $0.4 million during 2015 compared to 2014 and decreased $3.7 million during 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding the addition of Enventis revenue of $5.5 million and $1.5 million, respectively, voice services revenue decreased $5.1 million and $5.2 million, respectively, primarily due to a 9% and 13% decline in voice connections, respectively. The number of local access lines in service directly affects the recurring revenue we generate from end users and continues to be impacted by the industry-wide decline in access lines. We expect to continue to experience modest erosion in voice connections due to competition from alternative technologies, including our own competing VoIP product.\nThrough our acquisition of Enventis in 2014, we obtained a leading market relationship with Cisco Systems, Inc. and, as a result, are an accredited Master Level Unified Communications and Gold Certified Cisco Partner providing equipment solutions and support for business customers. As an equipment integrator, we offer network design, implementation and support services, including maintenance contracts, in order to provide integrated communication solutions for our customers. When an equipment sale involves multiple deliverables, revenue is allocated to each respective element based on relative selling price. Equipment sales and services are non-recurring and changes in revenue can be attributed to the timing and volume of customer sales, which can vary each quarter and result in positive or negative fluctuations in our quarterly operating revenues and expenses. Equipment sales and service revenue increased $45.0 million during 2015 compared to 2014 and $10.0 million during 2014 compared to 2013 due to the acquisition of Enventis.\nFCC Matters\nBalance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet. The adoption of this guidance resulted in the reclassification of approximately $12.4 million of net deferred tax assets from current assets to noncurrent net deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2015. Prior period amounts were not retrospectively adjusted.\nTo the extent that our business plans or projections change or prove to be inaccurate, we may require additional financing or require financing sooner than we currently anticipate. Sources of additional financing may include commercial bank borrowings, other strategic debt financing, sales of nonstrategic assets, vendor financing or the private or public sales of equity and debt securities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future, that anticipated revenue growth will be realized, or that future borrowings or equity issuances will be available in amounts sufficient to provide adequate sources of cash to fund our expected uses of cash. Failure to obtain adequate financing, if necessary, could require us to significantly reduce our operations or level of capital expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the results of operations.\nEBITDA is defined as net earnings before interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is comprised of EBITDA, adjusted for certain items as permitted or required under our credit facility as described in the reconciliations below. These measures are a common measure of operating performance in the telecommunications industry and are useful, with other data, as a means to evaluate our ability to fund our estimated uses of cash.\nInterest Expense, Net\nOur interest rate swaps are measured using valuation models which rely on quoted market prices and observable market data of similar instruments. The valuation models require estimates of future interest rates and judgments about the future credit worthiness of the Company and each counterparty over the terms of the contracts.\nThe following tables are a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nThe credit agreement contains various provisions and covenants, including, among other items, restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, incur additional indebtedness, and issue capital stock. We have agreed to maintain certain financial ratios, including interest coverage and total net leverage ratios, all as defined in the credit agreement. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the credit agreement covenants.\nNon-Operating Items\nEnventis Merger\n \u00b7 1.0% terminal growth rate. \nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nInterest expense, net of interest income, decreased $2.9 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a reduction in the interest rate for our outstanding senior notes. In June 2015, we issued an additional $300.0 million in 6.50% Senior Notes due 2022, which were used, in part, to redeem our outstanding 10.875% Senior Notes due 2020, as described below. The New Notes were issued as an add-on to the $200.0 million in 6.50% Senior Notes issued in September 2014, the proceeds of which were used, in part, to fund the acquisition of Enventis in October 2014. Interest expense was also reduced in 2015 by declines in non-cash interest expense related to our de-designated interest rate swap agreements and additional financing costs in 2014 related to the bridge loan facility obtained for the Enventis acquisition.\nIn an ongoing proceeding relating to the New Regulatory Framework, the CPUC adopted Decision 06-08-030 in 2006, which grants carriers broader pricing freedom in the provision of telecommunications services, bundling of services, promotions and customer contracts. This decision adopted a new regulatory framework, the Uniform Regulatory Framework ( URF\u201d), which among other things (i) eliminates price regulation and allows full pricing flexibility for all new and retail services, (ii) allows new forms of bundles and promotional packages of telecommunication services, (iii) allocates all gains and losses from the sale of assets to shareholders and (iv) eliminates almost all elements of rate of return regulation, including the calculation of shareable earnings. In December 2010, the CPUC issued a ruling to initiate a new proceeding to assess whether, or to what extent, the level of competition in the telecommunications industry is sufficient to control prices for the four largest ILECs in the state. Subsequently, the CPUC issued a ruling temporarily deferring the proceeding. When the CPUC may open this proceeding is unclear and on hold at this time. The CPUC's actions in this and future proceedings could lead to new rules and an increase in government regulation. The Company will continue to monitor this matter.\nAs discussed in the Regulatory Matters\u201d section above, in December 2014, the FCC released a report and order that significantly impacts the amount of support revenue we receive from the USF, CAF and ICC by redirecting support from voice services to broadband services. Our annual funding under CAF Phase I of $36.6 million will be replaced by annual funding under CAF Phase II of $13.9 million through 2020. In the state of Iowa, where CAF Phase II funding is greater than the CAF Phase I funding, the CAF Phase II funding will be received with a retroactive payment back to January 1, 2015. For all other states, funding under CAF Phase II is less than funding under CAF Phase I. The acceptance of funding at the lower level will transition over a three year period, beginning in August 2015, at the rates of 75% of the CAF Phase I funding level in the first year, 50% in the second year and 25% in the third year. For the period from August 2015 through December 2015, the Company received and recognized approximately $6.4 million in total CAF Phase II funding, which includes the retroactive payment for Iowa of approximately $0.6 million.\n \u00b7 business and residential subscribers of basic exchange services; \nRelated Party Transactions\nIn accordance with the provisions of SB 583, as discussed in the Regulatory Matters\u201d section above, our annual $1.4 million Texas HCAF support was eliminated effective January 1, 2014. In addition, in accordance with the provisions of the settlement agreement reached with the PUCT, the HCF draw will be reduced by approximately $1.2 million annually over a four year period beginning June 1, 2014 through 2018. However, we have the ability to fully offset this reduction with increases to residential rates where market conditions allow, which the Company filed for and implemented in 2014 and 2015.\n (3) Unrecorded purchase obligations include binding commitments for future capital expenditures and service and maintenance agreements to support various computer hardware and software applications and certain equipment. If we terminate any of the contracts prior to their expiration date, we would be liable for minimum commitment payments as defined by the contractual terms of the contracts. \nCalifornia\nAn order adopted by the FCC in 2011 (the Order\u201d) will significantly impact the amount of support revenue we receive from the USF, Connect America Fund ( CAF\u201d) and ICC. The Order reformed core parts of the USF, broadly recast the existing ICC scheme, established the CAF to replace support revenues provided by the current USF and redirected support from voice services to broadband services. In 2012, CAF Phase I was implemented, which froze USF support to price cap carriers until the FCC implemented a broadband cost model to shift support from voice services to broadband services. The Order also modified the methodology used for ICC traffic exchanged between carriers. The initial phase of ICC reform was effective on July 1, 2012, beginning the transition of our terminating switched access rates to bill-and-keep over a seven year period, and as a result, our network access revenue decreased approximately $1.3 million during 2015.\n \u00b7 long distance carriers for network access service; \nOur net working capital position improved $4.0 million as of December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of an increase in cash and cash equivalents due in part to a decline in accounts receivable and additional cash distributions from our wireless partnerships in the current year. Income tax receivable also increased primarily due to the loss on the extinguishment of debt recognized in 2015. The improvement in working capital was also due to a decline in current liabilities as a result of a decrease in accrued compensation at December 31, 2015. The change in working capital was also impacted by the adoption as of December 31, 2015 of Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17 ( ASU 2015-17\u201d),\nCost of Services and Products\nEquipment Sales and Service\nalternative communications services and competition for these subscribers continues to increase. Excluding the increase in voice connections as a result of the acquisition of Enventis in 2014, total voice connections decreased 5% as of December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014. Competition from wireless providers, competitive local exchange carriers and, in some cases, cable television providers has increased in recent years in the markets we serve. We have been able to mitigate some of the access line losses through marketing initiatives and product offerings, such as our VoIP service. In addition, our video connection growth is decelerating. Excluding Enventis, total video connections decreased 6% as of December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014. The consumer's growing acceptance of OTT video services either to augment their current viewing options or to entirely replace their video subscription may impact our future video subscriber base, which could result in a decline in video revenue as well as a reduction in video programing costs. We believe this trend in changing consumer viewing habits will continue to impact our business model and strategy of providing consumers the necessary broadband speed to facilitate OTT content viewing.\n \u00b7 6.0% weighted average cost of capital based on comparable public companies and adjusting for risks unique to our business and the cash flow assumptions utilized in the analysis; and \nThe following tables reflect our financial results on a consolidated basis and key operating statistics as of and for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nBroadband Services\nNet cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $119.5 million during 2015, a decrease of $127.3 million from 2014 primarily due to cash used for the acquisition of Enventis in 2014.\n (1) Interest on long-term debt includes amounts due on fixed and variable rate debt. As the rates on our variable debt are subject to change, the rates in effect at December 31, 2015 were used in determining our future interest obligations. \nSubsidies\nWe use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage the risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and to convert a portion of future cash flows associated with the interest to be paid on our credit facility from a floating rate to a fixed rate. All derivative financial statements are recognized in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. For the derivative financial instruments designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of interest expense in the period in which the hedged item affects earnings. Any ineffectiveness is recognized immediately in earnings. For derivative financial instruments not designated as a cash flow hedge or have been determined to no longer be effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item and have been de-designated, then the changes in the market value of these instruments are recorded in the statement of operations as a component of interest expense.\nOn October 16, 2015, we completed an exchange offer to register all of the 2022 Notes under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d). The terms of the registered 2022 Notes are substantially identical to the 2022 Notes prior to the exchange, except that the notes are now registered under the Securities Act and the transfer restrictions and registration rights applicable to the original 2022 Notes no longer apply to the registered 2022 Notes. The exchange offer did not impact the aggregate principal amount or the remaining terms of the 2022 Notes outstanding.\nData and Transport Services\nDividends\nOther products and services revenue decreased $0.1 million during 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding the addition of Enventis revenue of $1.4 million, other products and services revenue decreased $1.5 million primarily due to a decline in directory publishing revenue.\nSenior Notes\nState Matters\nSignificant Recent Developments\nBroadband services revenue increased $12.8 million during 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the addition of Enventis revenue of $13.5 million, broadband services revenue decreased $0.7 million primarily due to an 8% decline in video connections and increased discounts on our data service offerings. We expect data revenue to grow as a result of the rising consumer demand for data-based services. However, the revenue growth was tempered by a decrease in VoIP revenue during that same period due to a decline in voice connections as more consumers have begun to rely exclusively on wireless service.\nInvestment income increased $2.2 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in earnings from our wireless partnership interests, which was reduced in part by an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $0.8 million during 2015 as a result of the sale of our equity interest in Central Valley Independent Network, LLC. Other, net decreased $0.6 million compared to 2014 primarily due to additional reserves related to disputed tax assessments recognized in 2015.\nBroadband services revenue increased $5.7 million during 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding the addition of Enventis revenue of $3.4 million, broadband services revenue increased $2.3 million primarily due to growth in Internet access revenue and video subscriptions revenue.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our contractual obligations were as follows:\nTradenames\nFunctional management within the organization evaluates the operations of our single reporting unit on a consolidated basis rather than at a geographic level or on any other component basis. In general, product managers and cost managers are responsible for managing costs and services across territories rather than treating the territories as separate business units. The operations of our Illinois, Texas, Pennsylvania, California, Kansas and Missouri properties share network operations monitoring call routing and research and development costs and share remittance, customer service and billing systems. In connection with our recent acquisition of Enventis in October 2014, the functional realignment occurred shortly after close. The continued integration of the various systems and processes in place at Enventis will occur over the next several quarters. All of the properties are managed at a functional level. In addition, the Pennsylvania territories receive their video programming from a video head-end located in the Illinois territory, and all of the networks provide redundancy. As a result, we evaluate the operations for all our service territories as a single reporting unit.\nIn 2014, we redeemed $72.8 million of the original aggregate principal amount of our 10.875% Senior Notes due 2020, as described in the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section below. In connection with the redemption of the 2020 Notes, we paid $84.1 million and recognized a loss of $13.8 million on the partial extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2014. In 2015, we redeemed the remaining $227.2 million of the 2020 Notes for $261.9 million and recognized a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $41.2 million during 2015.\n\nRevenues increased $140.0 million during 2015 compared to 2014, primarily from growth in commercial services, total data connections and the acquisition of Enventis Corporation ( Enventis\u201d) in October 2014, as described below. We generate the majority of our consolidated operating revenues primarily from subscriptions to our video, data and transport services (collectively broadband services\u201d) to business and residential customers. We expect our broadband services revenue to continue to grow as consumer and commercial demands for data based services increase.\nthree year period based on the CAF Phase I funding levels at the rates of 75% in the first year, 50% in the second year and 25% in the third year. For the period from August 2015 through December 2015, the Company received and recognized approximately $6.4 million in total CAF Phase II funding, which includes the retroactive payment for Iowa of approximately $0.6 million.\nDerivatives\nThe Term 4 loan was issued in an original aggregate principal amount of $910.0 million with a maturity date of December 23, 2020. The Term 4 loan contains an original issuance discount of $4.6 million, which is being amortized over the term of the loan. The Term 4 loan requires quarterly principal payments of $2.3 million, which commenced March 31, 2014, and has an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.25% subject to a 1.00% LIBOR floor.\nFor information regarding the impact of certain recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 Business Description & Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated Financial Statements included in this report in Part II -Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d.\nOur Texas ILECs have historically received support from two state funds, the small and rural incumbent local exchange company plan High Cost Fund ( HCF\u201d) and the High Cost Assistance Fund ( HCAF\u201d). The HCF is a line-based fund used to keep local rates low. The rate is applied on all residential lines and up to five single business lines. The amount we receive from the HCAF is a frozen monthly amount that was originally developed to offset high intrastate toll rates.\nNetwork access services include interstate and intrastate switched access revenue, network special access services and end user access. Switched access revenue includes access services to other communications carriers to terminate or originate long-distance calls on our network. Special access circuits provide dedicated lines and trunks to business customers and interexchange carriers. Network access services revenue decreased $1.8 million during 2015 compared to 2014 and $5.7\nOur most significant use of funds in 2016 is expected to be for: (i) dividend payments of between $78.0 million and $80.0 million; (ii) interest payments on our indebtedness of between $73.0 million and $75.0 million and principal payments on debt of $9.1 million; and (iii) capital expenditures of between $125.0 million and $130.0 million. In the future, our ability to use cash may be limited by our other expected uses of cash, including our dividend policy, and our ability to incur additional debt will be limited by our existing and future debt agreements.\nEnventis is an advanced communications provider, which services consumer, commercial and wholesale carrier customer channels primarily in the upper Midwest. The acquisition reflects our strategy to diversify revenue and cash flows amongst multiple products and to expand our network to new markets. The financial results for Enventis have been included in our consolidated financial statements as of the acquisition date.\nAs discussed more fully in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, goodwill is not amortized but instead evaluated for impairment annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate potential impairment, for impairment using a preliminary qualitative assessment and two-step quantitative process, if deemed necessary. The evaluation of goodwill may first include a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Events and circumstances integrated into the qualitative assessment process include a combination of macroeconomic conditions affecting equity and credit markets, significant changes to the cost structure, overall financial performance and other relevant events affecting the reporting unit. A company is permitted to skip the qualitative assessment at its election, and proceed to step one of the quantitative test, which we chose to do in 2015.\nOther Income\nOperating Revenues\nData and transport services revenue increased $65.8 million during 2015 compared to 2014 and $23.0 million during 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding the addition of Enventis revenue of $57.5 million and $14.1 million, respectively, data and transport services revenue increased $8.3 million and $8.9 million, respectively, primarily from growth in data connections and a continued increase in VoIP, Internet access and Metro Ethernet revenue. Fiber transport and cellular backhaul revenue also increased as network bandwidth demand for wireless data continues to escalate.\nA one percentage-point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have the following effects on net periodic benefit cost:\nIn December 2013, the Company, through certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries, entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with various financial institutions (the Credit Agreement\u201d) to replace the Company's previously amended credit agreement. The Credit Agreement consists of a $75.0 million revolving credit facility and initial term loans in the aggregate amount of $910.0 million ( Term 4\u201d). The Credit Agreement also includes an incremental term loan facility which provides the ability to request to borrow up to $300.0 million of incremental term loans subject to certain terms and conditions. Borrowings under the senior secured credit facility are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, with the exception of Consolidated Communications of Illinois Company (formerly known as Illinois Consolidated Telephone Company) and our majority-owned subsidiary, East Texas Fiber Line Incorporated.\nOur exceptional consumer broadband speed allows us to continue to meet the needs of our customers and the demand for higher speed resulting from the growing trend of over-the-top ( OTT\u201d) content viewing. The availability of 1 Gbps data speed also complements our wireless home networking ( Wi-Fi\u201d) that supports our TV Everywhere service and allows our subscribers to watch their favorite programs at home or away on a computer, smartphone or tablet.\nThe carrying value of our tradenames, excluding any finite lived tradenames, was $10.6 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we completed our annual impairment test using a DCF methodology based on a relief from royalty method and determined that there was no impairment of our tradename.\nIn June 2013, the Texas state legislature passed Senate Bill No. 583 ( SB 583\u201d). The provisions of SB 583 were effective September 1, 2013 and froze HCF and HCAF support for the remainder of 2013. As of January 1, 2014, our annual $1.4 million HCAF support was eliminated and the frozen HCF support returned to funding on a per line basis. In July 2013, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the PUCT on Docket 41097, which was approved by the PUCT in August 2013. In accordance with the provisions of the settlement agreement, the HCF draw will be reduced by approximately $1.2 million annually over a four year period beginning June 1, 2014 through 2018. However, we have the ability to fully offset this reduction with increases to residential rates where market conditions allow, which the Company filed for in April 2014 and implemented in June 2014.\n (1) A non-GAAP measure. See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for additional information and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. \n \u00b7 cash flow assumptions regarding investment in network facilities, distribution channels and customer base (the assumptions underlying these inputs are based upon a combination of historical results and trends, new industry developments and the Company's business plans); \nWe believe that cash flows from operating activities, together with our existing cash and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient for at least the next twelve months to fund our current anticipated uses of cash. After that, our ability to fund these expected uses of cash and to comply with the financial covenants under our debt agreements will depend on the results of future operations, performance and cash flow. Our ability to fund these expected uses from the results of future operations will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, regulatory, legislative and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\n\nNet proceeds from asset sales exceeding certain thresholds, to the extent not reinvested, are required to be used to repay loans outstanding under the credit agreement.\nOverview\nNet pension and post-retirement (benefit)/costs were $(2.2) million, $(5.5) million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We contributed $12.2 million, $11.1 million and $11.5 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively to our pension plans. For our other post-retirement plans, we contributed $3.0 million, $2.7 million and $2.8 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In 2016, we expect to make contributions totaling approximately $0.3 million to our non-qualified supplemental retirement plans and $3.6 million to our other post-retirement benefit plans. We do not expect to contribute to our qualified defined pension plans in 2016. Our contribution amounts meet the minimum funding requirements as set forth in employee benefit and tax laws. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion regarding our pension and other post-retirement plans.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n6.50% Senior Notes due 2022\nAt the federal level, the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC\u201d) generally exercises jurisdiction over facilities and services of local exchange carriers, such as our rural telephone companies, to the extent they are used to provide, originate or terminate interstate or international communications. The FCC has the authority to condition, modify, cancel, terminate or revoke our operating authority for failure to comply with applicable federal laws or FCC rules, regulations and policies. Fines or penalties also may be imposed for any of these violations.\nDiscontinued Operations\nPennsylvania\nOur current and deferred income taxes and associated valuation allowances are impacted by events and transactions arising in the normal course of business as well as in connection with the adoption of new accounting standards, acquisitions of businesses and non-recurring items. Assessment of the appropriate amount and classification of income taxes is dependent on several factors, including estimates of the timing and realization of deferred income tax assets and the timing of income tax payments. Actual amounts may materially differ from these estimates as a result of changes in tax laws as well as unanticipated future transactions impacting related income tax balances. We account for tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in accordance with the accounting guidance applicable for uncertainty in income taxes, which requires the use of a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.\nAt November 30, 2015, the fair value of the single reporting unit's total equity was estimated at approximately $1.3 billion on a control basis, and the associated carrying value of its equity was $269.8 million. For all valuation methods used, the fair value of equity exceeds its carrying value. The use of different estimates or assumptions in the DCF model could result in a different fair value conclusion. As a sensitivity calculation, if the discount rate in our DCF model was increased 1.0 percentage point from 6.0% to 7.0%, the fair value would decrease from approximately $1.3 billion to approximately $1.2 billion, which would not result in an impairment of goodwill, assuming there are no changes to the market-based approaches used in the valuation. Assuming the discount rate in our DCF model was increased 2.0 percentage points, the terminal growth rate decreased by 0.05 percentage point, and each of the market-based valuation approaches decreased in\nRegulatory Matters\nWe may be unable to access the cash flows of our subsidiaries since certain of our subsidiaries are parties to credit or other borrowing agreements, or subject to statutory or regulatory restrictions, that restrict the payment of dividends or making intercompany loans and investments, and those subsidiaries are likely to continue to be subject to such restrictions and prohibitions for the foreseeable future. In addition, future agreements that our subsidiaries may enter into governing the terms of indebtedness may restrict our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends or advance cash in any other manner to us.\nRegulatory Matters\nIn determining the appropriate discount rate, we consider the current yields on high-quality corporate fixed-income investments with maturities that correspond to the expected duration of our pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations. For our 2015 and 2014 projected benefit obligations, we used a discount rate of 4.76% and 4.27%, respectively, for our pension plans and 4.61% and 4.11%, respectively, for our other postretirement plans.\nWe recognize certain revenues pursuant to various cost recovery programs from federal and state USF. Revenues are calculated based on our estimates and assumptions regarding various financial data, including operating expenses, taxes and investment in property, plant and equipment. Non-financial data estimates are also utilized, including projected demand usage and detailed network information. We must also make estimates of the jurisdictional separation of this data to assign current financial and operating data to the interstate or intrastate jurisdiction. These estimates are finalized in future periods as actual data becomes available to complete the separation studies. We have historically collected revenues recognized through these programs; however, adjustments to estimated revenues in future periods are possible. These adjustments could be necessitated by adverse regulatory developments with respect to these subsidies and revenue sharing arrangements, changes in allowable rates of return and the determination of recoverable costs, or decreases in the availability of funds in the programs due to increased participation by other carriers.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nOn October 16, 2014, we completed our merger with Enventis and acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of Enventis in exchange for shares of our common stock. As a result, Enventis became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The total value of the purchase consideration exchanged was $257.7 million, excluding $149.9 million paid to extinguish Enventis' outstanding debt. On the date of the merger, we issued an aggregate total of 10.1 million shares of our common stock to the former Enventis shareholders.\nWe are also subject to a number of regulatory proceedings occurring at the federal and state levels that may have a material impact on our operations. The FCC and state commissions have authority to issue rules and regulations related to our business. A number of proceedings are pending or anticipated that are related to such telecommunications issues as competition, interconnection, access charges, intercarrier compensation, broadband deployment, consumer protection and universal service reform. Some proceedings may authorize new services to compete with our existing services. Proceedings that relate to our cable television operations include rulemakings on set top boxes, carriage of programming, industry consolidation and ways to promote additional competition. There are various on-going legal challenges to the scope or validity of FCC orders that have been issued. As a result, it is not yet possible to fully determine the impact of the related FCC rules and regulations on our operations.\nOur pension investment strategy is to maximize long-term returns on invested plan assets while minimizing the risk of volatility. Accordingly, we target our allocation percentage at approximately 60% in equity funds, with the remainder in fixed income and cash equivalents. Our assumed rate considers this investment mix as well as past trends. We used an expected long-term rate of return of 8.00% in 2015 and 2014. As of January 1, 2016, we estimate that the long-term rate of return of pension plan assets will be 7.75%.\nOur operating requirements have historically been funded from cash flows generated from our business and borrowings under our credit facilities. We expect that our future operating requirements will continue to be funded from cash flows from operating activities, existing cash and cash equivalents, and, if needed, from borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our ability to obtain future external financing. We anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion\nThe increase in our operating revenues during 2015 was offset, in part, by an anticipated industry-wide trend of a decline in consumer voice services, access lines and related network access. Many consumers are choosing to subscribe to\nVoice Services\nIn 2013, we amended our Credit Agreement to restate and amend our term loan credit facilities. In connection with entering into the amended and restated credit agreement, we incurred a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $7.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nmillion during 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding the addition of Enventis revenue of $6.0 million and $1.7 million, respectively, network access services revenue decreased $7.8 million and $7.4 million, respectively, primarily due to declines in switched and special access revenues. Special access revenue decreased primarily due to a reduction in the number of our carrier circuits; however, a portion of the decrease can be attributed to carriers shifting to our fiber Metro Ethernet product, contributing to the growth in that area. Switched access revenue decreased primarily as a result of the continuing decline in minutes of use and voice connections.\nSenior Notes Covenant Compliance\nWe market services to our residential customers either individually or as a bundled package. Our triple play\u201d bundle includes our voice, video and data services. Data connections continue to increase as a result of consumer trends toward increased Internet usage and our enhanced product and service offerings, such as our progressively increasing consumer data speeds. We introduced data speeds of up to 1 Gbps to approximately 20,000 of our fiber-to-the-home customers in our Kansas market and a limited portion of our Pennsylvania market in December 2014 and in our Texas market in the first quarter of 2015, with our California market to follow in 2016. Where 1 Gbps speeds are not yet offered, the maximum broadband speed is 100 Mbps, depending on the geographic market availability. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 29% of the homes in the areas we serve subscribe to our data service.\nOther Products and Services\n \u00b7 support payments from federal or state programs. \nIn general, our credit agreement restricts our ability to pay dividends to the amount of our Available Cash as defined in our credit agreement. As of December 31, 2015 and including the $19.6 million dividend declared in November 2015 and paid on February 1, 2016, we had $245.9 million in dividend availability under the credit facility covenant.\nOther Regulatory Matters\nDecember 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, gains of $0.8 million, $1.6 million and $2.2 million, respectively, were recognized as a reduction to interest expense for the change in fair value of the de-designated swaps.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nCapital Expenditures\nThe 2022 Notes mature on October 1, 2022 and interest is payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year. Consolidated Communications, Inc. ( CCI\u201d) is the primary obligor under the 2022 Notes, and we and certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the 2022 Notes. The 2022 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company.\nAcquisition and Other Transaction Costs\n (1) At December 31, 2015, the 1-month London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) applicable to our borrowings was 0.42%. The Term 4 loan is subject to a 1.00% LIBOR floor. \nThe comparability of our consolidated results of operations and key operating statistics was impacted by the Enventis acquisition that closed on October 16, 2014, as described above. Enventis' results are included in our consolidated financial statements as of the date of the acquisition. The acquisition provides additional diversification of the Company's revenues and cash flows both geographically and by service type.\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $219.2 million in 2015, an increase of $31.4 million as compared to 2014. Cash provided by operating activities increased primarily as a result of the additional cash flows provided by the addition of the Enventis operations as well as an increase in cash distributions from our wireless partnerships in 2015. These increases were offset in part by changes in working capital primarily due to the timing in receipts for accounts receivable, a decline in advance billings related to equipment sales and a decline in accounts payable related to the timing in payments to suppliers.\nWe provide a variety of business communication services to small, medium and large business customers, including many services over our advanced fiber network. The services we offer include scalable high speed broadband Internet access and VoIP phone services which range from basic service plans to virtual hosted systems. In addition to Internet and VoIP services, we also offer private line data services to businesses that include dedicated Internet access through our Metro Ethernet network. Wide Area Network ( WAN\u201d) products include point-to-point and multi-point deployments from 2.5 Mbps to 10 Gbps to accommodate the growth patterns of our business customers. Data center and disaster recovery solutions provide a reliable and local colocation option for commercial customers. We also offer wholesale services to regional and national interexchange and wireless carriers, including cellular backhaul and other fiber transport solutions.\nIn March 2015, the FCC released its net neutrality order which applies to all wireline and wireless providers of broadband internet access services. The net neutrality order addresses several areas that will be regulated and others that are subject to forbearance. The regulations disallow blocking, throttling and paid prioritization by internet service providers. The net neutrality order also requires providers to disclose certain information to consumers on rates, fees, data allowances and packet loss. Finally, it gives the FCC codified enforcement authority and it forbears on certain Title II regulations. We are evaluating the net neutrality order, and we currently do not believe the order will result in any significant changes to the services we provide our customers, nor do we believe it will have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nThe Order also modifies the methodology used for ICC traffic exchanged between carriers. As a result of implementing the provisions of the Order, our network access revenue decreased approximately $1.3 million during 2015. We anticipate that network access revenue will continue to decline as a result of the Order through 2018 by as much as $1.9 million, $4.8 million and $6.8 million in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.\nResults of Operations\nIn December 2014, the FCC released a report and order that addressed, among other things, the transition to CAF Phase II funding for price cap carriers and the acceptance criteria for CAF Phase II funding. For companies that accept the CAF Phase II funding, there is a three year transition period in instances in which their current CAF Phase I funding exceeds the CAF Phase II funding. If CAF Phase II funding exceeds CAF Phase I funding, the transitional support is waived and CAF Phase II funding begins immediately. Companies are required to commit to a statewide build out requirement to 10 Mbps downstream and 1 Mbps upstream in funded locations. We accepted the CAF Phase II funding in August 2015. The annual funding under CAF Phase I of $36.6 million will be replaced by annual funding under CAF Phase II of $13.9 million through 2020. In the state of Iowa, where CAF Phase II funding is greater than the CAF Phase I funding, the CAF Phase II funding will be received with a retroactive payment back to January 1, 2015. For all other states, funding under CAF Phase II is less than funding under CAF Phase I. The acceptance of funding at the lower level will transition over a\nNon-GAAP Measures\nas an alternative to the traditional telephone line. Depending on geographic market availability, our video services range from limited basic service to advanced digital television, which includes several plans each with hundreds of local, national and music channels including premium and pay-per-view channels as well as video on-demand service. Certain customers may also subscribe to our advanced video services, which consist of high-definition television, digital video recorders ( DVR\u201d) and/or a whole home DVR.\n\nOn June 8, 2015, we issued an additional $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (the New Notes\u201d and together with the Existing Notes, the 2022 Notes\u201d). The New Notes were priced at 98.26% of par and resulted in total gross proceeds of approximately $294.8 million, excluding accrued interest. The net proceeds from the issuance of the New Notes were used, in part, to redeem the remaining $227.2 million of the original aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes, to pay related fees and expenses and to reduce the outstanding balance of our revolving credit facility. In connection with the redemption of the 2020 Notes, we paid $261.9 million and recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $41.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAs discussed in the Regulatory Matters\u201d section below, our operating revenues are also impacted by legislative or regulatory changes at the federal and state levels, which could reduce or eliminate the current subsidies revenue we receive. A number of proceedings and recent orders relate to universal service reform, intercarrier compensation and network access charges. There are various ongoing legal challenges to the orders that have been issued. As a result, it is not yet possible to determine fully the impact of the regulatory changes on our operations.\nFinancial Data\nItem 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe cash required to fund dividend payments is in addition to our other expected cash needs, which we expect to fund with cash flows from our operations. In addition, we expect we will have sufficient availability under our revolving credit facility to fund dividend payments in addition to any expected fluctuations in working capital and other cash needs, although we do not intend to borrow under this facility to pay dividends.\nCredit Agreement Covenant Compliance\nAcquisition and other transaction costs decreased $10.4 million during 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of the acquisition of Enventis, which closed in the fourth quarter of 2014. In 2014, we incurred $11.8 million in transaction related fees in connection with the acquisition of Enventis. Transaction costs consist primarily of legal, finance and other professional fees as well as expenses related to change-in-control payments to former employees of the acquired companies.\nIn September 2011, the Texas state legislature passed Senate Bill No. 980/House Bill No. 2603 which, among other things, mandated the PUCT to review the Universal Service Fund and issue recommendations by January 1, 2013 with the intent to effectively reduce the size of the Universal Service Fund. This would be accomplished by implementing an urban floor to offset state funding reductions with a phase-in period of four years. The PUCT recommended that (i) frozen line counts\n\nLong-term Debt\nAcquisition of Enventis\n (4) Recorded obligations include amounts in accounts payable and accrued expenses for external goods and services received as of December 31, 2015 and expected to be settled in cash. \nVoice services revenue increased $10.4 million during 2015 compared to 2014 and $2.8 million during 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding the addition of Enventis revenue of $14.4 million and $3.8 million, respectively, voice services revenue decreased $4.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively, primarily due to a 5% decline in access lines during each period as commercial customers are increasingly choosing alternative technologies, including our own VoIP product, and the broad range of features that Internet based voice services can offer.\nThe estimated fair value of our single reporting unit is determined using a combination of market-based approaches and a discounted cash flow ( DCF\u201d) model. The assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are based upon a combination of historical results and trends, new industry developments, future cash flow projections, as well as relevant comparable company earnings multiples for the market-based approaches. Such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. The market-based approaches used in the valuation effort includes the publicly-traded market capitalization, guideline public companies, and guideline transaction methods. We use a weighting of the results derived from the valuation approaches to estimate the fair value of the single reporting unit. Key assumptions used in the DCF model include the following:\nThe Texas Public Utilities Regulatory Act ( PURA\u201d) directs the Public Utilities Commission of Texas ( PUCT\u201d) to adopt and enforce rules requiring local exchange carriers to contribute to a state universal service fund that helps telecommunications providers offer basic local telecommunications service at reasonable rates in high-cost rural areas. The Texas Universal Service Fund is also used to reimburse telecommunications providers for revenues lost by providing lifeline service. Our Texas rural telephone companies receive disbursements from this fund.\n \u00b7 surcharges mandated by state commissions; \nThe amounts recognized in our financial statements for pension and postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing several critical assumptions. We make significant assumptions in regards to our pension and postretirement plans, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate used to value the periodic pension expense and liabilities, future salary increases and actuarial assumptions relating to mortality rates and healthcare trend rates. Changes in these estimates and other factors could significantly impact our benefit cost and obligations to maintain pension and postretirement plans.\nConsumer\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $30.5 million during 2015 compared to 2014, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Enventis during 2014 which accounted for $31.4 million of the increase. Excluding the addition of the operations for Enventis, depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.9 million in 2015 due to certain circuit, network and terminal equipment becoming fully depreciated during 2015, which was offset in part by capital expenditures for internally developed software and outside plant related to integration and success based projects.\nState regulatory commissions generally exercise jurisdiction over carriers' facilities and services to the extent they are used to provide, originate or terminate intrastate communications. In particular, state regulatory agencies have substantial oversight over interconnection and network access by competitors of our rural telephone companies. In addition, municipalities and other local government agencies regulate the public rights-of-way necessary to install and operate networks. State regulators can sanction our rural telephone companies or revoke our certifications if we violate relevant laws or regulations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n (3) Represents compensation expenses in connection with issuance of stock awards, which because of the non-cash nature of these expenses are excluded from adjusted EBITDA. \nGoodwill\nthe lease after the expiration date. Our Board of Directors member, Richard A. Lumpkin, and his immediate family had a beneficial ownership interest of 66.7% and 72.4% in 2015 and 2014, respectively, of LATEL, directly or through Agracel, Inc. ( Agracel\u201d). Agracel is real estate investment company of which Mr. Lumpkin, together with his family, had a beneficial interest of 33.5% and 44.7% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Agracel is the sole managing member and 50% owner of LATEL. In addition, Mr. Lumpkin is a director of Agracel. The three leases require total rental payments to LATEL of approximately $7.9 million over the term of the leases. The carrying value of the capital leases at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $3.0 million and $3.4 million, respectively. We recognized $0.4 million in interest expense in 2015 and $0.5 million in interest expense in each of 2014 and 2013 and amortization expense of $0.4 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013 related to the capitalized leases.\nIn 2011, the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission ( PAPUC\u201d) issued an intrastate access reform order reducing intrastate access rates to interstate levels in a three-step process, which began in March 2012. With the release of the FCC order in November 2011, the PAPUC temporarily issued a stay. A final stay was issued in 2012 to implement the FCC ordered intrastate access rate changes. The PAPUC had indicated that it would address state universal funding in 2013, but delayed conducting a proceeding pending any state legislative activity that may occur in the 2015 legislative session. The Company will continue to monitor this matter.\nOur revenues are subject to broad federal and/or state regulation, which include such telecommunications services as local telephone service, network access service and toll service and are derived from various sources, including:\nCapital expenditures continue to be our primary recurring investing activity and were $133.9 million in 2015, an increase of $24.9 million compared to 2014. Capital expenditures for 2016 are expected to be $125.0 million to $130.0 million, of which approximately 63% is planned for success-based capital projects for consumer, commercial and carrier initiatives. Capital expenditures in 2016 and subsequent years will depend on various factors, including competition, changes in technology, regulatory changes and the timing in the deployment of new services. We expect to continue to invest in existing and new services and the expansion of our fiber network in order to retain and acquire more customers through a broader set of products and an expanded network footprint.\nSubsidies consist of both federal and state subsidies, which are designed to promote widely available, quality telephone service at affordable prices in rural areas. Subsidies revenue increased $3.1 million during 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the addition of Enventis revenue of $6.8 million, subsidies revenue decreased $3.7 million as a result of a reduction in state funding support for our Texas ILEC and the transition from CAF Phase I to CAF Phase II funding. See the Regulatory Matters\u201d section below for further discussion of the subsidies we receive.\nVoice Services\nDuring 2014, interest expense, net of interest income, decreased $3.3 million compared to 2013 primarily due to a reduction in interest expense related to our interest rate swap agreements as a result of the maturity of several agreements during 2013. Interest rates on outstanding borrowings under our Credit Agreement also declined due to the amendment of our Credit Agreement in December 2013. These reductions in interest expense were partially offset by an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of a $200.0 million Senior Note offering in September 2014 used in part to fund the acquisition of Enventis. 2014 also included additional amortization of deferred financing fees of $1.4 million related to the bridge loan facility obtained for the Enventis acquisition.\nThe following table sets forth selected information regarding our financial condition.\nGoodwill and tradenames are intangible assets that are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We evaluate the carrying value of our indefinite-lived assets, tradenames and goodwill, as of November 30 of each year.\nIn 2013, interest rate swaps previously designated as cash flow hedges were de-designated as a result of amendments to our credit agreement. These interest rate swap agreements mature on various dates through September 2016. Prior to de-designation, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ( AOCI\u201d). The balance of the unrealized loss included in AOCI as of the date the swaps were de-designated is being amortized to earnings over the remaining term of the swap agreements. Changes in fair value of the de-designated swaps are immediately recognized in earnings as interest expense. During the years ended\nSufficiency of Cash Resources\nIn 2014, cost of services and products increased $20.2 million compared to 2013. The addition of the operations for Enventis during 2014 accounted for $18.8 million of the increase. Video programming costs also increased due to a growth in video connections and an increase in costs per program channel. However, the increase in video programming costs was largely offset by a decline in employee costs due to a reduction in headcount as a result of integration and cost reduction efforts in 2013 as well as a reduction in pension expense in 2014.\nIn 2014, depreciation and amortization expense increased $10.1 million compared to 2013, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Enventis during 2014 which accounted for $8.0 million of the increase. The remaining increase was primarily associated with ongoing capital expenditures related to network enhancements and success based capital projects for consumer and commercial services.\nMr. Lumpkin also has a minority ownership interest in First Mid-Illinois Bancshares, Inc. ( First Mid-Illinois\u201d). We provide telecommunications products and services to First Mid-Illinois at standard prices as to other strategic business customers and we received approximately $0.8 million in 2015 and $0.5 million in each of 2014 and 2013 for these services.\nWe believe that our dividend policy will limit, but not preclude, our ability to grow. If we continue paying dividends at the level currently anticipated under our dividend policy, we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash, and may need to seek refinancing, to fund a material expansion of our business, including any significant acquisitions or to pursue growth opportunities requiring capital expenditures significantly beyond our current expectations. In addition, because we expect a significant portion of cash available will be distributed to holders of common stock under our dividend policy, our ability to pursue any material expansion of our business will depend more than it otherwise would on our ability to obtain third-party financing.\nIncome taxes\n (2) Includes all cash dividends and other cash distributions received from our investments. \nThe telecommunications industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation. Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, federal and state regulators share responsibility for implementing and enforcing statutes and regulations designed to encourage competition and to preserve and advance widely available, quality telephone service at affordable prices.\nAs discussed more fully in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, tradenames are generally not amortized but instead evaluated annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate potential impairment, for impairment using a preliminary qualitative assessment and two-step process, if deemed necessary. We estimate the fair value of our tradenames using DCFs based on a relief from royalty method. If the fair value of our tradenames was less than the carrying amount, we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the tradename. In accordance with Accounting Codification Standard 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other ( ASC 350\u201d) separately recorded indefinite-lived intangible assets, whether acquired or internally developed, shall be combined into a single unit of accounting for purposes of testing impairment if they are operated as a single asset and, as such, are essentially inseparable from one another. An indefinite-lived intangible asset may need to be removed from the accounting unit if it is disposed of, the accounting unit is reconsidered or one or more of the separate indefinite-lived intangible asset(s) within the accounting unit is now considered finite-lived rather than indefinite-lived. We perform our impairment testing of our tradenames as single units of accounting based on their use in our business.\nIn December 2010, we entered into new lease agreements with LATEL LLC ( LATEL\u201d) for the occupancy of three buildings on a triple net lease basis. Each of the three lease agreements have a maturity date of May 31, 2021, and have been accounted for as capital leases. Each of the three lease agreements have two five-year options to extend the terms of\nSelling, General and Administrative Costs\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows:\nCommercial and Carrier\nWe continue to focus on commercial and broadband growth opportunities and are continually expanding our commercial product offerings for both small and large businesses to capitalize on industry technological advances. We can leverage our fiber optic networks and tailor our services for business customers by developing solutions to fit their specific needs. We gained strategic advantage through the acquisition of Enventis in 2014, which recently launched a suite of cloud data services that increases efficiency and reduces IT costs for our customers. In addition, we recently launched an enhanced hosted voice product, which enables greater scalability and reliability for businesses. We anticipate future momentum in new commercial services as these new products gain traction.\nA portion of the 2020 Notes were sold to accredited investors consisting of certain members of the Company's Board of Directors or a trust of which a director is the beneficiary ( related parties\u201d). In May 2012, the related parties purchased $10.8 million of the 2020 Notes on the same terms available to other investors, except that the related parties were not entitled to registration rights. In 2015, the 2020 Notes were fully redeemed and we paid an early redemption premium of $1.5 million and recognized interest expense of approximately $0.7 million, $1.3 million and $1.2 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, in the aggregate for the 2020 Notes purchased by related parties. In September 2014, $5.0 million of the 2022 Notes were sold to a trust, the beneficiary of which is a member of the Company's Board of Directors and in 2015 we recognized approximately $0.3 million in interest expense for the 2022 Notes purchased by the related party.\nThe weighted-average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under our credit facility was 4.24% and 4.20% at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Interest is payable at least quarterly.\nCredit Agreement\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nAt our November 30, 2015 assessment date, the carrying value of goodwill was $764.6 million.\nOur recently acquired Enventis ILEC properties are cost-based rate of return companies. Historically, under FCC rules governing rate making, these ILECs were required to establish rates for their interstate telecommunications services based on projected demand usage for the various services. We projected our earnings through the use of annual cost separation studies, which utilized estimated total cost information and projected demand usage. Carriers were required to follow FCC rules in the preparation of these annual studies. We determined actual earnings from our interstate rates as actual volumes and costs became known. Effective January 1, 2015, our Enventis ILECs are treated as price cap companies for universal service purposes. In March 2015, we filed a petition for waiver to keep them as rate of return companies for switched and special access. The petition was granted in October 2015. We expect certain adjustments to take place over 24 months as a result of exiting the National Exchange Carrier Association ( NECA\u201d) pool; however, we do not anticipate that they will be material to our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.\nAs required, we contribute to qualified defined pension plans and non-qualified supplemental retirement plans (collectively the Pension Plans\u201d) and other post-retirement benefit plans, which provide retirement benefits to certain eligible employees. Contributions are intended to provide for benefits attributed to service to date. Our funding policy is to contribute annually an actuarially determined amount consistent with applicable federal income tax regulations.", "item_7_tables": "Table 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

report:\n\nOverview\n- Consolidated Communications Holdings, Inc. provides telecommunications services including data, video, voice and other services to residential and business customers.\n\nKey Developments\n- In October 2014, the company acquired Enventis Corporation for $257.7 million in stock and $139.6 million in cash. This expanded the company's network footprint and diversified its revenues.\n\n- In June 2015, the company issued $300 million in new 6.50% Senior Notes due 2022. Proceeds were used to redeem existing higher interest rate notes and pay down debt. This reduced interest expense.\n\nFinancial Results  \n- Total revenues in 2015 increased 20% over the prior year due to the acquisition and growth in commercial services and data connections. Net loss was $0.7 million compared to net income of $15.4 million in 2014, largely due to a loss on debt extinguishment. Adjusted EBITDA increased 14%.\n\nLiquidity & Capital Resources\n- Capital expenditures were $133.9 million in 2015. The company expects $125-130 million for 2016, focused on network expansion and new services. Cash flows are sufficient to fund expected capital expenditures and dividends over the next 12 months.  \n\nRegulatory Developments\n- New FCC rules are redirecting universal service fund support from voice services to broadband. This is decreasing subsidies revenue but the impact is being partially offset by increased broadband connections."}
