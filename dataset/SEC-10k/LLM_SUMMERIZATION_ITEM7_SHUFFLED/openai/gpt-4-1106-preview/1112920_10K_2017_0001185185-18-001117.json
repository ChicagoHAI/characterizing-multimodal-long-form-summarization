Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and related notes included elsewhere in this document. Our consolidated financial information as of December 31, 2016, and for the year then ended, presented within this Form 10-K reflects the effects of the Restatement.\nOverview\nWe develop and sell computer software that provides secure information exchange, data transfer and sharing capabilities for enterprises and consumers. We have been in business for more than twenty years having sold our products to thousands of enterprises and more than one million individual consumers globally.\nOur primary business is selling and supporting managed file transfer, or MFT, software for enterprises. MFT software facilitates the transfer of data from one location to another across a computer network within a single enterprise or between multiple computer networks in multiple enterprises.\nOur MFT products are based upon our Enhanced File Transfer, or EFT, platform. This platform emphasizes secure and efficient data exchange for virtually any organization. It enables business partners, customers and employees to share information safely and securely. The EFT platform provides enterprise-level security while automating the integration of back-end systems which are features often missing from traditional file transfer software. The EFT platform features built-in regulatory compliance, governance, and visibility controls to maintain data safety and security. It can replace legacy systems, homegrown servers, expensive leased lines and virtual area networks, all of which can be insecure, with a top-performing, scalable alternative. The EFT platform promotes ease of administration while providing the detailed capabilities necessary for complete control of a file transfer system.\nWe earn most of our revenue from the sale of products and services that are part of our EFT platform. Our customers can purchase the capabilities of our EFT platform in two ways:\nTable 194: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Under a perpetual software license for which they pay a one-time fee and under which they typically install our product on computers that they own and/or manage. Our brand name for this product is EFT. Almost all customers who purchase EFT also purchase a maintenance and support, or M&S, contract for which they pay us a recurring fee. Most of the revenue we have earned from our EFT platform products has been from sales of perpetual software licenses and related M&S.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> As a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, under which they pay us ongoing fees to access the capabilities of the EFT platform in the cloud. Through the end of 2017, EFT Cloud was our SaaS offering of the EFT platform which users accessed for a flat monthly subscription fee. In January 2018, we introduced EFT Arcus, which will be our SaaS offering of the EFT platform going forward, for which users will pay a base monthly subscription fee plus an additional variable amount determined based upon their metered usage of EFT Arcus resources.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe sell other products that are synergistic to our EFT platform including Mail Express, WAFS, and CuteFTP. Collectively, these products constituted less than 5% of our total revenue in 2017. Customers pay a one-time fee to purchase these products under a perpetual software license. Some customers also purchase an M&S contract. We do not offer a SaaS version of these products and have no plans to do so.\nWe also earn revenue from professional services we provide to assist our customers in configuring and integrating our EFT platform products into their environments.\nWe focus on selling our EFT platform products in a business-to-business environment. The majority of the resources we will expend in the future for product research, development, marketing and sales will focus on EFT platform products. We expect to expend minimal resources developing and selling our other products. We believe our EFT platform products and business capabilities are well-positioned to compete effectively in the market for these products.\nIn June 2017, we introduced a data integration product that we planned to sell under the brand name Kenetix. We licensed the technology for this product from a third-party. We have experienced issues with the third-party technology and have determined to suspend marketing of the product as we evaluate options and determine whether the licensor can effectively address the issues.\nFor a more comprehensive discussion of the products we sell and the services we offer, see Software Products and Services above.\nKey Business Metrics\nKey Business Metrics\nWe review a number of key business metrics on an ongoing basis to help us monitor our performance and to identify material trends which may affect our business. The significant metrics we review are described below.\nRevenue Growth\nWe believe annual revenue growth is a key metric for monitoring our continued success in developing our business in future periods. Given our diverse solution portfolio, we regularly review our revenue mix and changes in revenue across all solutions to identify emerging trends. We believe our revenue growth is primarily dependent upon executing our business strategies which include:\nTable 196: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Ongoing innovation of our EFT platform to address the expanding needs of our existing customers and to enhance our products' appeal to new customers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Licensing, developing and/or acquiring technologies with features and functions that are complementary to and synergistic with our EFT platform so as to expand the breadth of our product offerings.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Enhancing our sales and marketing programs to improve identification of potential demand for our products and to increase the rate at which we are successful in selling our products.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTo support product innovation, we continue to enhance our software engineering group and our focus on optimizing the manner in which we assess the development of new technologies, our approach to managing those projects, and the timelines over which we do that work.\nWe remain alert for attractive opportunities to collaborate with others or perhaps combine other revenue-producing technologies with ours to expand our product offerings and reach. To that end, we continually assess products and services offered by others that might be synergistic with our existing products. We may elect to take advantage of those opportunities through cooperative marketing agreements or licensing arrangements or by acquiring an ownership position in the enterprise offering the opportunity.\nIn continuing to develop our demand generation activities, we have made and continue to make ongoing changes in sales and marketing including:\nTable 199: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Increasing sales staff capacity as needed to address our markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Aligning our sales group to enhance its industry and geographic focus.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Implementing new sales and marketing campaigns.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Using third-party digital marketing experts with search engine optimization expertise to enhance our efforts in this area.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Evolving our lead generation programs to increase our sales staff's exposure to potential purchasers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Enhancing our support of channel partners and engaging them to sell our products through training, orientation and marketing programs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs part of growing revenue in total, we are focused on increasing license revenue both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percent of total revenue. When we sell our licensed products, we also typically create a recurring revenue stream from M&S since almost all purchasers of our licensed enterprise products also purchase an M&S contract. Most of our M&S contracts are for one year although we also sell multi-year contracts. The customer pays us the M&S fee for the entire term of the agreement at the time the contract begins. We recognize that amount as revenue ratably in future periods over the term of the contract.\nWe typically experience a high renewal rate for M&S services for our enterprise products so long as a customer continues using the licensed product they purchased from us. As a result, growing license revenue not only contributes to increasing revenue growth at the time the license is sold but also provides a foundation for future recurring revenue as the purchasers of our licensed products renew M&S contracts to support their ongoing product support needs. This pattern of activity can create a cumulative effect for M&S renewals as a result of the cumulative number of licensed software installations sold over multiple years that create M&S renewals in any single year predictably (and in line with our expectations) exceeding the number of new software licenses we sell in a single year. We expect this cumulative effect to continue to grow if we continue to increase enterprise software license revenue in future periods. For these reasons, we expect M&S revenue will remain a substantial part of our total revenue.\nSee Comparison of the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 for a discussion of trends in our revenue growth that we monitor using this metric.\nIn the past, we reported bookings and potential future revenue as key business metrics. With the refinement of our revenue growth key business metric discussed above, we no longer rely on bookings or potential future revenue as key business metrics since we have determined that our revenue growth metric is the primary metric upon which we rely to measure the success of sales and marketing programs and our outlook for revenue in the future.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP Measurement)\nWe utilize Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Total Other Income/Expense, Depreciation, Amortization, other than amortization of capitalized software development costs, and Share-Based Compensation Expense) to provide us a view of income and expenses that is supplemental and secondary to our primary assessment of net income as presented in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. We use Adjusted EBITDA to provide another perspective for measuring profitability from our core operating activities that does not include the effects of the following items:\nTable 205: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Expenses that typically do not require us to pay them in cash in the current period (such as depreciation, amortization and share-based compensation);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> The cost of financing our business; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 207: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> The effects of income taxes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe monitor Adjusted EBITDA to assess our performance relative to our intended strategies, expected patterns of action, and budgets. We use the results of that assessment to adjust our future activities to the extent we deem necessary.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. It should not be considered as a substitute for net income presented on our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and when assessing our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or without a simultaneous reading and consideration of our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nWe compute Adjusted EBITDA as follows ($ in thousands):\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td>

<table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Professional services revenue from a variety of implementation and integration services, as well as delivery of education and training associated with our solutions, which we recognize as the services are completed.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe earn most of our revenue from the sale of our EFT platform products and the associated M&S and professional services related to those products. With our core competency being in products that address the MFT market, we believe our EFT platform products provide the best opportunity for our future growth. Accordingly, expansion of the capabilities of the EFT platform will be our primary focus in the future. While we will continue to sell and support our other products for the foreseeable future, they will not be an area of emphasis for us going forward.\nWe believe that continuing to offer licensed products installed on-premises for which we recognize revenue up-front and that carry with them a recurring M&S revenue stream continues to be important to our future success. At the same time, we recognize that a migration of capabilities to a SaaS platform is attractive to a growing number of customers. We have, and have had for quite some time, the capabilities in place to deliver our EFT platform in that manner. In 2018, we released EFT Arcus as our newest offering of the EFT platform as SaaS.\nA migration in the marketplace from purchasing our EFT platform products for a one-time, perpetual license fee, along with an associated contract for M&S services, to paying a monthly fee to access those products in a SaaS manner, could cause our revenue growth rate to decrease and could cause a short-term decline in our revenue. These decreases could occur because it can typically takes approximately 24 to 36 months for the cumulative revenue earned from delivering our EFT platform products for a monthly subscription fee to exceed the cumulative revenue we would earn from the combination of selling a perpetual license for a one-time fee along with an M&S contract.\nIn mid-2016, we reviewed the allocation of our product research, development, sales and marketing resources across all of our products. As a result of that review, we decided to adjust that allocation to focus most of our resources involved in product research and development, as well as our sales and marketing activities, on our EFT platform products in order to expand their capabilities and to remain positioned to be responsive to the evolving needs of our customers. Accordingly, we do not expect to expend significant resources in the future on expanding the features and capabilities of, or on sales and marketing programs for, Mail Express, WAFS and CuteFTP. We plan to continue providing customer support for those products for the foreseeable future.\nTo support product innovation, we continue to enhance our software engineering group and our focus on optimizing the manner in which we assess the development of new technologies, our approach to managing those projects, and the timelines over which we do that work. In continuing to develop our demand generation, marketing and sales activities, we have made and continue to make ongoing changes in sales and marketing including:\nTable 214: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Increasing sales staffing and capabilities as needed to address our markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 215: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Aligning our sales group to enhance its industry and geographic focus.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Implementing new sales and marketing campaigns.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Evolving our lead generation programs to increase our sales staff's exposure to potential purchasers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Enhancing our support of channel partners and engaging them to sell our products through training, orientation and marketing programs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur total revenue increased 4% in 2017.

Our long term investments as of that date consisted of a certificate of deposit maturing in December 2021.\nWhen assessing our liquidity and capital resources, we consider the following factors:\nTable 220: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> We may access and monetize our certificates of deposit at any time without risk of loss of the original amounts invested. If we were to redeem these certificates of deposit prior to their maturity, we may incur a penalty and forfeit certain amounts of accrued interest.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Deferred revenue, unlike the other liability components of our working capital, is an obligation we will satisfy by providing services in the future to our customers as part of our ongoing operating activities from which we have historically generated cash flow. Our deferred revenue does not involve a disbursement of cash as a direct payment of that liability although we will incur operating expenses in the future as we deliver those M&S services.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur capital requirements principally relate to our need to fund our ongoing operating expenditures, which are primarily related to employee salaries and benefits. We make these expenditures to enhance our existing products, develop new products, sell those products in the marketplace and support our customers after the sale.\nWe rely on cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flows from operations to fund our operating activities and believe those items will be our principal sources of capital for the foreseeable future. If our revenue declines and/or our expenses increase, our cash flow from operations and cash on hand could decline.\nWe plan to expend significant resources in the future for research and development of our products and expansion and enhancement of our sales and marketing activities. If sales decline or if our liquidity is otherwise under duress, we could substantially reduce personnel and personnel-related costs, reduce or substantially eliminate capital expenditures and/or reduce or substantially eliminate certain research and development and sales and marketing expenditures. We may also sell equity or debt securities or enter into credit arrangements in order to finance future acquisitions or licensing activities, to the extent available.\nCash provided or used by our various activities consisted of the following ($ in thousands):\nTable 222: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Cash Provided (Used) During the\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,736\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,065\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,212\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (13,880\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (836\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (175\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur cash provided by operating activities decreased during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the following factors set forth on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Net income after considering adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities decreasing from $6.7 million in 2016 to $5.5 million in 2017.

Deferred revenue, unlike the other liability components of our working capital, is an obligation we will satisfy through providing services in the future to our customers as part of our ongoing operating activities from which we have historically generated cash flow. Our deferred revenue does not involve a disbursement of cash as a direct payment of that liability.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 229: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> An obligation under a contract with a third party to make future minimum prepaid royalty payments in the amount of $800,000 in September 2018 and $1.2 million in November 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 230: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities which include our contractual obligations to pay software royalties to third parties that vary in amount based on our sales volume of products upon which royalties are payable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Operating lease for our office space.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Federal and state taxes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur non-cancellable, contractual obligations at December 31, 2017, consisted of the following (in thousands):\nTable 233: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amounts Due for the Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fiscal Years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Prepaid royalty fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,200\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,160\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,320\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,480\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, has issued the following Accounting Standard Updates (ASU) described below that we believe may be relevant to our business and to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nASU 2017-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting (issued September 2017) - This update provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting. It states that in these situations, modification accounting should be applied unless the fair value of the modified award is the same as the fair value of the original award immediately before the original award was modified, the vesting conditions of the modified award are the same as the vesting conditions of the original award immediately before the original award was modified, and the classification of the modified award as equity or a liability is the same as the classification of the original award immediately before the original award was modified. This update is effective for all entities for annual periods including interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (issued January 2017) - To simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill, Step 2 was eliminated from the goodwill impairment test. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, an entity was required to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities) following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Instead, under the amendments in this update, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. Any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. This update also eliminated the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and, if it fails that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. Therefore, the same impairment assessment applies to all reporting units. An entity is required to disclose the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount of net assets. An entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. A public business entity that is a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filer is required to adopt the amendments in this update for its annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We expect that the application of the provisions of this update will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows - Restricted Cash (issued November 2016) - This pronouncement addresses the diversity of practice that exists in the classification and presentation of transfers between cash and restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. It provides that restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flow. Since we do not have any restricted cash balances, we do not expect this pronouncement to have a material effect on how we present items in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (issued June 2016) - This pronouncement provides guidance as to the treatment of transactions in a statement of cash flows with respect to eight specific cash flow issues. During 2017 and 2016, we had no transactions of the type cited in the statement and do not anticipate having any such transactions in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, we do not expect this pronouncement to have a material effect on how we present items in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (issued June 2016) - Among the provisions of this ASU is a requirement that assets measured at amortized cost, which includes trade accounts receivable, be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. This pronouncement requires that an entity reflect all of its expected credit losses based on current estimates which will replace the current standard requiring that an entity need consider only past events and current conditions in measuring an incurred loss. We are subject to this guidance effective with consolidated financial statements we issue for the year ending December 31, 2020, and the quarterly periods during that year. We do not expect the amounts we report as accounts receivable in those future periods under this guidance to be materially affected relative to current guidance.\nASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (issued March 2016) - When implemented, this standard will discontinue the recording in equity of tax benefits or tax deficiencies that arise from differences between share-based payment compensation expense recorded for financial statement purposes and that expense deductible for tax purposes. This new standard requires that the tax effect of all such differences be recorded and reported in the statement of operations. This standard also requires that tax-related cash flows resulting from share-based payments be reported as operating activities in the statement of cash flows which is a change from the current requirement to present such tax-related items as an inflow from financing activities and an outflow from operating activities. As prescribed by this standard, we adopted it beginning January 1, 2017, and followed it in the preparation of our financial statements as of December 31, 2017.\nThis standard also permits an accounting policy election for the impact of forfeitures on the recognition of expense for share-based payment awards. Forfeitures may be either estimated (as has been the requirement in the past) or recognized when they occur. We elected to continue estimating forfeitures consistent with our existing practices thereby resulting in no change to our application of GAAP for this aspect of computing share-based compensation.\nASU 2016-02, Leases (issued February 2016). The main difference between existing GAAP and this ASU 2016-02 is the presentation by lessees on their financial statements of lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases. Since this new standard retains the distinction between finance and operating leases, the effect of leases in the statement of operations and the statement of cash flows will be largely unchanged from existing GAAP. Our only lease of significance is our operating lease for our corporate office space for which we will present a right-to-use asset and a lease liability on our balance sheet when we implement this standard. We are in the process of determining those amounts. In accordance with this standard, we will implement it beginning with our interim and annual financial statements for 2019. The extent of the effect of this standard on our consolidated financial statements for 2019 and later will depend upon the leases, if any, that we have in effect at that date.\nASU 2015-17, Income Tax: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (issued November 2015) - This pronouncement requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities for a tax jurisdiction, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. We have implemented this ASU in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (issued May 2014) - The core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We will implement these new principles effective with consolidated financial statements we issue for the year ending December 31, 2018, and the quarterly periods during that year.\nWe have assessed the effect of ASU 2014-09 on the amount and timing of revenue we expect to recognize from our business activities in 2018 and later. We do not expect there to be material differences in the amount and timing of revenue we recognize from similar business activities in future periods determined by applying ASU 2014-09 as compared to revenue we would have otherwise recognized by applying GAAP as it existed prior to 2018.\nWe have determined that the application of ASU 2014-09 will have a material effect on the timing of our recording of expenses resulting from the incremental costs we incur to obtain a contract with a customer to deliver goods and services. These incremental costs consist primarily of sales commissions paid to our sales people and royalties on certain of our products paid to third parties. For years ended December 31, 2017, and earlier, we recorded the full amount of the sales commission and royalties paid on the full value of an M&S or SaaS contract as an expense on the inception date of the M&S contract. Under ASU 2014-09, we will account for such costs we incur in 2018 and later as follows:\nTable 234: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> If these costs are associated with products and services for which we recognize revenue at a point in time (primarily sales of perpetual software licenses and professional services), we will expense these costs in full at the time we recognize that revenue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 235: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> If these costs are associated with services for which we recognize revenue over time (primarily sales of M&S and SaaS subscriptions) for which we believe it is likely that the contract for those services will be renewed for additional terms in the future, provided we deem these costs to be recoverable, we will record these costs as deferred expense asset and amortize that cost to expense as follows:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 236: <table> <tr> <td> o\n</td> <td> For the portion of the cost that we determine benefits us primarily only over the term of the specific underlying contract currently in force (such as the term of an M&S contract), we will recognize expense ratably each month over that term.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table> <tr> <td> o\n</td> <td> For the portion of the cost that we determine benefits us over an overall customer relationship that is likely to span a period of time that is longer than an initial contract term (for example, an M&S contract renewed for multiple terms in the future), we will recognize expense ratably monthly over the estimated life of the customer relationship.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur application of ASU 2014-09 to incremental costs we incur to obtain a contract with a customer will result in our recording, as an asset as of January 1, 2018, a deferred expense of approximately $1.2 million applicable to contracts with customers in effect as of that date. We previously reported this amount as an expense in our consolidated financial statements for periods ending on and before December 31, 2017. We estimate that we will amortize this amount to expense at the rate of approximately $186,000 per quarter beginning in 2018. The incremental costs we incur to obtain contracts with customers during 2018 and later years, and the amount of such costs we record as a deferred expense and amortize to expense in subsequent periods, will depend upon the nature and scope of our future business activities, the nature and mix of the products and services we sell, the compensation plans we have in place for our sales people, and the royalty arrangements we enter into with third parties.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe follow accounting standards set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. This board sets GAAP, which we follow in preparing financial statements that report our financial position, results of operations, and sources and uses of cash. We also follow the reporting regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the financial statements are published, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. It is possible the actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions and could have a material effect on the reported amounts of our financial position and results of operations.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe develop, market and sell software products and services. We recognize revenue from a transaction when the following conditions are met:\n\u00b7 Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists.\n\u00b7 Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered.\n\u00b7 The amount of the sale is fixed or determinable.\n\u00b7 Collection of the sale amount is reasonably assured.\nFor a sale transaction not meeting any one of these four criteria, we defer recognition of revenue related to that transaction until all the criteria are met.\nWe earn the majority of our software license revenue from software products sold under perpetual software license agreements. At the time our customers purchase these products, they typically also purchase an M&S contract. These transactions are multiple element software sales for which we assess the presence of vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d) of the fair value of the undelivered elements to determine the portion of these sales to recognize as revenue upon delivery of the software product and the portion of these sales to record as deferred revenue at the time the product is delivered. We amortize the deferred revenue component to revenue in future periods on a straight-line method as we deliver the related future services to the customer. For transactions, if any, for which we cannot establish VSOE of the fair value of the undelivered elements, we initially record the entire transaction as deferred revenue and amortize that amount to revenue in future periods as we deliver the related future services to the customer.\nWe provide services under M&S contracts with terms generally ranging from one to three years. We require up-front payment of our M&S fee in an amount that covers the entire term of the agreement. We record as deferred revenue amounts due or paid that relate to future periods during which we will provide the M&S service. Deferred revenue related to services we will deliver within one year is presented as a current liability while deferred revenue related to services that we will deliver more than one year into the future is presented as a non-current liability. We reduce deferred revenue and recognize revenue ratably in future periods on a straight-line method as we deliver the M&S service.\nFor our products licensed and delivered under a SaaS transaction on a monthly or other periodic subscription basis, we recognize subscription revenue, including initial setup fees, on a monthly basis ratably over the contractual term of the customer contract as we deliver our products and services. Amounts paid prior to this revenue recognition are presented as deferred revenue until earned.\nWe provide professional services to our customers consisting primarily of software installation support, operations support and training. We recognize revenue from these services as they are completed and accepted by our customers.\nWe collect sales tax on many of our sales. We do not include sales tax collected in our revenue. We record it as a liability payable to taxing authorities.\nWe will apply the principles under ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (issued May 2014), beginning with consolidated financial statements we issue in 2018. We have evaluated the implementation of these principles resulting in the following observations:\nTable 238: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> We have assessed the effect of the principles relative to our business and the manner in which we recognize revenue. We have concluded that its application will not have a material effect on the amounts or timing of revenue we report in future periods.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 239: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> We believe the application of the principles will result in a change in the manner in which we record sales commission expenses related to M&S contracts. Currently, we record the full amount of the sales commission paid on the full value of an M&S contract as an expense on the inception date of the M&S contract. After implementing ASU 2014-09, we will record that commission expense ratably over the term of the M&S contract.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 240: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> We will adopt the new principles using the modified retrospective method.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents includes all cash and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.\nShort Term Investments\nShort-term investments consist of certificates of deposit held with financial institutions with contractual maturity dates less than one year from the balance sheet date. The Company has the intent and ability to hold these investments until their maturity dates and therefore accounts for them as held-to-maturity. These certificates of deposit are stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair value of these investments.\nLong-Term Investments\nLong-term investments consist of certificates of deposit held with financial institutions with contractual maturity dates greater than one year from the balance sheet date. The Company has the intent and ability to hold these investments until their maturity dates and therefore accounts for them as held-to-maturity. These certificates of deposit are stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair value of these investments.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is comprised of furniture and fixtures, software, computer equipment and leasehold improvements which are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Furniture, fixtures and equipment have a useful life of five to seven years, computer equipment and software have a useful life of three years and leasehold improvements have a useful life that is the shorter of the term of the lease under which the improvements were made or the estimated useful life of the asset.\nExpenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized. On at least an annual basis, we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level using December 31 as the measurement date. We operate as a single reporting unit.\nWhen testing goodwill, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. In performing this qualitative assessment, we assess events and circumstances relevant to us including, but not limited to:\nTable 241: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Macroeconomic conditions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 242: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Industry and market considerations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 243: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Cost factors and trends for labor and other expenses of operating our business.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 244: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Our overall financial performance and outlook for the future.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 245: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Trends in the quoted market value and trading of our common stock.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn considering these and other factors, we consider the extent to which any adverse events and circumstances identified could affect the comparison of our reporting unit's fair value with its carrying amount. We place more weight on events and circumstances that most affect our reporting unit's fair value or the carrying amount of our net assets. We consider positive and mitigating events and circumstances that may affect our determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. We evaluate, on the basis of the weight of the evidence, the significance of all identified events and circumstances in the context of determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.\nIf, after assessing the totality of these qualitative events and circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we conclude there is no impairment of goodwill and perform no further testing in accordance with GAAP. If we conclude otherwise, we proceed with performing the first step, and if necessary, the second step, of the two-step goodwill impairment test prescribed by GAAP.\nAs of December 31, 2017, after assessing the totality of the relevant events and circumstances, we determined it not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. Accordingly, we concluded there was no impairment of goodwill as of that date. There have been no material events or changes in circumstances since that time indicating that the carrying amount of goodwill may exceed its fair market value and that interim testing needed to be performed.\nCapitalized Software Development Costs\nWhen we complete research and development for a software product and have in place a program plan and a detail program design or a working model of that software product, we capitalize production costs incurred for that software product from that point forward until it is ready for general release to the public. Thereafter, we amortize capitalized software production costs to expense using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of that product, which is generally three years. We periodically assess the carrying value of capitalized software development costs and our method of amortizing them relative to our estimates of realizability through sales of products in the marketplace.\nCost of revenue\nCost of revenue consists of expenses associated with the production, delivery and support of the products and services we sell. Cost of license revenue consists primarily of amortization of the capitalized software development costs we incur when producing our software products, royalties we pay to use software developed by others for certain features of our products, and fees we pay to third parties who provide services supporting our SaaS solutions. Cost of M&S revenue and cost of professional services revenue consist primarily of salaries and related costs of our employees and third parties we use to deliver these services.\nResearch and Development\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred.\nAdvertising Expense\nWe expense advertising costs as incurred as a component of our sales and marketing expenses.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe measure the cost of share-based payment transactions at the grant date based on the calculated fair value of the award. We recognize this cost as an expense ratably over the recipient's requisite service period during which that award vests or becomes unrestricted.\nFor stock option awards, we estimate their fair value at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model considering the following factors:\nTable 246: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We estimate expected volatility based on historical volatility of our common stock.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 247: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We use primarily the simplified method to derive an expected term which represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding. We use this method because our options are plain-vanilla options, and we believe our historical option exercise experience is not adequately indicative of our future expectations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 248: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We base the risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 249: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We estimate a dividend yield based on our historical and expected future dividend payments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor restricted stock awards, we use the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date as the fair value of the award.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes, as measured by the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are carried on the balance sheet with the presumption that they will be realizable in future periods in which we generate taxable income.\nWe assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income. Based on this assessment, we provide any necessary valuation allowance on our balance sheet with a corresponding increase in the tax provision on our statement of operations. Any valuation allowances we establish are determined based upon a number of assumptions, judgments, and estimates, including forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic jurisdictions in which we operate.\nWe account for uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, we evaluate the tax position to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained, we assess the tax position to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The amount of the benefit we recognize is the largest amount that we believe has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions for which reserves have been established.\nWe record the effect of new tax legislation in the period in which it is signed into law.\nEarnings Per Share\nWe compute basic earnings per share using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the periods. We compute diluted earnings per share using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding.\nAwards of non-vested options are considered potentially dilutive common shares for the purpose of computing earnings per common share. We apply the treasury stock method to non-vested options under which the assumed proceeds include the amount the employee must pay to exercise the option plus the amount of unrecognized cost attributable to future periods less any expected tax benefits.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nTable 250: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,891\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,595\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,296\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,213\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,292\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (79\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 27,678\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 26,303\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,375\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,862\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 11,558\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,304\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,066\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,947\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,119\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,128\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,571\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25,056\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 21,076\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,980\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,622\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,227\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2,605\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,547\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,801\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (254\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,371\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,585\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,214\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the discussions below, we refer to the year ended December 31, 2017 as 2017\u201d and the year ended December 31, 2016, as 2016\u201d.

Revenue from our EFT platform products and services increased 6.5%. That increase was offset by a 30.3% decrease in revenue from our other products consisting of Mail Express, WAFS, CuteFTP, and TappIn. The portion of our total revenue realized from those other products decreased to 4.6%.\nThese trends are in line with our expectations as a result of our strategy implemented in mid-2016 to focus our efforts primarily on our EFT platform products. At the same time, we decided that while we would continue selling our other products, we would de-emphasize them in the future, not expend future significant product development and engineering resources to enhance those products, and not dedicate significant future sales and marketing activities to them. We intend to maintain our focus on our EFT platform for the foreseeable future such that we expect to see a continuing decline in revenue from our products other than those that are part of the EFT platform.\nEFT Platform Products\nLicense and M&S revenue from our EFT platform products increased 1.7%, and 13.1%, respectively. The increases across these products and services were primarily due to continued enhancement in our product development and software engineering groups which allowed us to refine our process for identifying new product opportunities, to better focus our resources on products that would yield larger and more immediate revenue opportunities, and to optimize our project management and software engineering processes to reduce the time necessary to produce new or improved products.\nSubstantially all of our EFT platform license revenue is from the sale of perpetual licenses to customers who install the software on computers they own or access in the cloud. In 2018, we released EFT Arcus, our SaaS offering of our EFT platform products, which replaced our EFT Cloud SaaS products that we sold prior to that time. Through December 31, 2017, we have not earned significant revenue from our EFT platform SaaS products. In the future, we will be placing a greater emphasis on promoting EFT Arcus to our customers. For the first 24 to 36 months that a customer subscribes to EFT Arcus, their cumulative cost of ownership will typically be less than their total cost of purchasing an EFT platform perpetual license combined with an M&S contract. Accordingly, we expect the revenue we earn during that period from an EFT Arcus customer will be less than the revenue we would earn from that same customer during that same period had they purchased a perpetual license with an M&S contract. As a result, during that period of time, we could experience a decrease in the growth rate of, or even a decline in revenue we earn from, the sale of new EFT platform perpetual licenses. We could also experience a decrease in the growth rate of our M&S revenue. However, we believe thereafter and over the long term, the cumulative, recurring revenue stream we will earn from EFT Arcus will exceed what we would have otherwise earned from the sale of a perpetual licenses combined with an M&S contract.\nM&S Revenue - When we sell an EFT platform license, we also typically create a recurring revenue stream from M&S since almost all purchasers of our licensed products also purchase an M&S contract. In general, and depending upon the level of M&S a customer purchases, this recurring revenue stream is 20% to 30% per year of the price of the underlying software license to which the M&S relates.\nOur M&S contracts are typically for one year with some customers buying two or three year contracts. The customer pays us the M&S fee for the entire term of the agreement at the time the contract begins. We recognize that amount as revenue ratably in future periods over the term of the contract.\nWe typically experience a high renewal rate for M&S services for our enterprise products so long as a customer continues using the licensed product they purchased from us. As a result, the sale of an EFT platform license not only contributes to license revenue but also provides a foundation for future recurring revenue as the purchasers of our licensed products typically continue to renew M&S contracts to support their ongoing product support needs. This pattern of activity can create a cumulative effect for M&S renewals as a result of the cumulative number of licensed software installations sold over multiple years that create M&S renewals in any single year predictably (and in line with our expectations) exceeding the number of new software licenses we sell in a single year. We expect this cumulative effect to continue to grow if we continue to increase enterprise software license revenue in future periods.\nM&S revenue from our EFT platform products increased 13.1% primarily due to:\nTable 252: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> New M&S contracts resulting from ongoing sales of EFT licenses that add to the base of M&S contracts already in place.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 253: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Sustained, high renewal rates of M&S contracts by customers who initially purchased these services in earlier periods. We believe these renewals result from our programs designed to provide high-quality and responsive M&S services to our customers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2017 the U.S. Army did not renew their M&S contract used in connection with their Standard Army Maintenance System-Enhanced logistics program due to consolidation of certain of their operations. This contract provided approximately $1.9 million annually in M&S revenue.\nOur professional services revenue was $483,000 less for 2017 compared to 2016 which is a decrease of 17.9%. Going into 2016, we had a backlog of professional services engagements that arose from software sales in previous periods. We worked down that backlog during 2016 which resulted in our professional services revenue being higher than typical for 2016 relative to software license revenue. There was not a similar backlog going into 2017 such that our professional services revenue for 2017 decreased as compared to 2016 but was at a level relative to software license sales that we believe to be more typical. In addition, during 2017 we began to focus more on selling pre-packaged professional services (as compared to customized services) which, while yielding lower total revenue from professional services, allowed us to deliver professional services more efficiently and without the unpredictability that can arise with customized services.\nTo improve our ability to successfully sell existing EFT platform products and services as well as new products produced by our software engineering team, we continued to evolve our sales and marketing activities as follows:\nTable 254: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Increasing sales staffing and capabilities as needed to address our markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 255: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Aligning our sales group to enhance its industry and geographic focus.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 256: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Implementing new sales and marketing campaigns.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 257: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Evolving our lead generation programs to increase our sales staff's exposure to potential purchasers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 258: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Enhancing our support of channel partners and engaging them to sell our products through training, orientation and marketing programs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Products\nIn mid-2016, we announced that we would reduce our emphasis in the future on selling Mail Express, WAFS, CuteFTP, and TappIn products that are not part of our EFT platform. Collectively, these products constituted less than 5% and 10% of our total revenue in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Accordingly, during the second half of 2016, we began to curtail our product development and engineering resources for these products and significantly reduced our sales and marketing activities supporting them. As a result, our license and M&S revenue from those products collectively declined 30.3% in 2017 compared to 2016. Our future focus will continue to be on our EFT platform such that we expect to see a continuing decline in revenue from these other products although we do expect them to continue to produce a modest contribution margin that contributes to our future profitability.\nCost of Revenues. These expenses are associated with the production, delivery and support of our products and services. We believe it is most meaningful to view cost of revenues as a percent of the revenues to which those costs relate since many of those costs are variable relative to revenue.\nCost of license revenue consists primarily of:\nTable 259: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Amortization of capitalized software development costs we incur when producing our software products. This amortization begins when a product is ready for general release to the public and generally is an expense that is not directly variable relative to revenue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 260: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Royalties we pay to use software developed by others for certain features of our products that is generally an expense that is variable relative to revenue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 261: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Fees we pay to third parties who provide services supporting our SaaS subscription solutions for our EFT platform that generally have components that are both variable and not variable relative to revenue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of M&S revenue and cost of professional services revenue consist primarily of salaries and related costs of our employees and third parties we use to deliver these services.\nCost of software license revenue decreased 2.8% and as a percent of software license revenue was 27.3% in both 2017 and 2016. These minor fluctuations are primarily caused by the mix of products sold that are associated with a royalty and are well within our expectations.\nCost of M&S revenue as a percent of M&S revenue was substantially unchanged. Cost of revenue for M&S in absolute dollars increased by 14.7% due to an increase in M&S revenue. The cost of delivering M&S can vary slightly up or down from period-to-period, but we believe such changes are typically not indicative of long term trends or permanent changes in our cost of delivering M&S. Our gross margin on these services generally remains greater than 90% as a result of a consistent application of our customer support delivery protocols and practices.\nCost of professional services revenue as a percent of that revenue was 66.5% in 2017 as compared to 62.7% in 2016. This variation resulted from the varying scope and mix of the professional services we deliver that can change from period-to-period in response to the circumstances of the customer environments in which we are working. Because the cost of revenue for professional services is highly variable relative to our revenue from our services, this cost in absolute dollars decreased 13.1% due to a decrease in our professional services revenue for the reasons discussed above.\nSales and Marketing. We believe it meaningful to view cost of sales and marketing as a percent of revenues since many of those costs, particularly sales commissions, are variable relative to revenue. These expenses were 38.0% of total revenue for 2017 compared to 35.6% of total revenue for 2016. In absolute dollars these expenses increased 11.3%. These variations were primarily due to:\nTable 262: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Increasing the size of our sales, marketing and product strategy teams and increased compensation rates due to competitive demands in the marketplace.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 263: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Increased marketing activities related to competitive intelligence and channel development.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 264: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Increased sales lead generation activities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and Development. The overall profile of our research and development activities was as follows ($ in thousands):\nTable 265: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ending December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> R&D expenditures expensed\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,128\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,571\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> R&D expenditures capitalized\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,926\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,538\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total R&D expenditures (non-GAAP measurement)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,054\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,109\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur R&D expenditures expensed increased 21.7% and our R&D expenditures capitalized increased 25.2%. These results were due to our planned, continued increase in our capacity to develop new products as well as maintain our existing products and research technologies available from third-parties. We did this through a combination of increasing our engineering headcount and engaging additional third-party resources on a flexible basis as needed. In particular, we expended additional resources developing our Workspaces, Remote Agent and Cloud Connector EFT platform modules released in 2017 and our EFT Arcus product that we introduced in January 2018.\nTotal resources expended for R&D set forth above as total R&D expenditures serves to illustrate our total corporate efforts to improve our existing products and to develop new products regardless of whether or not our expenditures for those efforts were expensed or capitalized. Total resources expended for R&D is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for R&D expense (set forth above as R&D expenditures expensed) and capitalized software development costs (set forth above as R&D expenditures capitalized) individually. While we believe the non-GAAP, total resources expended for R&D amount provides useful supplemental information regarding our overall corporate product improvement and new product creation activities, there are limitations associated with the use of this non-GAAP measurement. Total resources expended for R&D is a non-GAAP measure not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies since there is no standard for preparing this non-GAAP measure. As a result, this non-GAAP measure of total resources expended for R&D has limitations and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, R&D expense and capitalized software development cost individually.\nGeneral and Administrative. These expenses increased 30.5% primarily due to:\nTable 266: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Increased professional fees and related expenses totaling $2.5 million associated with the Investigation, the Restatement and related litigation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 267: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> An increase in professional fees paid to third-party advisors and our registered independent public accountants related to the independent audit of our internal controls in 2017 that was required for the first time due to us becoming an accelerated filer under SEC regulations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 268: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> An increase in share-based compensation expense due to a higher average number of options outstanding in 2017 compared to 2016.

Other income consists primarily of interest income earned on certificates of deposit.

Total resources expended for R&D is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for R&D expense (set forth above as R&D expenditures expensed) and capitalized software development costs (set forth above as R&D expenditures capitalized) individually. While we believe the non-GAAP, total resources expended for R&D amount provides useful supplemental information regarding our overall corporate product improvement and new product creation activities, there are limitations associated with the use of this non-GAAP measurement. Total resources expended for R&D is a non-GAAP measure not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies since there is no standard for preparing this non-GAAP measure. As a result, this non-GAAP measure of total resources expended for R&D has limitations and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, R&D expense and capitalized software development cost individually.\nRevenue Recognition\n \u00b7 Aligning our sales group to enhance its industry and geographic focus. \nWe account for uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, we evaluate the tax position to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained, we assess the tax position to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The amount of the benefit we recognize is the largest amount that we believe has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions for which reserves have been established.\n \u2022 We estimate a dividend yield based on our historical and expected future dividend payments. \nTable 265: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ending December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> R&D expenditures expensed\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,128\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,571\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> R&D expenditures capitalized\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,926\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,538\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total R&D expenditures (non-GAAP measurement)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,054\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,109\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u00b7 Deferred revenue decreasing $395,000 during 2017 compared to increasing $1.2 million during 2016.

This platform emphasizes secure and efficient data exchange for virtually any organization. It enables business partners, customers and employees to share information safely and securely. The EFT platform provides enterprise-level security while automating the integration of back-end systems which are features often missing from traditional file transfer software. The EFT platform features built-in regulatory compliance, governance, and visibility controls to maintain data safety and security. It can replace legacy systems, homegrown servers, expensive leased lines and virtual area networks, all of which can be insecure, with a top-performing, scalable alternative.

With the refinement of our revenue growth key business metric discussed above, we no longer rely on bookings or potential future revenue as key business metrics since we have determined that our revenue growth metric is the primary metric upon which we rely to measure the success of sales and marketing programs and our outlook for revenue in the future.\nSubstantially all of our EFT platform license revenue is from the sale of perpetual licenses to customers who install the software on computers they own or access in the cloud. In 2018, we released EFT Arcus, our SaaS offering of our EFT platform products, which replaced our EFT Cloud SaaS products that we sold prior to that time. Through December 31, 2017, we have not earned significant revenue from our EFT platform SaaS products. In the future, we will be placing a greater emphasis on promoting EFT Arcus to our customers. For the first 24 to 36 months that a customer subscribes to EFT Arcus, their cumulative cost of ownership will typically be less than their total cost of purchasing an EFT platform perpetual license combined with an M&S contract. Accordingly, we expect the revenue we earn during that period from an EFT Arcus customer will be less than the revenue we would earn from that same customer during that same period had they purchased a perpetual license with an M&S contract. As a result, during that period of time, we could experience a decrease in the growth rate of, or even a decline in revenue we earn from, the sale of new EFT platform perpetual licenses. We could also experience a decrease in the growth rate of our M&S revenue. However, we believe thereafter and over the long term, the cumulative, recurring revenue stream we will earn from EFT Arcus will exceed what we would have otherwise earned from the sale of a perpetual licenses combined with an M&S contract.\nLicense and M&S revenue from our EFT platform products increased 1.7%, and 13.1%, respectively. The increases across these products and services were primarily due to continued enhancement in our product development and software engineering groups which allowed us to refine our process for identifying new product opportunities, to better focus our resources on products that would yield larger and more immediate revenue opportunities, and to optimize our project management and software engineering processes to reduce the time necessary to produce new or improved products.\nTable 251: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Revenue for the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td>

services in earlier periods. We believe these renewals result from our programs designed to provide high-quality and responsive M&S services to our customers. \n \u00b7 Increased marketing activities related to competitive intelligence and channel development. \n \u00b7 Certain expenses in our consolidated financial statements, such as a portion of meals and entertainment expenses, that are not deductible on our federal income tax return. \n o For the portion of the cost that we determine benefits us over an overall customer relationship that is likely to span a period of time that is longer than an initial contract term (for example, an M&S contract renewed for multiple terms in the future), we will recognize expense ratably monthly over the estimated life of the customer relationship. \nIn June 2017, we introduced a data integration product that we planned to sell under the brand name Kenetix. We licensed the technology for this product from a third-party. We have experienced issues with the third-party technology and have determined to suspend marketing of the product as we evaluate options and determine whether the licensor can effectively address the issues.\n \u00b7 State income taxes included in income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements. \n \u00b7 If these costs are associated with products and services for which we recognize revenue at a point in time (primarily sales of perpetual software licenses and professional services), we will expense these costs in full at the time we recognize that revenue. \nFor a more comprehensive discussion of the products we sell and the services we offer, see Software Products and Services above.\nWe measure the cost of share-based payment transactions at the grant date based on the calculated fair value of the award. We recognize this cost as an expense ratably over the recipient's requisite service period during which that award vests or becomes unrestricted.\n \u00b7 We may access and monetize our certificates of deposit at any time without risk of loss of the original amounts invested. If we were to redeem these certificates of deposit prior to their maturity, we may incur a penalty and forfeit certain amounts of accrued interest. \nSee Comparison of the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 for a discussion of trends in our revenue growth that we monitor using this metric.\nA migration in the marketplace from purchasing our EFT platform products for a one-time, perpetual license fee, along with an associated contract for M&S services, to paying a monthly fee to access those products in a SaaS manner, could cause our revenue growth rate to decrease and could cause a short-term decline in our revenue. These decreases could occur because it can typically takes approximately 24 to 36 months for the cumulative revenue earned from delivering our EFT platform products for a monthly subscription fee to exceed the cumulative revenue we would earn from the combination of selling a perpetual license for a one-time fee along with an M&S contract.\nOur non-cancellable, contractual obligations at December 31, 2017, consisted of the following (in thousands):\nThe amount of cash we used for investing activities during 2017 decreased compared to 2016 due primarily to the purchase of certificates of deposit in 2016 for which there was no similar event in 2017.\nCost of professional services revenue as a percent of that revenue was 66.5% in 2017 as compared to 62.7% in 2016. This variation resulted from the varying scope and mix of the professional services we deliver that can change from period-to-period in response to the circumstances of the customer environments in which we are working. Because the cost of revenue for professional services is highly variable relative to our revenue from our services, this cost in absolute dollars decreased 13.1% due to a decrease in our professional services revenue for the reasons discussed above.\nASU 2017-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting (issued September 2017) - This update provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting. It states that in these situations, modification accounting should be applied unless the fair value of the modified award is the same as the fair value of the original award immediately before the original award was modified, the vesting conditions of the modified award are the same as the vesting conditions of the original award immediately before the original award was modified, and the classification of the modified award as equity or a liability is the same as the classification of the original award immediately before the original award was modified. This update is effective for all entities for annual periods including interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nASU 2015-17, Income Tax: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (issued November 2015) - This pronouncement requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities for a tax jurisdiction, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. We have implemented this ASU in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nOffset by:\nOffset by:\nCritical Accounting Policies\n \u00b7 The effects of income taxes. \nTo improve our ability to successfully sell existing EFT platform products and services as well as new products produced by our software engineering team, we continued to evolve our sales and marketing activities as follows:\nKey Business Metrics\nAdvertising Expense\n\u00b7 Collection of the sale amount is reasonably assured.\n \u00b7 Deferred revenue, unlike the other liability components of our working capital, is an obligation we will satisfy by providing services in the future to our customers as part of our ongoing operating activities from which we have historically generated cash flow. Our deferred revenue does not involve a disbursement of cash as a direct payment of that liability although we will incur operating expenses in the future as we deliver those M&S services. \nTo support product innovation, we continue to enhance our software engineering group and our focus on optimizing the manner in which we assess the development of new technologies, our approach to managing those projects, and the timelines over which we do that work. In continuing to develop our demand generation, marketing and sales activities, we have made and continue to make ongoing changes in sales and marketing including:\nIn the discussions below, we refer to the year ended December 31, 2017 as 2017\u201d and the year ended December 31, 2016, as 2016\u201d. The percentage changes cited in our discussions below are the change between 2017 and 2016.\nWe rely on cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flows from operations to fund our operating activities and believe those items will be our principal sources of capital for the foreseeable future. If our revenue declines and/or our expenses increase, our cash flow from operations and cash on hand could decline.\nWe compute basic earnings per share using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the periods. We compute diluted earnings per share using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding.\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n \u00b7 Accounts payable increasing $970,000 in 2017 compared to increasing $91,000 during 2016 primarily due to the abnormally high payables related to expenses from the Investigation and normal variations in the timing of payments to our vendors. \nWe earn most of our revenue from the sale of products and services that are part of our EFT platform. Our customers can purchase the capabilities of our EFT platform in two ways:\nCash and cash equivalents includes all cash and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.\nWe earn revenue primarily from the following activities:\n \u00b7 Licensing, developing and/or acquiring technologies with features and functions that are complementary to and synergistic with our EFT platform so as to expand the breadth of our product offerings. \nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe believe that continuing to offer licensed products installed on-premises for which we recognize revenue up-front and that carry with them a recurring M&S revenue stream continues to be important to our future success. At the same time, we recognize that a migration of capabilities to a SaaS platform is attractive to a growing number of customers. We have, and have had for quite some time, the capabilities in place to deliver our EFT platform in that manner. In 2018, we released EFT Arcus as our newest offering of the EFT platform as SaaS.\n \u2022 License revenue from sales of our Mail Express, WAFS and CuteFTP products that are installed at the customer's premises under a perpetual license for which we earn the full amount of the license revenue at the time the license is delivered. \n \u00b7 Increasing sales staff capacity as needed to address our markets. \nCost of license revenue consists primarily of:\nOur M&S contracts are typically for one year with some customers buying two or three year contracts. The customer pays us the M&S fee for the entire term of the agreement at the time the contract begins. We recognize that amount as revenue ratably in future periods over the term of the contract.\nIncome Taxes\n \u00b7 A decrease in bonus payments to certain of our personnel due to our financial results for 2017 not achieving the objectives necessary for them to receive bonus payments in the amounts paid in 2016. \nLong-Term Investments\n \u00b7 An obligation under a contract with a third party to make future minimum prepaid royalty payments in the amount of $800,000 in September 2018 and $1.2 million in November 2019. \nResearch and Development. The overall profile of our research and development activities was as follows ($ in thousands):\nFor a sale transaction not meeting any one of these four criteria, we defer recognition of revenue related to that transaction until all the criteria are met.\nThese trends are in line with our expectations as a result of our strategy implemented in mid-2016 to focus our efforts primarily on our EFT platform products. At the same time, we decided that while we would continue selling our other products, we would de-emphasize them in the future, not expend future significant product development and engineering resources to enhance those products, and not dedicate significant future sales and marketing activities to them. We intend to maintain our focus on our EFT platform for the foreseeable future such that we expect to see a continuing decline in revenue from our products other than those that are part of the EFT platform.\n \u2022 Industry and market considerations. \nGoodwill\n\nResearch and Development\nAwards of non-vested options are considered potentially dilutive common shares for the purpose of computing earnings per common share. We apply the treasury stock method to non-vested options under which the assumed proceeds include the amount the employee must pay to exercise the option plus the amount of unrecognized cost attributable to future periods less any expected tax benefits.\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes, as measured by the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are carried on the balance sheet with the presumption that they will be realizable in future periods in which we generate taxable income.\nWe sell other products that are synergistic to our EFT platform including Mail Express, WAFS, and CuteFTP. Collectively, these products constituted less than 5% of our total revenue in 2017. Customers pay a one-time fee to purchase these products under a perpetual software license. Some customers also purchase an M&S contract. We do not offer a SaaS version of these products and have no plans to do so.\n \u00b7 Severance pay related to the departure of the former chief executive officer in 2016 for which there was not a similar event in 2017. \nWe assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income. Based on this assessment, we provide any necessary valuation allowance on our balance sheet with a corresponding increase in the tax provision on our statement of operations. Any valuation allowances we establish are determined based upon a number of assumptions, judgments, and estimates, including forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic jurisdictions in which we operate.\n \u00b7 Net income after considering adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities decreasing from $6.7 million in 2016 to $5.5 million in 2017. The primary cause of this decrease was the expenses we incurred in connection with the Investigation. See the section below under Comparison of the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 for a discussion of additional factors that contributed to this variation. \nOur professional services revenue was $483,000 less for 2017 compared to 2016 which is a decrease of 17.9%. Going into 2016, we had a backlog of professional services engagements that arose from software sales in previous periods. We worked down that backlog during 2016 which resulted in our professional services revenue being higher than typical for 2016 relative to software license revenue. There was not a similar backlog going into 2017 such that our professional services revenue for 2017 decreased as compared to 2016 but was at a level relative to software license sales that we believe to be more typical. In addition, during 2017 we began to focus more on selling pre-packaged professional services (as compared to customized services) which, while yielding lower total revenue from professional services, allowed us to deliver professional services more efficiently and without the unpredictability that can arise with customized services.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nWe also earn revenue from professional services we provide to assist our customers in configuring and integrating our EFT platform products into their environments.\nASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (issued January 2017) - To simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill, Step 2 was eliminated from the goodwill impairment test. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, an entity was required to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities) following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Instead, under the amendments in this update, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. Any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. This update also eliminated the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and, if it fails that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. Therefore, the same impairment assessment applies to all reporting units. An entity is required to disclose the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount of net assets. An entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. A public business entity that is a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filer is required to adopt the amendments in this update for its annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We expect that the application of the provisions of this update will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe typically experience a high renewal rate for M&S services for our enterprise products so long as a customer continues using the licensed product they purchased from us. As a result, growing license revenue not only contributes to increasing revenue growth at the time the license is sold but also provides a foundation for future recurring revenue as the purchasers of our licensed products renew M&S contracts to support their ongoing product support needs. This pattern of activity can create a cumulative effect for M&S renewals as a result of the cumulative number of licensed software installations sold over multiple years that create M&S renewals in any single year predictably (and in line with our expectations) exceeding the number of new software licenses we sell in a single year. We expect this cumulative effect to continue to grow if we continue to increase enterprise software license revenue in future periods. For these reasons, we expect M&S revenue will remain a substantial part of our total revenue.\nFor our products licensed and delivered under a SaaS transaction on a monthly or other periodic subscription basis, we recognize subscription revenue, including initial setup fees, on a monthly basis ratably over the contractual term of the customer contract as we deliver our products and services. Amounts paid prior to this revenue recognition are presented as deferred revenue until earned.\nASU 2016-02, Leases (issued February 2016). The main difference between existing GAAP and this ASU 2016-02 is the presentation by lessees on their financial statements of lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases. Since this new standard retains the distinction between finance and operating leases, the effect of leases in the statement of operations and the statement of cash flows will be largely unchanged from existing GAAP. Our only lease of significance is our operating lease for our corporate office space for which we will present a right-to-use asset and a lease liability on our balance sheet when we implement this standard. We are in the process of determining those amounts. In accordance with this standard, we will implement it beginning with our interim and annual financial statements for 2019. The extent of the effect of this standard on our consolidated financial statements for 2019 and later will depend upon the leases, if any, that we have in effect at that date.\nIn mid-2016, we reviewed the allocation of our product research, development, sales and marketing resources across all of our products. As a result of that review, we decided to adjust that allocation to focus most of our resources involved in product research and development, as well as our sales and marketing activities, on our EFT platform products in order to expand their capabilities and to remain positioned to be responsive to the evolving needs of our customers. Accordingly, we do not expect to expend significant resources in the future on expanding the features and capabilities of, or on sales and marketing programs for, Mail Express, WAFS and CuteFTP. We plan to continue providing customer support for those products for the foreseeable future.\nProperty and Equipment\n \u00b7 Increasing sales staffing and capabilities as needed to address our markets. \nWe monitor Adjusted EBITDA to assess our performance relative to our intended strategies, expected patterns of action, and budgets. We use the results of that assessment to adjust our future activities to the extent we deem necessary.\nIncome Taxes. Our effective tax rate was 53.0% for 2017 and 33.4% for 2016. These rates differed from a federal statutory tax rate of 34% primarily due to:\n\n \u00b7 Increased professional fees and related expenses totaling $2.5 million associated with the Investigation, the Restatement and related litigation. \nAt December 31, 2017, our short term investments consisted of certificates of deposit maturing on various dates through 2018. Our long term investments as of that date consisted of a certificate of deposit maturing in December 2021.\n\nOur cash and working capital positions were as follows ($ in thousands):\nShare-Based Compensation\nASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (issued June 2016) - Among the provisions of this ASU is a requirement that assets measured at amortized cost, which includes trade accounts receivable, be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. This pronouncement requires that an entity reflect all of its expected credit losses based on current estimates which will replace the current standard requiring that an entity need consider only past events and current conditions in measuring an incurred loss. We are subject to this guidance effective with consolidated financial statements we issue for the year ending December 31, 2020, and the quarterly periods during that year. We do not expect the amounts we report as accounts receivable in those future periods under this guidance to be materially affected relative to current guidance.\n \u2022 Trends in the quoted market value and trading of our common stock. \nOther Income. Other income consists primarily of interest income earned on certificates of deposit. The increase in this amount was due primarily to enhanced investment of our cash beginning in the second half of 2016 to earn a higher rate of interest.\n \u00b7 Trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities which include our contractual obligations to pay software royalties to third parties that vary in amount based on our sales volume of products upon which royalties are payable. \nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and related notes included elsewhere in this document. Our consolidated financial information as of December 31, 2016, and for the year then ended, presented within this Form 10-K reflects the effects of the Restatement.\nAt December 31, 2017, our contractual obligations and commitments consisted primarily of the following items:\nWe earn the majority of our software license revenue from software products sold under perpetual software license agreements. At the time our customers purchase these products, they typically also purchase an M&S contract. These transactions are multiple element software sales for which we assess the presence of vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d) of the fair value of the undelivered elements to determine the portion of these sales to recognize as revenue upon delivery of the software product and the portion of these sales to record as deferred revenue at the time the product is delivered. We amortize the deferred revenue component to revenue in future periods on a straight-line method as we deliver the related future services to the customer. For transactions, if any, for which we cannot establish VSOE of the fair value of the undelivered elements, we initially record the entire transaction as deferred revenue and amortize that amount to revenue in future periods as we deliver the related future services to the customer.\n \u00b7 Implementing new sales and marketing campaigns. \nWe compute Adjusted EBITDA as follows ($ in thousands):\nWe remain alert for attractive opportunities to collaborate with others or perhaps combine other revenue-producing technologies with ours to expand our product offerings and reach. To that end, we continually assess products and services offered by others that might be synergistic with our existing products. We may elect to take advantage of those opportunities through cooperative marketing agreements or licensing arrangements or by acquiring an ownership position in the enterprise offering the opportunity.\nWe provide services under M&S contracts with terms generally ranging from one to three years. We require up-front payment of our M&S fee in an amount that covers the entire term of the agreement. We record as deferred revenue amounts due or paid that relate to future periods during which we will provide the M&S service. Deferred revenue related to services we will deliver within one year is presented as a current liability while deferred revenue related to services that we will deliver more than one year into the future is presented as a non-current liability. We reduce deferred revenue and recognize revenue ratably in future periods on a straight-line method as we deliver the M&S service.\nShort Term Investments\nCash and cash equivalents\nGoodwill is not amortized. On at least an annual basis, we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level using December 31 as the measurement date. We operate as a single reporting unit.\nShort-term investments consist of certificates of deposit held with financial institutions with contractual maturity dates less than one year from the balance sheet date. The Company has the intent and ability to hold these investments until their maturity dates and therefore accounts for them as held-to-maturity. These certificates of deposit are stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair value of these investments.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. It should not be considered as a substitute for net income presented on our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and when assessing our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or without a simultaneous reading and consideration of our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (issued June 2016) - This pronouncement provides guidance as to the treatment of transactions in a statement of cash flows with respect to eight specific cash flow issues. During 2017 and 2016, we had no transactions of the type cited in the statement and do not anticipate having any such transactions in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, we do not expect this pronouncement to have a material effect on how we present items in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nOur discussion of the business trends of our products is based on the following profile of our revenue components ($ in thousands):\nIf, after assessing the totality of these qualitative events and circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we conclude there is no impairment of goodwill and perform no further testing in accordance with GAAP. If we conclude otherwise, we proceed with performing the first step, and if necessary, the second step, of the two-step goodwill impairment test prescribed by GAAP.\n\nWe expense advertising costs as incurred as a component of our sales and marketing expenses.\nWe record the effect of new tax legislation in the period in which it is signed into law.\n \u2022 License revenue from sales of our EFT platform products that we deliver as either perpetually-licensed software installed at the customer's premises, for which we earn the full amount of the license revenue at the time the license is delivered, or as a cloud-based service delivered using a SaaS model, for which we earn monthly subscription revenue as these services are delivered. \nSolution Perspective and Trends\n \u00b7 Amortization of capitalized software development costs we incur when producing our software products. This amortization begins when a product is ready for general release to the public and generally is an expense that is not directly variable relative to revenue. \nProperty and equipment is comprised of furniture and fixtures, software, computer equipment and leasehold improvements which are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Furniture, fixtures and equipment have a useful life of five to seven years, computer equipment and software have a useful life of three years and leasehold improvements have a useful life that is the shorter of the term of the lease under which the improvements were made or the estimated useful life of the asset.\nWe typically experience a high renewal rate for M&S services for our enterprise products so long as a customer continues using the licensed product they purchased from us. As a result, the sale of an EFT platform license not only contributes to license revenue but also provides a foundation for future recurring revenue as the purchasers of our licensed products typically continue to renew M&S contracts to support their ongoing product support needs. This pattern of activity can create a cumulative effect for M&S renewals as a result of the cumulative number of licensed software installations sold over multiple years that create M&S renewals in any single year predictably (and in line with our expectations) exceeding the number of new software licenses we sell in a single year. We expect this cumulative effect to continue to grow if we continue to increase enterprise software license revenue in future periods.\n\n \u00b7 Increased sales lead generation activities. \n \u2022 Our overall financial performance and outlook for the future. \n \u00b7 Increasing the size of our sales, marketing and product strategy teams and increased compensation rates due to competitive demands in the marketplace. \n \u2022 Professional services revenue from a variety of implementation and integration services, as well as delivery of education and training associated with our solutions, which we recognize as the services are completed. \nWhen testing goodwill, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. In performing this qualitative assessment, we assess events and circumstances relevant to us including, but not limited to:\nCost of revenue consists of expenses associated with the production, delivery and support of the products and services we sell. Cost of license revenue consists primarily of amortization of the capitalized software development costs we incur when producing our software products, royalties we pay to use software developed by others for certain features of our products, and fees we pay to third parties who provide services supporting our SaaS solutions. Cost of M&S revenue and cost of professional services revenue consist primarily of salaries and related costs of our employees and third parties we use to deliver these services.\nOffset by:\n \u00b7 As a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, under which they pay us ongoing fees to access the capabilities of the EFT platform in the cloud. Through the end of 2017, EFT Cloud was our SaaS offering of the EFT platform which users accessed for a flat monthly subscription fee. In January 2018, we introduced EFT Arcus, which will be our SaaS offering of the EFT platform going forward, for which users will pay a base monthly subscription fee plus an additional variable amount determined based upon their metered usage of EFT Arcus resources. \nCost of revenue\n \u00b7 The domestic production activities deduction and the research and development credit that are tax credit incentives that serve to reduce the rate at which we pay federal income taxes in exchange for us conducting certain aspects of our business in a manner promoted by the Internal Revenue Code. \nResults of Operations\nWe provide professional services to our customers consisting primarily of software installation support, operations support and training. We recognize revenue from these services as they are completed and accepted by our customers.\nM&S revenue from our EFT platform products increased 13.1% primarily due to:\n \u00b7 An increase in professional fees paid to third-party advisors and our registered independent public accountants related to the independent audit of our internal controls in 2017 that was required for the first time due to us becoming an accelerated filer under SEC regulations. \n \u00b7 An increase in share-based compensation expense due to a higher average number of options outstanding in 2017 compared to 2016. Our options outstanding increased as we continued to grant options to attract and retain key personnel in a competitive marketplace for talent. \n\u00b7 Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered.\nGeneral and Administrative. These expenses increased 30.5% primarily due to:\nWhen assessing our liquidity and capital resources, we consider the following factors:\nAt the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2017 the U.S. Army did not renew their M&S contract used in connection with their Standard Army Maintenance System-Enhanced logistics program due to consolidation of certain of their operations. This contract provided approximately $1.9 million annually in M&S revenue.\nWe earn most of our revenue from the sale of our EFT platform products and the associated M&S and professional services related to those products. With our core competency being in products that address the MFT market, we believe our EFT platform products provide the best opportunity for our future growth. Accordingly, expansion of the capabilities of the EFT platform will be our primary focus in the future. While we will continue to sell and support our other products for the foreseeable future, they will not be an area of emphasis for us going forward.\n \u00b7 Expenses that typically do not require us to pay them in cash in the current period (such as depreciation, amortization and share-based compensation); \n \u00b7 Evolving our lead generation programs to increase our sales staff's exposure to potential purchasers. \n \u00b7 Operating lease for our office space. \nWe will apply the principles under ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (issued May 2014), beginning with consolidated financial statements we issue in 2018. We have evaluated the implementation of these principles resulting in the following observations:\nAs of December 31, 2017, after assessing the totality of the relevant events and circumstances, we determined it not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. Accordingly, we concluded there was no impairment of goodwill as of that date. There have been no material events or changes in circumstances since that time indicating that the carrying amount of goodwill may exceed its fair market value and that interim testing needed to be performed.\n\n \u00b7 Fees we pay to third parties who provide services supporting our SaaS subscription solutions for our EFT platform that generally have components that are both variable and not variable relative to revenue. \n \u2022 We estimate expected volatility based on historical volatility of our common stock. \nWe have determined that the application of ASU 2014-09 will have a material effect on the timing of our recording of expenses resulting from the incremental costs we incur to obtain a contract with a customer to deliver goods and services. These incremental costs consist primarily of sales commissions paid to our sales people and royalties on certain of our products paid to third parties. For years ended December 31, 2017, and earlier, we recorded the full amount of the sales commission and royalties paid on the full value of an M&S or SaaS contract as an expense on the inception date of the M&S contract. Under ASU 2014-09, we will account for such costs we incur in 2018 and later as follows:\n \u00b7 Using third-party digital marketing experts with search engine optimization expertise to enhance our efforts in this area. \nASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows - Restricted Cash (issued November 2016) - This pronouncement addresses the diversity of practice that exists in the classification and presentation of transfers between cash and restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. It provides that restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flow. Since we do not have any restricted cash balances, we do not expect this pronouncement to have a material effect on how we present items in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nOther Products\n \u00b7 A reduction in the value of our net deferred tax assets due to the reduction of the corporate income tax to 21% under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. \n \u2022 M&S revenue under contracts to provide ongoing product support and software updates to our customers who have purchased licensed software which we recognize ratably over the contractual period, which is typically one year but can be up to three years. \n \u00b7 Evolving our lead generation programs to increase our sales staff's exposure to potential purchasers. \nOur primary business is selling and supporting managed file transfer, or MFT, software for enterprises. MFT software facilitates the transfer of data from one location to another across a computer network within a single enterprise or between multiple computer networks in multiple enterprises.\nFor restricted stock awards, we use the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date as the fair value of the award.\nEFT Platform Products\nCost of software license revenue decreased 2.8% and as a percent of software license revenue was 27.3% in both 2017 and 2016. These minor fluctuations are primarily caused by the mix of products sold that are associated with a royalty and are well within our expectations.\nRevenue Growth\nWe follow accounting standards set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. This board sets GAAP, which we follow in preparing financial statements that report our financial position, results of operations, and sources and uses of cash. We also follow the reporting regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.\n \u00b7 Aligning our sales group to enhance its industry and geographic focus. \nIn considering these and other factors, we consider the extent to which any adverse events and circumstances identified could affect the comparison of our reporting unit's fair value with its carrying amount. We place more weight on events and circumstances that most affect our reporting unit's fair value or the carrying amount of our net assets. We consider positive and mitigating events and circumstances that may affect our determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. We evaluate, on the basis of the weight of the evidence, the significance of all identified events and circumstances in the context of determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.\nCash provided or used by our various activities consisted of the following ($ in thousands):\nSee Comparison of the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 for discussion of the variances between periods in the components comprising Adjusted EBITDA.\nCost of Revenues. These expenses are associated with the production, delivery and support of our products and services. We believe it is most meaningful to view cost of revenues as a percent of the revenues to which those costs relate since many of those costs are variable relative to revenue.\nKey Business Metrics\n \u00b7 Enhancing our support of channel partners and engaging them to sell our products through training, orientation and marketing programs. \n \u00b7 Evolving our lead generation programs to increase our sales staff's exposure to potential purchasers. \nWe have assessed the effect of ASU 2014-09 on the amount and timing of revenue we expect to recognize from our business activities in 2018 and later. We do not expect there to be material differences in the amount and timing of revenue we recognize from similar business activities in future periods determined by applying ASU 2014-09 as compared to revenue we would have otherwise recognized by applying GAAP as it existed prior to 2018.\n \u00b7 Implementing new sales and marketing campaigns. \n\u00b7 The amount of the sale is fixed or determinable.\nASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (issued March 2016) - When implemented, this standard will discontinue the recording in equity of tax benefits or tax deficiencies that arise from differences between share-based payment compensation expense recorded for financial statement purposes and that expense deductible for tax purposes. This new standard requires that the tax effect of all such differences be recorded and reported in the statement of operations. This standard also requires that tax-related cash flows resulting from share-based payments be reported as operating activities in the statement of cash flows which is a change from the current requirement to present such tax-related items as an inflow from financing activities and an outflow from operating activities. As prescribed by this standard, we adopted it beginning January 1, 2017, and followed it in the preparation of our financial statements as of December 31, 2017.\nWe plan to expend significant resources in the future for research and development of our products and expansion and enhancement of our sales and marketing activities. If sales decline or if our liquidity is otherwise under duress, we could substantially reduce personnel and personnel-related costs, reduce or substantially eliminate capital expenditures and/or reduce or substantially eliminate certain research and development and sales and marketing expenditures. We may also sell equity or debt securities or enter into credit arrangements in order to finance future acquisitions or licensing activities, to the extent available.\n\nOur total revenue increased 4.0%. Revenue from our EFT platform products and services increased 6.5%. That increase was offset by a 30.3% decrease in revenue from our other products consisting of Mail Express, WAFS, CuteFTP, and TappIn. The portion of our total revenue realized from those other products decreased to 4.6%.\n \u00b7 Ongoing innovation of our EFT platform to address the expanding needs of our existing customers and to enhance our products' appeal to new customers. \n \u00b7 Increasing sales staffing and capabilities as needed to address our markets. \n \u00b7 Under a perpetual software license for which they pay a one-time fee and under which they typically install our product on computers that they own and/or manage. Our brand name for this product is EFT. Almost all customers who purchase EFT also purchase a maintenance and support, or M&S, contract for which they pay us a recurring fee. Most of the revenue we have earned from our EFT platform products has been from sales of perpetual software licenses and related M&S. \n \u00b7 If these costs are associated with services for which we recognize revenue over time (primarily sales of M&S and SaaS subscriptions) for which we believe it is likely that the contract for those services will be renewed for additional terms in the future, provided we deem these costs to be recoverable, we will record these costs as deferred expense asset and amortize that cost to expense as follows: \nCost of M&S revenue as a percent of M&S revenue was substantially unchanged. Cost of revenue for M&S in absolute dollars increased by 14.7% due to an increase in M&S revenue. The cost of delivering M&S can vary slightly up or down from period-to-period, but we believe such changes are typically not indicative of long term trends or permanent changes in our cost of delivering M&S. Our gross margin on these services generally remains greater than 90% as a result of a consistent application of our customer support delivery protocols and practices.\nEarnings Per Share\n \u00b7 Enhancing our support of channel partners and engaging them to sell our products through training, orientation and marketing programs. \nFor stock option awards, we estimate their fair value at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model considering the following factors:\nOur application of ASU 2014-09 to incremental costs we incur to obtain a contract with a customer will result in our recording, as an asset as of January 1, 2018, a deferred expense of approximately $1.2 million applicable to contracts with customers in effect as of that date. We previously reported this amount as an expense in our consolidated financial statements for periods ending on and before December 31, 2017. We estimate that we will amortize this amount to expense at the rate of approximately $186,000 per quarter beginning in 2018. The incremental costs we incur to obtain contracts with customers during 2018 and later years, and the amount of such costs we record as a deferred expense and amortize to expense in subsequent periods, will depend upon the nature and scope of our future business activities, the nature and mix of the products and services we sell, the compensation plans we have in place for our sales people, and the royalty arrangements we enter into with third parties.\n \u00b7 Royalties we pay to use software developed by others for certain features of our products that is generally an expense that is variable relative to revenue. \nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP Measurement)\nOur total revenue increased 4% in 2017. For a more complete discussion of this revenue trend, see Comparison of the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nOur R&D expenditures expensed increased 21.7% and our R&D expenditures capitalized increased 25.2%. These results were due to our planned, continued increase in our capacity to develop new products as well as maintain our existing products and research technologies available from third-parties. We did this through a combination of increasing our engineering headcount and engaging additional third-party resources on a flexible basis as needed. In particular, we expended additional resources developing our Workspaces, Remote Agent and Cloud Connector EFT platform modules released in 2017 and our EFT Arcus product that we introduced in January 2018.\n \u00b7 We have assessed the effect of the principles relative to our business and the manner in which we recognize revenue. We have concluded that its application will not have a material effect on the amounts or timing of revenue we report in future periods. \nASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (issued May 2014) - The core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We will implement these new principles effective with consolidated financial statements we issue for the year ending December 31, 2018, and the quarterly periods during that year.\nWe review a number of key business metrics on an ongoing basis to help us monitor our performance and to identify material trends which may affect our business. The significant metrics we review are described below.\nSales and Marketing. We believe it meaningful to view cost of sales and marketing as a percent of revenues since many of those costs, particularly sales commissions, are variable relative to revenue. These expenses were 38.0% of total revenue for 2017 compared to 35.6% of total revenue for 2016. In absolute dollars these expenses increased 11.3%. These variations were primarily due to:\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, has issued the following Accounting Standard Updates (ASU) described below that we believe may be relevant to our business and to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 We base the risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. \nCost of M&S revenue and cost of professional services revenue consist primarily of salaries and related costs of our employees and third parties we use to deliver these services.\nWe utilize Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Total Other Income/Expense, Depreciation, Amortization, other than amortization of capitalized software development costs, and Share-Based Compensation Expense) to provide us a view of income and expenses that is supplemental and secondary to our primary assessment of net income as presented in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. We use Adjusted EBITDA to provide another perspective for measuring profitability from our core operating activities that does not include the effects of the following items:\nIn continuing to develop our demand generation activities, we have made and continue to make ongoing changes in sales and marketing including:\nComparison of the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nWhen we complete research and development for a software product and have in place a program plan and a detail program design or a working model of that software product, we capitalize production costs incurred for that software product from that point forward until it is ready for general release to the public. Thereafter, we amortize capitalized software production costs to expense using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of that product, which is generally three years. We periodically assess the carrying value of capitalized software development costs and our method of amortizing them relative to our estimates of realizability through sales of products in the marketplace.\n \u00b7 Accounts receivable decreasing $346,000 during 2017 compared to increasing $532,000 during 2016 primarily due to our ongoing work to improve the timeliness of our accounts receivable collections. \n o For the portion of the cost that we determine benefits us primarily only over the term of the specific underlying contract currently in force (such as the term of an M&S contract), we will recognize expense ratably each month over that term. \n \u2022 Macroeconomic conditions. \n \u00b7 We will adopt the new principles using the modified retrospective method. \nExpenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe components of our revenues were as follows ($ in thousands):\n\nOur capital requirements principally relate to our need to fund our ongoing operating expenditures, which are primarily related to employee salaries and benefits. We make these expenditures to enhance our existing products, develop new products, sell those products in the marketplace and support our customers after the sale.\nM&S Revenue - When we sell an EFT platform license, we also typically create a recurring revenue stream from M&S since almost all purchasers of our licensed products also purchase an M&S contract. In general, and depending upon the level of M&S a customer purchases, this recurring revenue stream is 20% to 30% per year of the price of the underlying software license to which the M&S relates.\n \u2022 We use primarily the simplified method to derive an expected term which represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding. We use this method because our options are plain-vanilla options, and we believe our historical option exercise experience is not adequately indicative of our future expectations. \nFinancing activities used more cash during 2017 than during 2016 primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from stock option exercises as a result 2017 having fewer departures of personnel with significant vested stock options. Former employees typically exercise their vested stock options shortly after the end of their employment.\nAs part of growing revenue in total, we are focused on increasing license revenue both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percent of total revenue. When we sell our licensed products, we also typically create a recurring revenue stream from M&S since almost all purchasers of our licensed enterprise products also purchase an M&S contract. Most of our M&S contracts are for one year although we also sell multi-year contracts. The customer pays us the M&S fee for the entire term of the agreement at the time the contract begins. We recognize that amount as revenue ratably in future periods over the term of the contract.\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the financial statements are published, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. It is possible the actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions and could have a material effect on the reported amounts of our financial position and results of operations.\n \u00b7 Federal and state taxes. \nWe focus on selling our EFT platform products in a business-to-business environment. The majority of the resources we will expend in the future for product research, development, marketing and sales will focus on EFT platform products. We expect to expend minimal resources developing and selling our other products. We believe our EFT platform products and business capabilities are well-positioned to compete effectively in the market for these products.\n \u00b7 Enhancing our sales and marketing programs to improve identification of potential demand for our products and to increase the rate at which we are successful in selling our products. \nOverview\n \u2022 Cost factors and trends for labor and other expenses of operating our business. \n \u00b7 Implementing new sales and marketing campaigns. \nTo support product innovation, we continue to enhance our software engineering group and our focus on optimizing the manner in which we assess the development of new technologies, our approach to managing those projects, and the timelines over which we do that work.\n \u00b7 An obligation to deliver services in the future to satisfy our right to earn our deferred revenue of $17.0 million. Those future services primarily relate to our obligations under M&S contracts. We will recognize this deferred revenue as revenue over the remaining life of those contracts which generally ranges from one to three years. Deferred revenue, unlike the other liability components of our working capital, is an obligation we will satisfy through providing services in the future to our customers as part of our ongoing operating activities from which we have historically generated cash flow. Our deferred revenue does not involve a disbursement of cash as a direct payment of that liability. \n \u00b7 We believe the application of the principles will result in a change in the manner in which we record sales commission expenses related to M&S contracts. Currently, we record the full amount of the sales commission paid on the full value of an M&S contract as an expense on the inception date of the M&S contract. After implementing ASU 2014-09, we will record that commission expense ratably over the term of the M&S contract. \nWe develop and sell computer software that provides secure information exchange, data transfer and sharing capabilities for enterprises and consumers. We have been in business for more than twenty years having sold our products to thousands of enterprises and more than one million individual consumers globally.\n \u00b7 Federal income tax receivable increasing $530,000 during 2017 compared to decreasing $229,000 during 2016 due to higher payments in 2017 as compared to 2016. In 2016 we did not make any federal income tax payments due to utilization of overpayments from 2015. \nOur cash provided by operating activities decreased during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the following factors set forth on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\nIn mid-2016, we announced that we would reduce our emphasis in the future on selling Mail Express, WAFS, CuteFTP, and TappIn products that are not part of our EFT platform. Collectively, these products constituted less than 5% and 10% of our total revenue in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Accordingly, during the second half of 2016, we began to curtail our product development and engineering resources for these products and significantly reduced our sales and marketing activities supporting them. As a result, our license and M&S revenue from those products collectively declined 30.3% in 2017 compared to 2016. Our future focus will continue to be on our EFT platform such that we expect to see a continuing decline in revenue from these other products although we do expect them to continue to produce a modest contribution margin that contributes to our future profitability.\n \u00b7 A decrease in bad debt expense as a result of an enhanced review of our accounts receivable during 2016 resulting in an increased write-off of accounts receivable in that period for which there was not a similar event during 2017 due to an improvement in our collections of accounts receivable. \n \u00b7 Enhancing our support of channel partners and engaging them to sell our products through training, orientation and marketing programs. \nWe collect sales tax on many of our sales. We do not include sales tax collected in our revenue. We record it as a liability payable to taxing authorities.", "item_7_text": "Liquidity and Capital Resources\nTotal resources expended for R&D set forth above as total R&D expenditures serves to illustrate our total corporate efforts to improve our existing products and to develop new products regardless of whether or not our expenditures for those efforts were expensed or capitalized. Total resources expended for R&D is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for R&D expense (set forth above as R&D expenditures expensed) and capitalized software development costs (set forth above as R&D expenditures capitalized) individually. While we believe the non-GAAP, total resources expended for R&D amount provides useful supplemental information regarding our overall corporate product improvement and new product creation activities, there are limitations associated with the use of this non-GAAP measurement. Total resources expended for R&D is a non-GAAP measure not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies since there is no standard for preparing this non-GAAP measure. As a result, this non-GAAP measure of total resources expended for R&D has limitations and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, R&D expense and capitalized software development cost individually.\nRevenue Recognition\n \u00b7 Aligning our sales group to enhance its industry and geographic focus. \nWe account for uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, we evaluate the tax position to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained, we assess the tax position to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The amount of the benefit we recognize is the largest amount that we believe has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions for which reserves have been established.\n \u2022 We estimate a dividend yield based on our historical and expected future dividend payments. \n \u00b7 Deferred revenue decreasing $395,000 during 2017 compared to increasing $1.2 million during 2016. This change was primarily due to an M&S contract supporting our EFT platform products used by the U.S. Army in connection with their Standard Army Maintenance System-Enhanced logistics program not being renewed at the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2017 as a result of the U.S. Army consolidating certain of their operations. \nWe develop, market and sell software products and services. We recognize revenue from a transaction when the following conditions are met:\nOur MFT products are based upon our Enhanced File Transfer, or EFT, platform. This platform emphasizes secure and efficient data exchange for virtually any organization. It enables business partners, customers and employees to share information safely and securely. The EFT platform provides enterprise-level security while automating the integration of back-end systems which are features often missing from traditional file transfer software. The EFT platform features built-in regulatory compliance, governance, and visibility controls to maintain data safety and security. It can replace legacy systems, homegrown servers, expensive leased lines and virtual area networks, all of which can be insecure, with a top-performing, scalable alternative. The EFT platform promotes ease of administration while providing the detailed capabilities necessary for complete control of a file transfer system.\nThis standard also permits an accounting policy election for the impact of forfeitures on the recognition of expense for share-based payment awards. Forfeitures may be either estimated (as has been the requirement in the past) or recognized when they occur. We elected to continue estimating forfeitures consistent with our existing practices thereby resulting in no change to our application of GAAP for this aspect of computing share-based compensation.\nLong-term investments consist of certificates of deposit held with financial institutions with contractual maturity dates greater than one year from the balance sheet date. The Company has the intent and ability to hold these investments until their maturity dates and therefore accounts for them as held-to-maturity. These certificates of deposit are stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair value of these investments.\nWe believe annual revenue growth is a key metric for monitoring our continued success in developing our business in future periods. Given our diverse solution portfolio, we regularly review our revenue mix and changes in revenue across all solutions to identify emerging trends. We believe our revenue growth is primarily dependent upon executing our business strategies which include:\n \u00b7 Aligning our sales group to enhance its industry and geographic focus. \nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\u00b7 Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists.\n \u00b7 The cost of financing our business; and \nIn the past, we reported bookings and potential future revenue as key business metrics. With the refinement of our revenue growth key business metric discussed above, we no longer rely on bookings or potential future revenue as key business metrics since we have determined that our revenue growth metric is the primary metric upon which we rely to measure the success of sales and marketing programs and our outlook for revenue in the future.\nSubstantially all of our EFT platform license revenue is from the sale of perpetual licenses to customers who install the software on computers they own or access in the cloud. In 2018, we released EFT Arcus, our SaaS offering of our EFT platform products, which replaced our EFT Cloud SaaS products that we sold prior to that time. Through December 31, 2017, we have not earned significant revenue from our EFT platform SaaS products. In the future, we will be placing a greater emphasis on promoting EFT Arcus to our customers. For the first 24 to 36 months that a customer subscribes to EFT Arcus, their cumulative cost of ownership will typically be less than their total cost of purchasing an EFT platform perpetual license combined with an M&S contract. Accordingly, we expect the revenue we earn during that period from an EFT Arcus customer will be less than the revenue we would earn from that same customer during that same period had they purchased a perpetual license with an M&S contract. As a result, during that period of time, we could experience a decrease in the growth rate of, or even a decline in revenue we earn from, the sale of new EFT platform perpetual licenses. We could also experience a decrease in the growth rate of our M&S revenue. However, we believe thereafter and over the long term, the cumulative, recurring revenue stream we will earn from EFT Arcus will exceed what we would have otherwise earned from the sale of a perpetual licenses combined with an M&S contract.\nLicense and M&S revenue from our EFT platform products increased 1.7%, and 13.1%, respectively. The increases across these products and services were primarily due to continued enhancement in our product development and software engineering groups which allowed us to refine our process for identifying new product opportunities, to better focus our resources on products that would yield larger and more immediate revenue opportunities, and to optimize our project management and software engineering processes to reduce the time necessary to produce new or improved products.\n \u00b7 New M&S contracts resulting from ongoing sales of EFT licenses that add to the base of M&S contracts already in place. \nCapitalized Software Development Costs\n \u00b7 Sustained, high renewal rates of M&S contracts by customers who initially purchased these services in earlier periods. We believe these renewals result from our programs designed to provide high-quality and responsive M&S services to our customers. \n \u00b7 Increased marketing activities related to competitive intelligence and channel development. \n \u00b7 Certain expenses in our consolidated financial statements, such as a portion of meals and entertainment expenses, that are not deductible on our federal income tax return. \n o For the portion of the cost that we determine benefits us over an overall customer relationship that is likely to span a period of time that is longer than an initial contract term (for example, an M&S contract renewed for multiple terms in the future), we will recognize expense ratably monthly over the estimated life of the customer relationship. \nIn June 2017, we introduced a data integration product that we planned to sell under the brand name Kenetix. We licensed the technology for this product from a third-party. We have experienced issues with the third-party technology and have determined to suspend marketing of the product as we evaluate options and determine whether the licensor can effectively address the issues.\n \u00b7 State income taxes included in income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements. \n \u00b7 If these costs are associated with products and services for which we recognize revenue at a point in time (primarily sales of perpetual software licenses and professional services), we will expense these costs in full at the time we recognize that revenue. \nFor a more comprehensive discussion of the products we sell and the services we offer, see Software Products and Services above.\nWe measure the cost of share-based payment transactions at the grant date based on the calculated fair value of the award. We recognize this cost as an expense ratably over the recipient's requisite service period during which that award vests or becomes unrestricted.\n \u00b7 We may access and monetize our certificates of deposit at any time without risk of loss of the original amounts invested. If we were to redeem these certificates of deposit prior to their maturity, we may incur a penalty and forfeit certain amounts of accrued interest. \nSee Comparison of the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 for a discussion of trends in our revenue growth that we monitor using this metric.\nA migration in the marketplace from purchasing our EFT platform products for a one-time, perpetual license fee, along with an associated contract for M&S services, to paying a monthly fee to access those products in a SaaS manner, could cause our revenue growth rate to decrease and could cause a short-term decline in our revenue. These decreases could occur because it can typically takes approximately 24 to 36 months for the cumulative revenue earned from delivering our EFT platform products for a monthly subscription fee to exceed the cumulative revenue we would earn from the combination of selling a perpetual license for a one-time fee along with an M&S contract.\nOur non-cancellable, contractual obligations at December 31, 2017, consisted of the following (in thousands):\nThe amount of cash we used for investing activities during 2017 decreased compared to 2016 due primarily to the purchase of certificates of deposit in 2016 for which there was no similar event in 2017.\nCost of professional services revenue as a percent of that revenue was 66.5% in 2017 as compared to 62.7% in 2016. This variation resulted from the varying scope and mix of the professional services we deliver that can change from period-to-period in response to the circumstances of the customer environments in which we are working. Because the cost of revenue for professional services is highly variable relative to our revenue from our services, this cost in absolute dollars decreased 13.1% due to a decrease in our professional services revenue for the reasons discussed above.\nASU 2017-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting (issued September 2017) - This update provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting. It states that in these situations, modification accounting should be applied unless the fair value of the modified award is the same as the fair value of the original award immediately before the original award was modified, the vesting conditions of the modified award are the same as the vesting conditions of the original award immediately before the original award was modified, and the classification of the modified award as equity or a liability is the same as the classification of the original award immediately before the original award was modified. This update is effective for all entities for annual periods including interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nASU 2015-17, Income Tax: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (issued November 2015) - This pronouncement requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities for a tax jurisdiction, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. We have implemented this ASU in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nOffset by:\nOffset by:\nCritical Accounting Policies\n \u00b7 The effects of income taxes. \nTo improve our ability to successfully sell existing EFT platform products and services as well as new products produced by our software engineering team, we continued to evolve our sales and marketing activities as follows:\nKey Business Metrics\nAdvertising Expense\n\u00b7 Collection of the sale amount is reasonably assured.\n \u00b7 Deferred revenue, unlike the other liability components of our working capital, is an obligation we will satisfy by providing services in the future to our customers as part of our ongoing operating activities from which we have historically generated cash flow. Our deferred revenue does not involve a disbursement of cash as a direct payment of that liability although we will incur operating expenses in the future as we deliver those M&S services. \nTo support product innovation, we continue to enhance our software engineering group and our focus on optimizing the manner in which we assess the development of new technologies, our approach to managing those projects, and the timelines over which we do that work. In continuing to develop our demand generation, marketing and sales activities, we have made and continue to make ongoing changes in sales and marketing including:\nIn the discussions below, we refer to the year ended December 31, 2017 as 2017\u201d and the year ended December 31, 2016, as 2016\u201d. The percentage changes cited in our discussions below are the change between 2017 and 2016.\nWe rely on cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flows from operations to fund our operating activities and believe those items will be our principal sources of capital for the foreseeable future. If our revenue declines and/or our expenses increase, our cash flow from operations and cash on hand could decline.\nWe compute basic earnings per share using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the periods. We compute diluted earnings per share using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding.\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n \u00b7 Accounts payable increasing $970,000 in 2017 compared to increasing $91,000 during 2016 primarily due to the abnormally high payables related to expenses from the Investigation and normal variations in the timing of payments to our vendors. \nWe earn most of our revenue from the sale of products and services that are part of our EFT platform. Our customers can purchase the capabilities of our EFT platform in two ways:\nCash and cash equivalents includes all cash and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.\nWe earn revenue primarily from the following activities:\n \u00b7 Licensing, developing and/or acquiring technologies with features and functions that are complementary to and synergistic with our EFT platform so as to expand the breadth of our product offerings. \nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe believe that continuing to offer licensed products installed on-premises for which we recognize revenue up-front and that carry with them a recurring M&S revenue stream continues to be important to our future success. At the same time, we recognize that a migration of capabilities to a SaaS platform is attractive to a growing number of customers. We have, and have had for quite some time, the capabilities in place to deliver our EFT platform in that manner. In 2018, we released EFT Arcus as our newest offering of the EFT platform as SaaS.\n \u2022 License revenue from sales of our Mail Express, WAFS and CuteFTP products that are installed at the customer's premises under a perpetual license for which we earn the full amount of the license revenue at the time the license is delivered. \n \u00b7 Increasing sales staff capacity as needed to address our markets. \nCost of license revenue consists primarily of:\nOur M&S contracts are typically for one year with some customers buying two or three year contracts. The customer pays us the M&S fee for the entire term of the agreement at the time the contract begins. We recognize that amount as revenue ratably in future periods over the term of the contract.\nIncome Taxes\n \u00b7 A decrease in bonus payments to certain of our personnel due to our financial results for 2017 not achieving the objectives necessary for them to receive bonus payments in the amounts paid in 2016. \nLong-Term Investments\n \u00b7 An obligation under a contract with a third party to make future minimum prepaid royalty payments in the amount of $800,000 in September 2018 and $1.2 million in November 2019. \nResearch and Development. The overall profile of our research and development activities was as follows ($ in thousands):\nFor a sale transaction not meeting any one of these four criteria, we defer recognition of revenue related to that transaction until all the criteria are met.\nThese trends are in line with our expectations as a result of our strategy implemented in mid-2016 to focus our efforts primarily on our EFT platform products. At the same time, we decided that while we would continue selling our other products, we would de-emphasize them in the future, not expend future significant product development and engineering resources to enhance those products, and not dedicate significant future sales and marketing activities to them. We intend to maintain our focus on our EFT platform for the foreseeable future such that we expect to see a continuing decline in revenue from our products other than those that are part of the EFT platform.\n \u2022 Industry and market considerations. \nGoodwill\n\nResearch and Development\nAwards of non-vested options are considered potentially dilutive common shares for the purpose of computing earnings per common share. We apply the treasury stock method to non-vested options under which the assumed proceeds include the amount the employee must pay to exercise the option plus the amount of unrecognized cost attributable to future periods less any expected tax benefits.\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes, as measured by the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are carried on the balance sheet with the presumption that they will be realizable in future periods in which we generate taxable income.\nWe sell other products that are synergistic to our EFT platform including Mail Express, WAFS, and CuteFTP. Collectively, these products constituted less than 5% of our total revenue in 2017. Customers pay a one-time fee to purchase these products under a perpetual software license. Some customers also purchase an M&S contract. We do not offer a SaaS version of these products and have no plans to do so.\n \u00b7 Severance pay related to the departure of the former chief executive officer in 2016 for which there was not a similar event in 2017. \nWe assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income. Based on this assessment, we provide any necessary valuation allowance on our balance sheet with a corresponding increase in the tax provision on our statement of operations. Any valuation allowances we establish are determined based upon a number of assumptions, judgments, and estimates, including forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic jurisdictions in which we operate.\n \u00b7 Net income after considering adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities decreasing from $6.7 million in 2016 to $5.5 million in 2017. The primary cause of this decrease was the expenses we incurred in connection with the Investigation. See the section below under Comparison of the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 for a discussion of additional factors that contributed to this variation. \nOur professional services revenue was $483,000 less for 2017 compared to 2016 which is a decrease of 17.9%. Going into 2016, we had a backlog of professional services engagements that arose from software sales in previous periods. We worked down that backlog during 2016 which resulted in our professional services revenue being higher than typical for 2016 relative to software license revenue. There was not a similar backlog going into 2017 such that our professional services revenue for 2017 decreased as compared to 2016 but was at a level relative to software license sales that we believe to be more typical. In addition, during 2017 we began to focus more on selling pre-packaged professional services (as compared to customized services) which, while yielding lower total revenue from professional services, allowed us to deliver professional services more efficiently and without the unpredictability that can arise with customized services.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nWe also earn revenue from professional services we provide to assist our customers in configuring and integrating our EFT platform products into their environments.\nASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (issued January 2017) - To simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill, Step 2 was eliminated from the goodwill impairment test. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, an entity was required to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities) following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Instead, under the amendments in this update, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. Any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. This update also eliminated the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and, if it fails that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. Therefore, the same impairment assessment applies to all reporting units. An entity is required to disclose the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount of net assets. An entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. A public business entity that is a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filer is required to adopt the amendments in this update for its annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We expect that the application of the provisions of this update will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe typically experience a high renewal rate for M&S services for our enterprise products so long as a customer continues using the licensed product they purchased from us. As a result, growing license revenue not only contributes to increasing revenue growth at the time the license is sold but also provides a foundation for future recurring revenue as the purchasers of our licensed products renew M&S contracts to support their ongoing product support needs. This pattern of activity can create a cumulative effect for M&S renewals as a result of the cumulative number of licensed software installations sold over multiple years that create M&S renewals in any single year predictably (and in line with our expectations) exceeding the number of new software licenses we sell in a single year. We expect this cumulative effect to continue to grow if we continue to increase enterprise software license revenue in future periods. For these reasons, we expect M&S revenue will remain a substantial part of our total revenue.\nFor our products licensed and delivered under a SaaS transaction on a monthly or other periodic subscription basis, we recognize subscription revenue, including initial setup fees, on a monthly basis ratably over the contractual term of the customer contract as we deliver our products and services. Amounts paid prior to this revenue recognition are presented as deferred revenue until earned.\nASU 2016-02, Leases (issued February 2016). The main difference between existing GAAP and this ASU 2016-02 is the presentation by lessees on their financial statements of lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases. Since this new standard retains the distinction between finance and operating leases, the effect of leases in the statement of operations and the statement of cash flows will be largely unchanged from existing GAAP. Our only lease of significance is our operating lease for our corporate office space for which we will present a right-to-use asset and a lease liability on our balance sheet when we implement this standard. We are in the process of determining those amounts. In accordance with this standard, we will implement it beginning with our interim and annual financial statements for 2019. The extent of the effect of this standard on our consolidated financial statements for 2019 and later will depend upon the leases, if any, that we have in effect at that date.\nIn mid-2016, we reviewed the allocation of our product research, development, sales and marketing resources across all of our products. As a result of that review, we decided to adjust that allocation to focus most of our resources involved in product research and development, as well as our sales and marketing activities, on our EFT platform products in order to expand their capabilities and to remain positioned to be responsive to the evolving needs of our customers. Accordingly, we do not expect to expend significant resources in the future on expanding the features and capabilities of, or on sales and marketing programs for, Mail Express, WAFS and CuteFTP. We plan to continue providing customer support for those products for the foreseeable future.\nProperty and Equipment\n \u00b7 Increasing sales staffing and capabilities as needed to address our markets. \nWe monitor Adjusted EBITDA to assess our performance relative to our intended strategies, expected patterns of action, and budgets. We use the results of that assessment to adjust our future activities to the extent we deem necessary.\nIncome Taxes. Our effective tax rate was 53.0% for 2017 and 33.4% for 2016. These rates differed from a federal statutory tax rate of 34% primarily due to:\n\n \u00b7 Increased professional fees and related expenses totaling $2.5 million associated with the Investigation, the Restatement and related litigation. \nAt December 31, 2017, our short term investments consisted of certificates of deposit maturing on various dates through 2018. Our long term investments as of that date consisted of a certificate of deposit maturing in December 2021.\n\nOur cash and working capital positions were as follows ($ in thousands):\nShare-Based Compensation\nASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (issued June 2016) - Among the provisions of this ASU is a requirement that assets measured at amortized cost, which includes trade accounts receivable, be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. This pronouncement requires that an entity reflect all of its expected credit losses based on current estimates which will replace the current standard requiring that an entity need consider only past events and current conditions in measuring an incurred loss. We are subject to this guidance effective with consolidated financial statements we issue for the year ending December 31, 2020, and the quarterly periods during that year. We do not expect the amounts we report as accounts receivable in those future periods under this guidance to be materially affected relative to current guidance.\n \u2022 Trends in the quoted market value and trading of our common stock. \nOther Income. Other income consists primarily of interest income earned on certificates of deposit. The increase in this amount was due primarily to enhanced investment of our cash beginning in the second half of 2016 to earn a higher rate of interest.\n \u00b7 Trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities which include our contractual obligations to pay software royalties to third parties that vary in amount based on our sales volume of products upon which royalties are payable. \nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and related notes included elsewhere in this document. Our consolidated financial information as of December 31, 2016, and for the year then ended, presented within this Form 10-K reflects the effects of the Restatement.\nAt December 31, 2017, our contractual obligations and commitments consisted primarily of the following items:\nWe earn the majority of our software license revenue from software products sold under perpetual software license agreements. At the time our customers purchase these products, they typically also purchase an M&S contract. These transactions are multiple element software sales for which we assess the presence of vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d) of the fair value of the undelivered elements to determine the portion of these sales to recognize as revenue upon delivery of the software product and the portion of these sales to record as deferred revenue at the time the product is delivered. We amortize the deferred revenue component to revenue in future periods on a straight-line method as we deliver the related future services to the customer. For transactions, if any, for which we cannot establish VSOE of the fair value of the undelivered elements, we initially record the entire transaction as deferred revenue and amortize that amount to revenue in future periods as we deliver the related future services to the customer.\n \u00b7 Implementing new sales and marketing campaigns. \nWe compute Adjusted EBITDA as follows ($ in thousands):\nWe remain alert for attractive opportunities to collaborate with others or perhaps combine other revenue-producing technologies with ours to expand our product offerings and reach. To that end, we continually assess products and services offered by others that might be synergistic with our existing products. We may elect to take advantage of those opportunities through cooperative marketing agreements or licensing arrangements or by acquiring an ownership position in the enterprise offering the opportunity.\nWe provide services under M&S contracts with terms generally ranging from one to three years. We require up-front payment of our M&S fee in an amount that covers the entire term of the agreement. We record as deferred revenue amounts due or paid that relate to future periods during which we will provide the M&S service. Deferred revenue related to services we will deliver within one year is presented as a current liability while deferred revenue related to services that we will deliver more than one year into the future is presented as a non-current liability. We reduce deferred revenue and recognize revenue ratably in future periods on a straight-line method as we deliver the M&S service.\nShort Term Investments\nCash and cash equivalents\nGoodwill is not amortized. On at least an annual basis, we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level using December 31 as the measurement date. We operate as a single reporting unit.\nShort-term investments consist of certificates of deposit held with financial institutions with contractual maturity dates less than one year from the balance sheet date. The Company has the intent and ability to hold these investments until their maturity dates and therefore accounts for them as held-to-maturity. These certificates of deposit are stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair value of these investments.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. It should not be considered as a substitute for net income presented on our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and when assessing our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or without a simultaneous reading and consideration of our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (issued June 2016) - This pronouncement provides guidance as to the treatment of transactions in a statement of cash flows with respect to eight specific cash flow issues. During 2017 and 2016, we had no transactions of the type cited in the statement and do not anticipate having any such transactions in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, we do not expect this pronouncement to have a material effect on how we present items in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nOur discussion of the business trends of our products is based on the following profile of our revenue components ($ in thousands):\nIf, after assessing the totality of these qualitative events and circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we conclude there is no impairment of goodwill and perform no further testing in accordance with GAAP. If we conclude otherwise, we proceed with performing the first step, and if necessary, the second step, of the two-step goodwill impairment test prescribed by GAAP.\n\nWe expense advertising costs as incurred as a component of our sales and marketing expenses.\nWe record the effect of new tax legislation in the period in which it is signed into law.\n \u2022 License revenue from sales of our EFT platform products that we deliver as either perpetually-licensed software installed at the customer's premises, for which we earn the full amount of the license revenue at the time the license is delivered, or as a cloud-based service delivered using a SaaS model, for which we earn monthly subscription revenue as these services are delivered. \nSolution Perspective and Trends\n \u00b7 Amortization of capitalized software development costs we incur when producing our software products. This amortization begins when a product is ready for general release to the public and generally is an expense that is not directly variable relative to revenue. \nProperty and equipment is comprised of furniture and fixtures, software, computer equipment and leasehold improvements which are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Furniture, fixtures and equipment have a useful life of five to seven years, computer equipment and software have a useful life of three years and leasehold improvements have a useful life that is the shorter of the term of the lease under which the improvements were made or the estimated useful life of the asset.\nWe typically experience a high renewal rate for M&S services for our enterprise products so long as a customer continues using the licensed product they purchased from us. As a result, the sale of an EFT platform license not only contributes to license revenue but also provides a foundation for future recurring revenue as the purchasers of our licensed products typically continue to renew M&S contracts to support their ongoing product support needs. This pattern of activity can create a cumulative effect for M&S renewals as a result of the cumulative number of licensed software installations sold over multiple years that create M&S renewals in any single year predictably (and in line with our expectations) exceeding the number of new software licenses we sell in a single year. We expect this cumulative effect to continue to grow if we continue to increase enterprise software license revenue in future periods.\n\n \u00b7 Increased sales lead generation activities. \n \u2022 Our overall financial performance and outlook for the future. \n \u00b7 Increasing the size of our sales, marketing and product strategy teams and increased compensation rates due to competitive demands in the marketplace. \n \u2022 Professional services revenue from a variety of implementation and integration services, as well as delivery of education and training associated with our solutions, which we recognize as the services are completed. \nWhen testing goodwill, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. In performing this qualitative assessment, we assess events and circumstances relevant to us including, but not limited to:\nCost of revenue consists of expenses associated with the production, delivery and support of the products and services we sell. Cost of license revenue consists primarily of amortization of the capitalized software development costs we incur when producing our software products, royalties we pay to use software developed by others for certain features of our products, and fees we pay to third parties who provide services supporting our SaaS solutions. Cost of M&S revenue and cost of professional services revenue consist primarily of salaries and related costs of our employees and third parties we use to deliver these services.\nOffset by:\n \u00b7 As a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, under which they pay us ongoing fees to access the capabilities of the EFT platform in the cloud. Through the end of 2017, EFT Cloud was our SaaS offering of the EFT platform which users accessed for a flat monthly subscription fee. In January 2018, we introduced EFT Arcus, which will be our SaaS offering of the EFT platform going forward, for which users will pay a base monthly subscription fee plus an additional variable amount determined based upon their metered usage of EFT Arcus resources. \nCost of revenue\n \u00b7 The domestic production activities deduction and the research and development credit that are tax credit incentives that serve to reduce the rate at which we pay federal income taxes in exchange for us conducting certain aspects of our business in a manner promoted by the Internal Revenue Code. \nResults of Operations\nWe provide professional services to our customers consisting primarily of software installation support, operations support and training. We recognize revenue from these services as they are completed and accepted by our customers.\nM&S revenue from our EFT platform products increased 13.1% primarily due to:\n \u00b7 An increase in professional fees paid to third-party advisors and our registered independent public accountants related to the independent audit of our internal controls in 2017 that was required for the first time due to us becoming an accelerated filer under SEC regulations. \n \u00b7 An increase in share-based compensation expense due to a higher average number of options outstanding in 2017 compared to 2016. Our options outstanding increased as we continued to grant options to attract and retain key personnel in a competitive marketplace for talent. \n\u00b7 Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered.\nGeneral and Administrative. These expenses increased 30.5% primarily due to:\nWhen assessing our liquidity and capital resources, we consider the following factors:\nAt the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2017 the U.S. Army did not renew their M&S contract used in connection with their Standard Army Maintenance System-Enhanced logistics program due to consolidation of certain of their operations. This contract provided approximately $1.9 million annually in M&S revenue.\nWe earn most of our revenue from the sale of our EFT platform products and the associated M&S and professional services related to those products. With our core competency being in products that address the MFT market, we believe our EFT platform products provide the best opportunity for our future growth. Accordingly, expansion of the capabilities of the EFT platform will be our primary focus in the future. While we will continue to sell and support our other products for the foreseeable future, they will not be an area of emphasis for us going forward.\n \u00b7 Expenses that typically do not require us to pay them in cash in the current period (such as depreciation, amortization and share-based compensation); \n \u00b7 Evolving our lead generation programs to increase our sales staff's exposure to potential purchasers. \n \u00b7 Operating lease for our office space. \nWe will apply the principles under ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (issued May 2014), beginning with consolidated financial statements we issue in 2018. We have evaluated the implementation of these principles resulting in the following observations:\nAs of December 31, 2017, after assessing the totality of the relevant events and circumstances, we determined it not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. Accordingly, we concluded there was no impairment of goodwill as of that date. There have been no material events or changes in circumstances since that time indicating that the carrying amount of goodwill may exceed its fair market value and that interim testing needed to be performed.\n\n \u00b7 Fees we pay to third parties who provide services supporting our SaaS subscription solutions for our EFT platform that generally have components that are both variable and not variable relative to revenue. \n \u2022 We estimate expected volatility based on historical volatility of our common stock. \nWe have determined that the application of ASU 2014-09 will have a material effect on the timing of our recording of expenses resulting from the incremental costs we incur to obtain a contract with a customer to deliver goods and services. These incremental costs consist primarily of sales commissions paid to our sales people and royalties on certain of our products paid to third parties. For years ended December 31, 2017, and earlier, we recorded the full amount of the sales commission and royalties paid on the full value of an M&S or SaaS contract as an expense on the inception date of the M&S contract. Under ASU 2014-09, we will account for such costs we incur in 2018 and later as follows:\n \u00b7 Using third-party digital marketing experts with search engine optimization expertise to enhance our efforts in this area. \nASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows - Restricted Cash (issued November 2016) - This pronouncement addresses the diversity of practice that exists in the classification and presentation of transfers between cash and restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. It provides that restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flow. Since we do not have any restricted cash balances, we do not expect this pronouncement to have a material effect on how we present items in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nOther Products\n \u00b7 A reduction in the value of our net deferred tax assets due to the reduction of the corporate income tax to 21% under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. \n \u2022 M&S revenue under contracts to provide ongoing product support and software updates to our customers who have purchased licensed software which we recognize ratably over the contractual period, which is typically one year but can be up to three years. \n \u00b7 Evolving our lead generation programs to increase our sales staff's exposure to potential purchasers. \nOur primary business is selling and supporting managed file transfer, or MFT, software for enterprises. MFT software facilitates the transfer of data from one location to another across a computer network within a single enterprise or between multiple computer networks in multiple enterprises.\nFor restricted stock awards, we use the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date as the fair value of the award.\nEFT Platform Products\nCost of software license revenue decreased 2.8% and as a percent of software license revenue was 27.3% in both 2017 and 2016. These minor fluctuations are primarily caused by the mix of products sold that are associated with a royalty and are well within our expectations.\nRevenue Growth\nWe follow accounting standards set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. This board sets GAAP, which we follow in preparing financial statements that report our financial position, results of operations, and sources and uses of cash. We also follow the reporting regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.\n \u00b7 Aligning our sales group to enhance its industry and geographic focus. \nIn considering these and other factors, we consider the extent to which any adverse events and circumstances identified could affect the comparison of our reporting unit's fair value with its carrying amount. We place more weight on events and circumstances that most affect our reporting unit's fair value or the carrying amount of our net assets. We consider positive and mitigating events and circumstances that may affect our determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. We evaluate, on the basis of the weight of the evidence, the significance of all identified events and circumstances in the context of determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.\nCash provided or used by our various activities consisted of the following ($ in thousands):\nSee Comparison of the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 for discussion of the variances between periods in the components comprising Adjusted EBITDA.\nCost of Revenues. These expenses are associated with the production, delivery and support of our products and services. We believe it is most meaningful to view cost of revenues as a percent of the revenues to which those costs relate since many of those costs are variable relative to revenue.\nKey Business Metrics\n \u00b7 Enhancing our support of channel partners and engaging them to sell our products through training, orientation and marketing programs. \n \u00b7 Evolving our lead generation programs to increase our sales staff's exposure to potential purchasers. \nWe have assessed the effect of ASU 2014-09 on the amount and timing of revenue we expect to recognize from our business activities in 2018 and later. We do not expect there to be material differences in the amount and timing of revenue we recognize from similar business activities in future periods determined by applying ASU 2014-09 as compared to revenue we would have otherwise recognized by applying GAAP as it existed prior to 2018.\n \u00b7 Implementing new sales and marketing campaigns. \n\u00b7 The amount of the sale is fixed or determinable.\nASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (issued March 2016) - When implemented, this standard will discontinue the recording in equity of tax benefits or tax deficiencies that arise from differences between share-based payment compensation expense recorded for financial statement purposes and that expense deductible for tax purposes. This new standard requires that the tax effect of all such differences be recorded and reported in the statement of operations. This standard also requires that tax-related cash flows resulting from share-based payments be reported as operating activities in the statement of cash flows which is a change from the current requirement to present such tax-related items as an inflow from financing activities and an outflow from operating activities. As prescribed by this standard, we adopted it beginning January 1, 2017, and followed it in the preparation of our financial statements as of December 31, 2017.\nWe plan to expend significant resources in the future for research and development of our products and expansion and enhancement of our sales and marketing activities. If sales decline or if our liquidity is otherwise under duress, we could substantially reduce personnel and personnel-related costs, reduce or substantially eliminate capital expenditures and/or reduce or substantially eliminate certain research and development and sales and marketing expenditures. We may also sell equity or debt securities or enter into credit arrangements in order to finance future acquisitions or licensing activities, to the extent available.\n\nOur total revenue increased 4.0%. Revenue from our EFT platform products and services increased 6.5%. That increase was offset by a 30.3% decrease in revenue from our other products consisting of Mail Express, WAFS, CuteFTP, and TappIn. The portion of our total revenue realized from those other products decreased to 4.6%.\n \u00b7 Ongoing innovation of our EFT platform to address the expanding needs of our existing customers and to enhance our products' appeal to new customers. \n \u00b7 Increasing sales staffing and capabilities as needed to address our markets. \n \u00b7 Under a perpetual software license for which they pay a one-time fee and under which they typically install our product on computers that they own and/or manage. Our brand name for this product is EFT. Almost all customers who purchase EFT also purchase a maintenance and support, or M&S, contract for which they pay us a recurring fee. Most of the revenue we have earned from our EFT platform products has been from sales of perpetual software licenses and related M&S. \n \u00b7 If these costs are associated with services for which we recognize revenue over time (primarily sales of M&S and SaaS subscriptions) for which we believe it is likely that the contract for those services will be renewed for additional terms in the future, provided we deem these costs to be recoverable, we will record these costs as deferred expense asset and amortize that cost to expense as follows: \nCost of M&S revenue as a percent of M&S revenue was substantially unchanged. Cost of revenue for M&S in absolute dollars increased by 14.7% due to an increase in M&S revenue. The cost of delivering M&S can vary slightly up or down from period-to-period, but we believe such changes are typically not indicative of long term trends or permanent changes in our cost of delivering M&S. Our gross margin on these services generally remains greater than 90% as a result of a consistent application of our customer support delivery protocols and practices.\nEarnings Per Share\n \u00b7 Enhancing our support of channel partners and engaging them to sell our products through training, orientation and marketing programs. \nFor stock option awards, we estimate their fair value at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model considering the following factors:\nOur application of ASU 2014-09 to incremental costs we incur to obtain a contract with a customer will result in our recording, as an asset as of January 1, 2018, a deferred expense of approximately $1.2 million applicable to contracts with customers in effect as of that date. We previously reported this amount as an expense in our consolidated financial statements for periods ending on and before December 31, 2017. We estimate that we will amortize this amount to expense at the rate of approximately $186,000 per quarter beginning in 2018. The incremental costs we incur to obtain contracts with customers during 2018 and later years, and the amount of such costs we record as a deferred expense and amortize to expense in subsequent periods, will depend upon the nature and scope of our future business activities, the nature and mix of the products and services we sell, the compensation plans we have in place for our sales people, and the royalty arrangements we enter into with third parties.\n \u00b7 Royalties we pay to use software developed by others for certain features of our products that is generally an expense that is variable relative to revenue. \nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP Measurement)\nOur total revenue increased 4% in 2017. For a more complete discussion of this revenue trend, see Comparison of the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nOur R&D expenditures expensed increased 21.7% and our R&D expenditures capitalized increased 25.2%. These results were due to our planned, continued increase in our capacity to develop new products as well as maintain our existing products and research technologies available from third-parties. We did this through a combination of increasing our engineering headcount and engaging additional third-party resources on a flexible basis as needed. In particular, we expended additional resources developing our Workspaces, Remote Agent and Cloud Connector EFT platform modules released in 2017 and our EFT Arcus product that we introduced in January 2018.\n \u00b7 We have assessed the effect of the principles relative to our business and the manner in which we recognize revenue. We have concluded that its application will not have a material effect on the amounts or timing of revenue we report in future periods. \nASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (issued May 2014) - The core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We will implement these new principles effective with consolidated financial statements we issue for the year ending December 31, 2018, and the quarterly periods during that year.\nWe review a number of key business metrics on an ongoing basis to help us monitor our performance and to identify material trends which may affect our business. The significant metrics we review are described below.\nSales and Marketing. We believe it meaningful to view cost of sales and marketing as a percent of revenues since many of those costs, particularly sales commissions, are variable relative to revenue. These expenses were 38.0% of total revenue for 2017 compared to 35.6% of total revenue for 2016. In absolute dollars these expenses increased 11.3%. These variations were primarily due to:\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, has issued the following Accounting Standard Updates (ASU) described below that we believe may be relevant to our business and to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 We base the risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. \nCost of M&S revenue and cost of professional services revenue consist primarily of salaries and related costs of our employees and third parties we use to deliver these services.\nWe utilize Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Total Other Income/Expense, Depreciation, Amortization, other than amortization of capitalized software development costs, and Share-Based Compensation Expense) to provide us a view of income and expenses that is supplemental and secondary to our primary assessment of net income as presented in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. We use Adjusted EBITDA to provide another perspective for measuring profitability from our core operating activities that does not include the effects of the following items:\nIn continuing to develop our demand generation activities, we have made and continue to make ongoing changes in sales and marketing including:\nComparison of the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nWhen we complete research and development for a software product and have in place a program plan and a detail program design or a working model of that software product, we capitalize production costs incurred for that software product from that point forward until it is ready for general release to the public. Thereafter, we amortize capitalized software production costs to expense using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of that product, which is generally three years. We periodically assess the carrying value of capitalized software development costs and our method of amortizing them relative to our estimates of realizability through sales of products in the marketplace.\n \u00b7 Accounts receivable decreasing $346,000 during 2017 compared to increasing $532,000 during 2016 primarily due to our ongoing work to improve the timeliness of our accounts receivable collections. \n o For the portion of the cost that we determine benefits us primarily only over the term of the specific underlying contract currently in force (such as the term of an M&S contract), we will recognize expense ratably each month over that term. \n \u2022 Macroeconomic conditions. \n \u00b7 We will adopt the new principles using the modified retrospective method. \nExpenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe components of our revenues were as follows ($ in thousands):\n\nOur capital requirements principally relate to our need to fund our ongoing operating expenditures, which are primarily related to employee salaries and benefits. We make these expenditures to enhance our existing products, develop new products, sell those products in the marketplace and support our customers after the sale.\nM&S Revenue - When we sell an EFT platform license, we also typically create a recurring revenue stream from M&S since almost all purchasers of our licensed products also purchase an M&S contract. In general, and depending upon the level of M&S a customer purchases, this recurring revenue stream is 20% to 30% per year of the price of the underlying software license to which the M&S relates.\n \u2022 We use primarily the simplified method to derive an expected term which represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding. We use this method because our options are plain-vanilla options, and we believe our historical option exercise experience is not adequately indicative of our future expectations. \nFinancing activities used more cash during 2017 than during 2016 primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from stock option exercises as a result 2017 having fewer departures of personnel with significant vested stock options. Former employees typically exercise their vested stock options shortly after the end of their employment.\nAs part of growing revenue in total, we are focused on increasing license revenue both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percent of total revenue. When we sell our licensed products, we also typically create a recurring revenue stream from M&S since almost all purchasers of our licensed enterprise products also purchase an M&S contract. Most of our M&S contracts are for one year although we also sell multi-year contracts. The customer pays us the M&S fee for the entire term of the agreement at the time the contract begins. We recognize that amount as revenue ratably in future periods over the term of the contract.\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the financial statements are published, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. It is possible the actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions and could have a material effect on the reported amounts of our financial position and results of operations.\n \u00b7 Federal and state taxes. \nWe focus on selling our EFT platform products in a business-to-business environment. The majority of the resources we will expend in the future for product research, development, marketing and sales will focus on EFT platform products. We expect to expend minimal resources developing and selling our other products. We believe our EFT platform products and business capabilities are well-positioned to compete effectively in the market for these products.\n \u00b7 Enhancing our sales and marketing programs to improve identification of potential demand for our products and to increase the rate at which we are successful in selling our products. \nOverview\n \u2022 Cost factors and trends for labor and other expenses of operating our business. \n \u00b7 Implementing new sales and marketing campaigns. \nTo support product innovation, we continue to enhance our software engineering group and our focus on optimizing the manner in which we assess the development of new technologies, our approach to managing those projects, and the timelines over which we do that work.\n \u00b7 An obligation to deliver services in the future to satisfy our right to earn our deferred revenue of $17.0 million. Those future services primarily relate to our obligations under M&S contracts. We will recognize this deferred revenue as revenue over the remaining life of those contracts which generally ranges from one to three years. Deferred revenue, unlike the other liability components of our working capital, is an obligation we will satisfy through providing services in the future to our customers as part of our ongoing operating activities from which we have historically generated cash flow. Our deferred revenue does not involve a disbursement of cash as a direct payment of that liability. \n \u00b7 We believe the application of the principles will result in a change in the manner in which we record sales commission expenses related to M&S contracts. Currently, we record the full amount of the sales commission paid on the full value of an M&S contract as an expense on the inception date of the M&S contract. After implementing ASU 2014-09, we will record that commission expense ratably over the term of the M&S contract. \nWe develop and sell computer software that provides secure information exchange, data transfer and sharing capabilities for enterprises and consumers. We have been in business for more than twenty years having sold our products to thousands of enterprises and more than one million individual consumers globally.\n \u00b7 Federal income tax receivable increasing $530,000 during 2017 compared to decreasing $229,000 during 2016 due to higher payments in 2017 as compared to 2016. In 2016 we did not make any federal income tax payments due to utilization of overpayments from 2015. \nOur cash provided by operating activities decreased during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the following factors set forth on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\nIn mid-2016, we announced that we would reduce our emphasis in the future on selling Mail Express, WAFS, CuteFTP, and TappIn products that are not part of our EFT platform. Collectively, these products constituted less than 5% and 10% of our total revenue in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Accordingly, during the second half of 2016, we began to curtail our product development and engineering resources for these products and significantly reduced our sales and marketing activities supporting them. As a result, our license and M&S revenue from those products collectively declined 30.3% in 2017 compared to 2016. Our future focus will continue to be on our EFT platform such that we expect to see a continuing decline in revenue from these other products although we do expect them to continue to produce a modest contribution margin that contributes to our future profitability.\n \u00b7 A decrease in bad debt expense as a result of an enhanced review of our accounts receivable during 2016 resulting in an increased write-off of accounts receivable in that period for which there was not a similar event during 2017 due to an improvement in our collections of accounts receivable. \n \u00b7 Enhancing our support of channel partners and engaging them to sell our products through training, orientation and marketing programs. \nWe collect sales tax on many of our sales. We do not include sales tax collected in our revenue. We record it as a liability payable to taxing authorities.", "item_7_tables": "Table 265: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ending December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>
