Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nMD&A is intended to inform the reader about matters affecting the financial condition and results of operations of SMLP and its subsidiaries. As a result, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this report. Among other things, the consolidated financial statements and the related notes include more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following information. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that constitute our plans, estimates and beliefs. These forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those discussed in Forward-Looking Statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\nThis MD&A comprises the following sections:\nTable 224: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Overview\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Trends and Outlook\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> How We Evaluate Our Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 228: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Liquidity and Capital Resources\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 229: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Critical Accounting Estimates\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 230: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Forward-Looking Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview\nWe are a growth-oriented limited partnership focused on developing, owning and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets that are strategically located in the core producing areas of unconventional resource basins, primarily shale formations, in the continental United States.\nWe classify our midstream energy infrastructure assets into two categories:\nTable 231: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Core Focus Areas - production basins in which we expect our gathering systems to experience greater long-term growth, driven by our customers ability to generate more favorable returns and support sustained drilling and completion activity in varying commodity price environments.

Our Utica Shale, Ohio Gathering, Williston Basin, DJ Basin and Permian Basin reportable segments (as described below) comprise our Core Focus Areas.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Legacy Areas - production basins in which we expect our gathering systems to experience relatively lower long-term growth compared to our Core Focus Areas, given that our customers require relatively higher commodity prices to support drilling and completion activities in these basins. Upstream production served by our gathering systems in our Legacy Areas is generally more mature, as compared to our Core Focus Areas, and the decline rates for volume throughput on our gathering systems in the Legacy Areas are typically lower as a result. We expect to continue to moderate our near-term capital expenditures in these Legacy Areas. Our Piceance Basin, Barnett Shale and Marcellus Shale reportable segments (as described below) comprise our Legacy Areas.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are the owner-operator of or have significant ownership interests in the following gathering systems, which comprise our Core Focus Areas:\nTable 233: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Summit Utica, a natural gas gathering system operating in the Appalachian Basin, which includes the Utica and Point Pleasant shale formations in southeastern Ohio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 234: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Ohio Gathering, a natural gas gathering system and a condensate stabilization facility operating in the Appalachian Basin, which includes the Utica and Point Pleasant shale formations in southeastern Ohio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 235: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Polar and Divide, crude oil and produced water gathering systems and transmission pipelines located in the Williston Basin, which includes the Bakken and Three Forks shale formations in northwestern North Dakota;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 236: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Tioga Midstream, a crude oil, produced water and associated natural gas gathering system operating in the Williston Basin, which includes the Bakken and Three Forks shale formations in northwestern North Dakota;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Bison Midstream, an associated natural gas gathering system operating in the Williston Basin, which includes the Bakken and Three Forks shale formations in northwestern North Dakota;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 238: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Niobrara G&P, an associated natural gas gathering and processing system operating in the DJ Basin, which includes the Niobrara and Codell shale formations in northeastern Colorado; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 239: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Summit Permian, an associated natural gas gathering and processing system in the northern Delaware Basin, which includes the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring formations, in southeastern New Mexico.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are the owner-operator of the following gathering systems, which comprise our Legacy Areas:\nTable 240: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Grand River, a natural gas gathering and processing system located in the Piceance Basin, which includes the Mesaverde formation and the Mancos and Niobrara shale formations in western Colorado and eastern Utah;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 241: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> DFW Midstream, a natural gas gathering system operating in the Fort Worth Basin, which includes the Barnett Shale formation in north-central Texas; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 242: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Mountaineer Midstream, a natural gas gathering system operating in the Appalachian Basin, which includes the Marcellus Shale formation in northern West Virginia.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor additional information on our organization and systems, see Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOur financial results are driven primarily by volume throughput and expense management. We generate the majority of our revenues from the gathering, treating and processing services that we provide to our customers. A majority of the volumes that we gather, treat and/or process have a fixed-fee rate structure which enhances the stability of our cash flows by providing a revenue stream that is not subject to direct commodity price risk. We also earn revenues from (i) the sale of physical natural gas and/or NGLs purchased under percentage-of-proceeds arrangements with certain of our customers on the Bison Midstream and Grand River systems, (ii) natural gas and crude oil marketing services in and around our gathering systems, (iii) the sale of natural gas we retain from certain DFW Midstream customers and (iv) the sale of condensate we retain from our gathering services at Grand River. These additional activities, including marketing transactions comprised of buy and sell arrangements, directly expose us to fluctuations in commodity prices and accounted for approximately 27% of total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2018. These additional activities, excluding marketing transactions comprised of buy and sell arrangements, accounted for approximately 11% of total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2018. We expect our natural gas and crude oil marketing services to increase in future periods.\nWe also have indirect exposure to changes in commodity prices in that persistently low commodity prices may cause our customers to delay and/or cancel drilling and/or completion activities or temporarily shut-in production, which would reduce the volumes of natural gas and crude oil (and associated volumes of produced water) that we gather. If certain of our customers cancel or delay drilling and/or completion activities or temporarily shut-in production, the associated MVCs, if any, ensure that we will earn a minimum amount of revenue.\nThe following table presents certain consolidated and reportable segment financial data.

To the extent our underlying assumptions about, or interpretations of, available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.\nNatural gas, NGL and crude oil supply and demand dynamics. Natural gas continues to be a critical component of energy supply and demand in the United States. The average spot price of natural gas increased during 2018 relative to 2017. The average daily Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price was $3.15 per MMBtu during 2018, compared with $2.99 per MMBtu during 2017. Henry Hub closed at $3.19 per MMBtu on December 31, 2018. Despite these modest gains, natural gas prices continue to trade at lower-than-average historical prices due in part to increased natural gas production and the amount of natural gas in storage in the continental United States. In the near term, we believe that until the supply of natural gas in storage has been reduced, natural gas prices are likely to remain constrained. Over the long term, we believe that the prospects for continued natural gas demand are favorable and will be driven primarily by global population and economic growth, as well as the continued displacement of coal-fired electricity generation by natural gas-fired electricity generation.\nIn addition, certain of our gathering systems are directly affected by crude oil supply and demand dynamics. Crude oil prices continued to increase during 2017 and 2018, with the average daily West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\") crude oil spot price increasing from an average $50.80 per barrel during 2017 to an average of $64.95 per barrel during 2018, representing a 28% increase. However, WTI closed at $45.91 per barrel on December 31, 2018 reflecting broader market concerns for global oil supply. In response to the general increase in crude oil prices, the number of active crude oil drilling rigs in the continental United States increased from 747 in December 2017 to 885 in December 2018, according to Baker Hughes. Over the next several years, we expect that crude oil prices will support continued drilling and increasing production in the Williston Basin, Permian Basin and DJ Basin.\nGrowth in production from U.S. shale plays. Over the past several years, natural gas production from unconventional shale resources has increased significantly due to advances in technology that allow producers to extract significant volumes of natural gas from unconventional shale plays on favorable economic terms relative to most conventional plays. In recent years, a number of producers and their joint venture partners, including large international operators, industrial manufacturers and private equity sponsors, have committed significant capital to the development of these unconventional resources, including the Piceance, Barnett, Bakken, Marcellus, Utica and Permian Basin shale plays in which we operate, and we believe that these long-term capital investments will support drilling activity in unconventional shale plays over the long term.\nRate of growth in production from U.S. shale plays. Some of our producer customers have adjusted their drilling and completion activities and schedules to manage drilling and completion costs at levels that are achievable using cash flow generated from the underlying operations. Historically, as part of a strategy to accelerate production growth, these producers would raise capital to fund drilling and completion costs in excess of the cash flows generated from their underlying assets. We expect that certain of our producers will continue to adopt and implement this revised strategy, which will likely result in a slower pace of growth in production across many of our systems relative to management's previous expectations. This dynamic is a significant contributing factor to our revision in the estimated undiscounted value of the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation as of December 31, 2018, relative to our estimate as of December 31, 2016.\nCapital markets availability and cost of capital. Credit markets were volatile throughout 2018, as borrowing costs increased and investors assessed the impact of rising rates on broader economic activity. The Federal Reserve\nraised its benchmark federal-funds rate from a range of 1.25% and 1.50% in December 2017 to a range between 2.25% and 2.50% in December 2018. The Federal Reserve may continue to raise interest rates in the future, to the extent that economic growth continues. Capital markets conditions, including but not limited to availability and higher borrowing costs, could affect our ability to access the debt capital markets to the extent necessary to fund our future growth. Furthermore, market demand for equity issued by master limited partnerships has been significantly lower in recent years than it has been historically, which may make it more challenging for us to finance our expansion capital expenditures and acquisition capital expenditures with the issuance of additional equity. We recently announced a planned reduction in our common unit distribution to $0.2875 per quarter, beginning with the distribution to be paid in respect of the first quarter of 2019, and this reduction may further reduce demand for our common units. In addition, interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly. Although this could limit our ability to raise debt capital on acceptable terms, we expect to remain competitive with respect to acquisitions and capital projects, as our peers and competitors would likely face similar circumstances.\nShifts in operating costs and inflation. Throughout most of the last five years, high levels of crude oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities across the United States resulted in increased competition for personnel and equipment as well as higher prices for labor, supplies, equipment and other services. Beginning in 2015, this dynamic began to shift as prices for crude oil and natural gas-related services decreased in line with overall decline in demand for these goods and services. While we expect lower service-related costs in the near term, we expect that over the longer term, these costs will continue to have a high correlation to changes in the prevailing price of crude oil and natural gas.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nWe conduct and report our operations in the midstream energy industry through eight reportable segments. We evaluate our business operations each reporting period to determine whether any of our operating segments in which we internally report financial information are considered significant and would require us to separately disclose certain segment financial information in our external reporting. As a result of our evaluation, during the fourth quarter of 2018, we determined that the DJ Basin natural gas gathering and processing system, previously reported within the Piceance/DJ Basins reportable segment, is expected to be a significant operating segment in future reporting periods. This determination was based on, among other things, the development of a new 60 MMcf/d processing plant that is expected to be operational in 2019, which will increase volume throughput beginning in 2019. In addition, we determined the Permian Basin natural gas gathering and processing system, which was commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2018, is expected to be a significant operating segment in future reporting periods. As such, we modified our current segments in the fourth quarter of 2018 such that the DJ Basin reportable segment includes the Niobrara G&P system and the Permian Basin reportable segment includes the Summit Permian natural gas gathering and processing system. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we have disclosed the required segment information for Niobrara G&P and Summit Permian and the periods prior have been recast to reflect this change. Our reportable segments are as follows:\nTable 262: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the Utica Shale, which is served by Summit Utica;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 263: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Ohio Gathering, which includes our ownership interest in OGC and OCC;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 264: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the Williston Basin, which is served by Polar and Divide, Tioga Midstream and Bison Midstream;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 265: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the DJ Basin, which is served by Niobrara G&P;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 266: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the Permian Basin, which is served by Summit Permian;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 267: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the Piceance Basin, which is served by Grand River;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 268: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the Barnett Shale, which is served by DFW Midstream; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 269: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the Marcellus Shale, which is served by Mountaineer Midstream.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEach of our reportable segments provides midstream services in a specific geographic area. Our reportable segments reflect the way in which we internally report the financial information used to make decisions and allocate resources in connection with our operations (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operational metrics to analyze our consolidated and segment performance. We view these metrics as important factors in evaluating our profitability and determining the amounts of cash distributions to pay to our unitholders. These metrics include:\nTable 270: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> throughput volume;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 271: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> revenues;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 272: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> operation and maintenance expenses; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 273: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> segment adjusted EBITDA.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThroughput Volume\nThe volume of (i) natural gas that we gather, compress, treat and/or process and (ii) crude oil and produced water that we gather depends on the level of production from natural gas or crude oil wells connected to our gathering systems. Aggregate production volumes are impacted by the overall amount of drilling and completion activity. Furthermore, because the production rate of natural gas and crude oil wells decline over time, production can only be maintained or increased by new drilling or other activity.\nAs a result, we must continually obtain new supplies of production to maintain or increase the throughput volume on our systems. Our ability to maintain or increase throughput volumes from existing customers and obtain new supplies of throughput is impacted by:\nTable 274: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> successful drilling activity within our AMIs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 275: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the level of work-overs and recompletions of wells on existing pad sites to which our gathering systems are connected;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 276: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the number of new pad sites in our AMIs awaiting connections;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 277: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells in the areas in which we operate outside of our existing AMIs; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 278: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to gather, treat and/or process production that has been released from commitments with our competitors.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe report volumes gathered for natural gas in cubic feet per day. We aggregate crude oil and produced water gathering and report volumes gathered in barrels per day.\nRevenues\nOur revenues are primarily attributable to the volumes that we gather, treat and/or process and the rates we charge for those services. A majority of our gathering and processing agreements are fee-based, which limits our direct exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. We also have percent-of-proceeds arrangements under which the gathering and processing revenues that we earn correlate directly with the fluctuating price of natural gas, condensate and NGLs.\nCertain of our gathering and processing agreements contain MVCs pursuant to which our customers agree to ship or process a minimum volume of production on our gathering systems, or, in some cases, to pay a minimum monetary amount, over certain periods during the term of the MVC. These MVCs help us generate stable revenues and serve to mitigate the financial impact associated with declining volumes.\nOperation and Maintenance Expenses\nWe seek to maximize the profitability of our operations in part by minimizing, to the extent appropriate, expenses directly tied to operating our assets. Direct labor costs, compression costs, ad valorem taxes, repair and\nnon-capitalized maintenance costs, integrity management costs, utilities and contract services comprise the most significant portion of our operation and maintenance expense. Other than utilities expense, these expenses are largely independent of volumes delivered through our gathering systems but may fluctuate depending on the activities performed during a specific period.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nSegment adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental financial measure used by management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA is used to assess:\nTable 279: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to make cash distributions and support our indebtedness;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 280: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 281: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy sector, without regard to financing or capital structure;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 282: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the attractiveness of capital projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 283: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the financial performance of our assets without regard to (i) income or loss from equity method investees, (ii) the impact of the timing of minimum volume commitment shortfall payments under our gathering agreements or (iii) the timing of impairments or other noncash income or expense items.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdditional Information. For additional information, see the \"Results of Operations\" section herein and the notes to the consolidated financial statements. For information on pending accounting changes that are expected to materially impact our financial results reported in future periods, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nOur financial results are recognized as follows:\nGathering services and related fees.

The decrease was primarily a result of lower volume throughput in the Williston Basin and Barnett Shale segments.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense decreased $1.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting a decrease in information technology expense of $1.3 million and an increase in capitalized labor of $0.7 million associated with the continued development of Summit Permian and the DJ Basin.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting an increase in salaries and benefits as a result of increased headcount. For additional information, see the \"Corporate and Other Overview of the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016\" sections herein.\nDepreciation and Amortization. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense during 2018 was primarily due to the impairment of certain intangible and long-lived assets on the Bison Midstream system in the Williston Basin segment recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense during 2017 was largely driven by an increase in assets placed into service in the Summit Utica system.\nTransaction Costs. Transaction costs recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily relate to financial and legal advisory costs associated with the 2016 Drop Down.\nInterest Expense. The decrease in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior period, was as a result of (i) the tender and redemption of the $300.0 million principal 7.5% Senior Notes, (ii) the issuance of 300,000 Series A Preferred Units in November 2017 whereby the net proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and (iii) a lower average outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility. The decrease was partially offset by the interest associated with issuance of the $500.0 million principal 5.75% Senior Notes and an increase in the interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior period, was primarily driven by the interest associated with issuance of the $500.0 million principal 5.75% Senior Notes and an increase in the interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility. These increases were partially offset by (i) the tender and redemption of the $300.0 million principal 7.5% Senior Notes, (ii) a lower outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility and (iii) the issuance of 300,000 Series A Preferred Units in November 2017 whereby the net proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nEarly Extinguishment of Debt. The early extinguishment of debt recognized during 2017 was driven by the tender and redemption of the $300.0 million principal 7.5% Senior Notes.\nDeferred Purchase Price Obligation. Deferred Purchase Price Obligation recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018 represents the change in present value of the estimated Remaining Consideration to be paid in connection with the 2016 Drop Down (see Notes 17 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements). The change was primarily due to the passage of time and an associated decrease in the discount rate, partially offset by the continued slowing and deferral of drilling and completion activities to periods outside of the DPPO measurement period.\nIn 2017, we updated the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation based on management's estimate of forecasted Business Adjusted EBITDA and capital expenditures for the 2016 Drop Down Assets. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower expected Business Adjusted EBITDA in 2018 and 2019 associated with the 2016 Drop Down Assets, partially offset by lower estimated capital expenditures. The revision in estimated Business Adjusted EBITDA and estimated capital expenditures reflects a slower expected pace of drilling and completion activities from our customers, particularly in the Utica Shale in 2018 and 2019. As of December 31, 2017, we estimated the undiscounted future value of the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation to be approximately $454.4 million. As a result of revisions in these estimates, the estimated undiscounted future payment obligation decreased by $375.9 million relative to the estimate as of December 31, 2016. The revised estimates had a favorable impact on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Deferred Purchase Price Obligation recognized in 2016 relates to our 2016 Drop Down transaction and the issuance of the Deferred Payment in connection with the 2016 Drop Down (see Notes 2 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements).\nFor additional information, see the \"Segment Overview for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016\" and \"Corporate and Other Overview for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016\" sections herein and Business - Recent Developments.\u201d\nSegment Overview for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016\nUtica Shale.

In addition, the TPL-7 connector project was commissioned in the first quarter of 2017 which partially offset volume declines in 2018 due to a full year of operations.\nVolume throughput increased during 2017 due to the ongoing development of the system and completion of new wells during 2017.

Total revenues attributable to Corporate and Other was due to natural gas, NGL and crude oil marketing services activity (primarily natural gas sales) for the Piceance Basin, DJ Basin, Barnett Shale and Williston Basin segments.\nCost of Natural Gas and NGLs. Cost of natural gas and NGLs attributable to Corporate and Other increased due to natural gas, NGL and crude oil marketing services activity (primarily natural gas sales) for the Piceance Basin, DJ Basin, Barnett Shale and Williston Basin segments.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense decreased during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting reductions in information technology costs.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased $7.6 million compared to prior period as a result of (i) the tender and redemption of the $300.0 million principal 7.5% Senior Notes, (ii) the issuance of 300,000 Series A Preferred Units in November 2017 whereby the net proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and (iii) a lower average outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility. The decrease was partially offset by the interest associated with issuance of the $500.0 million principal 5.75% Senior Notes and an increase in the interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior period, was primarily driven by the interest associated with issuance of the $500.0 million principal 5.75% Senior Notes and an increase in the interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility. These increases were partially offset by (i) the tender and redemption of the $300.0 million principal 7.5% Senior Notes, (ii) a lower outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility and (iii) the issuance of 300,000 Series A Preferred Units in November 2017 whereby the net proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nEarly Extinguishment of Debt. The early extinguishment of debt recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven by the tender and redemption of the $300.0 million principal amount of 7.5% Senior Notes.\nDeferred Purchase Price Obligation. Deferred Purchase Price Obligation recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018 represents the change in present value of the estimated Remaining Consideration to be paid in connection with the 2016 Drop Down (see Notes 17 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements). The change was primarily due to the passage of time and an associated decrease in the discount rate, partially offset by the continued slowing and deferral of drilling and completion activities to periods outside of the DPPO measurement period.\nIn 2017, we updated the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation based on management's estimate of forecasted Business Adjusted EBITDA and capital expenditures for the 2016 Drop Down Assets. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower expected Business Adjusted EBITDA in 2018 and 2019 associated with the 2016 Drop Down Assets partially offset by lower estimated capital expenditures. The revision in estimated Business Adjusted EBITDA and estimated capital expenditures reflects a slower expected pace of drilling and completion activities from our customers, particularly in the Utica Shale in 2018 and 2019. As of December 31, 2017, we estimated the undiscounted future value of the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation to be approximately $454.4 million. As a result of revisions in these estimates, the estimated undiscounted future payment obligation decreased by $375.9 million relative to the estimate as of December 31, 2016. The revised estimates had a favorable impact on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 (see Notes 2 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements).\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nBased on the terms of our Partnership Agreement, we expect that we will distribute to our unitholders most of the cash generated by our operations. As a result, we expect to fund future capital expenditures from cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flows generated from our operations, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and future issuances of equity and debt instruments.\nCapital Markets Activity\nJuly 2017 Shelf Registration Statement. In July 2017, we filed the 2017 SRS with the SEC to issue an indeterminate amount of debt, equity securities and guarantees. In November 2017, we filed a post-effective amendment to the 2017 SRS with the SEC to register, in addition to the classes of securities originally registered, an indeterminate amount of preferred units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. The 2017 SRS expires in July 2020.

Our General Partner made capital contributions to maintain its approximate 2% General Partner interest in SMLP. Following the effectiveness of the new ATM registration statement and after taking into account the aggregate sales price of common units sold under the ATM Program through December 31, 2018, we have the capacity to issue additional common units under the ATM Program up to an aggregate $132.3 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFollowing the February 2017 secondary offering, we can issue up to $1.50 billion of debt and equity securities in primary offerings and a total of 32,701,230 common units held by (i) a subsidiary of Summit Investments and (ii) affiliates of our Sponsor pursuant to the 2016 SRS. The 2016 SRS expires in November 2019.\nJuly 2014 Shelf Registration Statement. In July 2014, we filed the 2014 SRS with the SEC to issue an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities and shortly thereafter completed a public offering of $300.0 million aggregate principal 5.5% senior unsecured notes due 2022. We used the proceeds to repay a portion of the then-outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nOn February 8, 2017, we amended the 2014 SRS to include additional guarantor subsidiaries and completed a public offering of $500.0 million principal 5.75% senior unsecured notes due 2025. Concurrent therewith, we made a tender offer to purchase all the outstanding 7.5% Senior Notes. The tender offer expired on February 14, 2017 with $276.9 million validly tendered. On February 16, 2017, we issued a notice of redemption for the 7.5% Senior Notes that remained outstanding subsequent to the tender offer. The remaining 7.5% Senior Notes were redeemed on March 18, 2017, with payment made on March 20, 2017. We used the proceeds from the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes to (i) fund the repurchase of the outstanding $300.0 million principal 7.5% Senior Notes, (ii) pay redemption and call premiums on the 7.5% Senior Notes totaling $17.9 million and (iii) pay $172.0 million of the balance outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nFor additional information, see Notes 10 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements.\nDebt\nRevolving Credit Facility.

As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding balance of the Revolving Credit Facility was $466.0 million and the unused portion totaled $784.0 million. There were no defaults or events of default during 2018, and as of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the financial covenants in the Revolving Credit Facility.\nSenior Notes. In June 2013, the Co-Issuers co-issued the 7.5% Senior Notes, and in July 2014, the Co-Issuers co-issued the 5.5% Senior Notes. In February 2017, the Co-Issuers co-issued the 5.75% Senior Notes.

Properties and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, we borrowed $360.0 million under our Revolving Credit Facility and recognized a liability of $507.4 million for the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation, both in connection with the 2016 Drop Down. The Deferred Purchase Price Obligation is due no later than December 31, 2020 and as of December 31, 2018, was expected to be $423.9 million based on information available as of December 31, 2018. Upon consummation of the Amendment and the $100 million prepayment of the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation, the Remaining Consideration under the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation will be reduced to $303.5 million, which will be payable by the Partnership in one or more payments over the period from March 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, payable in (i) cash, (ii) the Partnership's common units or (iii) a combination of cash and the Partnership's common units, at the discretion of the Partnership. No less than 50% of the Remaining Consideration shall be paid on or before June 30, 2020 and interest shall accrue at a rate of 8% per annum on any portion of the Remaining Consideration that remains unpaid after March 31, 2020. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.\nIn February 2017, we issued $500.0 million principal of 5.75% senior, unsecured notes due 2025. We used the proceeds from the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes to (i) fund the repurchase of the outstanding $300.0 million principal 7.5% Senior Notes, (ii) pay redemption and call premiums on the 7.5% Senior Notes totaling $17.9 million and (iii) pay $172.0 million of the balance outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nCapital Requirements\nOur ability to grow, or even maintain current, cash distributions depends, in part, on our ability to capitalize on organic growth opportunities and make acquisitions that increase the amount of cash generated from our operations on a per-unit basis, along with other factors.\nDeveloping, owning and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets requires significant investment in the maintenance of existing gathering systems and the construction and development of new gathering systems and other midstream assets and facilities.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, cash paid for capital expenditures totaled $200.6 million, compared with $124.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $142.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Maintenance capital expenditures totaled $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with $15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2018, contributions to equity method investees totaled $4.9 million, compared with $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). The year-over-year increase in cash paid for capital expenditures primarily reflected the expansion of our existing gathering and processing complex in the DJ Basin with the addition of a new 60 MMcf/d cryogenic processing plant in addition to the development of our new associated natural gas gathering and processing system in the Permian Basin.\nThe acquisition component and greenfield development projects of our growth strategy has required and will continue to require significant expenditures by us. Consequently, our ability to develop and maintain sources of funds to meet our capital requirements is critical to our ability to meet our growth objectives. We intend to continue to pursue accretive acquisitions of midstream assets from third parties. However, their size, timing and/or contribution to our operations and financial results cannot be reasonably estimated. Furthermore, there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our current expectations to change, including, but not limited to, (i) the ability to reach agreement with third parties; (ii) prevailing conditions and outlook in the natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids industries and markets and (iii) our ability to obtain financing from commercial banks, the capital markets, or other sources such as our Sponsor and Summit Investments, among other factors.\nWe rely primarily on internally generated cash flow as well as external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt, equity and preferred equity securities, to fund our capital expenditures. We believe that our Revolving Credit Facility, together with internally generated cash flow and financial support from our Sponsor and/or access to new debt or equity capital markets, will be adequate to finance our growth objectives for the foreseeable future without adversely impacting our liquidity or our ability to make quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders.\nCredit and Counterparty Concentration Risks\nWe examine the creditworthiness of counterparties to whom we extend credit and manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, credit approval, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and for certain transactions, we may request letters of credit, prepayments or guarantees.\nCertain of our customers may be temporarily unable to meet their current obligations. While this may cause disruption to cash flows, we believe that we are properly positioned to deal with the potential disruption because the vast majority of our gathering assets are strategically positioned at the beginning of the midstream value chain. The majority of our infrastructure is connected directly to our customers' wellheads and pad sites, which means our gathering systems are typically the first third-party infrastructure through which our customers' commodities flow and, in many cases, the only way for our customers to get their production to market.\nWe have exposure due to nonperformance under our MVC contracts whereby a customer, who was not meeting its MVCs, does not have the wherewithal to make its MVC shortfall payments when they become due. We typically receive payment for all prior-year MVC shortfall billings in the quarter immediately following billing. Therefore, our exposure to risk of nonperformance is limited to and accumulates during the current year-to-date contracted measurement period.\nFor additional information, see Notes 4, 9 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of or during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These principles are established by the FASB. We employ methods, estimates and assumptions based on currently available information when recording transactions resulting from business operations. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe estimates that we deem to be most critical to an understanding of our financial position and results of operations are those related to determination of fair value and recognition of deferred revenue. The preparation and evaluation of these critical accounting estimates involve the use of various assumptions developed from management's analyses and judgments. Subsequent experience or use of other methods, estimates or assumptions could produce significantly different results. Our critical accounting estimates are as follows:\nRecognition and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, amortizing intangible assets and goodwill.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Amortizing Intangible Assets. As of December 31, 2018, we had net property, plant and equipment with a carrying value of approximately $2.0 billion and net amortizing intangible assets with a carrying value of approximately $273.4 million.\nWhen evidence exists that we will not be able to recover a long-lived asset's carrying value through future cash flows, we write down the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value. We test assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable as well as in connection with any goodwill impairment evaluations.\nWith respect to property, plant and equipment and our amortizing intangible assets, the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if the carrying value exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the asset's use and eventual disposal. In this situation, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the asset's fair value. We determine fair value using an income-based approach in which we discount the asset's expected future cash flows to reflect the risk associated with achieving the underlying cash flows. Any impairment determinations involve significant assumptions and judgments. Differing assumptions regarding any of these inputs could have a significant effect on the various valuations. As such, the fair value measurements utilized within these estimates are classified as non-recurring Level 3 measurements in the fair value hierarchy because they are not observable from objective sources. Due to the volatility of the inputs used, we cannot predict the likelihood of any future impairment.\n2018 Impairments. In December 2018, in connection with certain strategic initiatives, we performed a recoverability assessment of certain assets within the Williston Basin reporting segment. Based on the results, we concluded that the carrying value of certain long-lived assets related to the Tioga Midstream system within the Williston Basin were not fully recoverable. We recorded an impairment charge of $3.9 million related to these assets after comparing the fair value of the long-lived assets to their carrying values. In addition, we reviewed other assets that had been identified as potentially impaired and recognized long-lived asset impairments as detailed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.\n2017 Impairments. In December 2017, in connection with certain strategic initiatives, we performed a financial review of certain assets within the Williston Basin reporting segment. This resulted in a triggering event that required us to perform a recoverability test. Based on the results of the test, we concluded that the carrying value of certain long-lived assets and the related intangible assets related to the Bison Midstream system in the Williston Basin were not fully recoverable. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $101.9 million related to the long-lived assets and $85.2 million related to contract intangibles assets.\nFor additional information, see Notes 2, 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually on September 30 and whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill.\n2018, 2017 and 2016 Impairment Evaluations. We performed our 2018, 2017 and 2016 annual goodwill impairment analysis as of September 30 and concluded that none of our goodwill had been impaired.\nSee Notes 2 and 7 for additional information.\nDeferred Purchase Price Obligation\nWe recognized the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation to reflect the present value of the Remaining Consideration. Our calculation of the Remaining Consideration incorporates:\nTable 400: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> actual capital expenditures and Business Adjusted EBITDA related to the 2016 Drop Down Assets for the period from March 3, 2016 through the respective balance sheet date; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 401: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> estimates of (i) capital expenditures made between the respective balance sheet date and December 31, 2019 and (ii) Business Adjusted EBITDA, an income-based measure, during the period from the respective balance sheet date to December 31, 2019. The calculation of the prospective component of Remaining Consideration represents management's best estimate of these two financial measures.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe then discount the Remaining Consideration using a commensurate risk-adjusted discount rate and recognize the present value on our consolidated balance sheets with the change in present value recognized in earnings in the period of change.\nThe estimates and expectations used in calculating the prospective component of Remaining Consideration and the present value calculation of the Remaining Consideration involve a significant amount of judgment as the calculations are, in part, based on future events and/or conditions, including (i) revenues, (ii) estimates of future volume throughput, capital expenditures, operating costs and their timing and (iii) economic and regulatory climates, among other factors. Our estimates of these inputs are inherently imprecise because they reflect our expectation of future conditions that are largely outside of our control. While the assumptions used are consistent with our current business plans and investment decisions, these assumptions could change significantly during the period leading up to settlement of the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation. See Notes 17 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements and Business - Recent Developments\u201d for additional information.\nMinimum Volume Commitments\nDeferred Revenue. We record customer billings for obligations under their MVCs as deferred revenue when the customer has the right to utilize shortfall payments to offset gathering or processing fees in subsequent periods. We recognize deferred revenue under these arrangements in revenue when (i) we consider it remote that the customer will utilize shortfall payments to offset gathering or processing fees in excess of its MVCs in subsequent periods; (ii) the customer incurs a shortfall in a contract with no banking mechanism or claw back provision; (iii) the customer's banking mechanism has expired; or (iv) it is remote that the customer will use its unexercised right. We also recognize deferred revenue when it is determined that a given amount of MVC shortfall payments cannot be recovered by offsetting gathering or processing fees in subsequent contracted measurement periods. In making this determination, we consider both quantitative and qualitative facts and circumstances, including, but not limited to, contract terms, capacity of the associated pipeline or receipt point and/or expectations regarding future investment, drilling and production.\nWe classify deferred revenue as a current liability for arrangements where the expiration of a customer's right to utilize shortfall payments is twelve months or less. We classify deferred revenue as noncurrent for arrangements where the expiration of the right to utilize shortfall payments and our estimate of its potential utilization is more than 12 months. As of December 31, 2018, current deferred revenue totaled $11.5 million. Noncurrent deferred revenue totaled $39.5\nmillion at December 31, 2018 and represents amounts that provide these customers the ability to offset their gathering fees, as determined by the MVC contract, to the extent that their throughput volumes exceed their MVC.\nAdjustments for MVC Shortfall Payments. We estimate the impact of expected MVC shortfall payments for inclusion in our calculation of segment adjusted EBITDA. Adjustments related to MVC shortfall payments account for:\nTable 402: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the net increases or decreases in deferred revenue for MVC shortfall payments and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 403: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our inclusion of expected annual or multi-year MVC shortfall payments. With respect to the impact of a net change in deferred revenue for MVC shortfall payments, we treated increases in deferred revenue balances as a favorable adjustment to segment adjusted EBITDA, while decreases in deferred revenue balances were treated as an unfavorable adjustment to segment adjusted EBITDA. We also included a proportional amount of any historical and expected MVC shortfall payments in each quarter prior to the quarter in which we actually recognized the shortfall payment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe estimate expected MVC shortfall payments based on assumptions including, but not limited to, contract terms, historical volume throughput data and expectations regarding future investment, drilling and production.\nFor additional information, see Notes 2, 4 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements and the \"Results of Operations\" and \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Credit and Counterparty Concentration Risks\" sections herein.\nForward-Looking Statements\nInvestors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this report as well as in periodic press releases and certain oral statements made by our officers and employees during our presentations are forward-looking\u201d statements.

Some of our producer customers have adjusted their drilling and completion activities and schedules to manage drilling and completion costs at levels that are achievable using cash flow generated from the underlying operations. Historically, as part of a strategy to accelerate production growth, these producers would raise capital to fund drilling and completion costs in excess of the cash flows generated from their underlying assets. We expect that certain of our producers will continue to adopt and implement this revised strategy, which will likely result in a slower pace of growth in production across many of our systems relative to management's previous expectations.

Natural gas continues to be a critical component of energy supply and demand in the United States. The average spot price of natural gas increased during 2018 relative to 2017. The average daily Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price was $3.15 per MMBtu during 2018, compared with $2.99 per MMBtu during 2017. Henry Hub closed at $3.19 per MMBtu on December 31, 2018. Despite these modest gains, natural gas prices continue to trade at lower-than-average historical prices due in part to increased natural gas production and the amount of natural gas in storage in the continental United States. In the near term, we believe that until the supply of natural gas in storage has been reduced, natural gas prices are likely to remain constrained. Over the long term, we believe that the prospects for continued natural gas demand are favorable and will be driven primarily by global population and economic growth, as well as the continued displacement of coal-fired electricity generation by natural gas-fired electricity generation.\nIn March 2016, we entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of Summit Investments to fund a portion of the 2016 Drop Down whereby we have recognized the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements and Business - Recent Developments\u201d).\n \u2022 Ohio Gathering, a natural gas gathering system and a condensate stabilization facility operating in the Appalachian Basin, which includes the Utica and Point Pleasant shale formations in southeastern Ohio; \nFor additional information, see Notes 10 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 an increase in gathering services and related fees primarily as a result of volume growth from ongoing drilling and completion activity. \nVolume throughput for the Marcellus Shale reportable segment follows.\n \u2022 In the fourth quarter of 2017, we impaired certain long-lived assets and contract intangible assets relating to the Bison Midstream system in the Williston Basin (see Notes 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements). These impairments had no impact on segment adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017. \n\n \u2022 the net increases or decreases in deferred revenue for MVC shortfall payments and \nCredit and Counterparty Concentration Risks\nShifts in operating costs and inflation. Throughout most of the last five years, high levels of crude oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities across the United States resulted in increased competition for personnel and equipment as well as higher prices for labor, supplies, equipment and other services. Beginning in 2015, this dynamic began to shift as prices for crude oil and natural gas-related services decreased in line with overall decline in demand for these goods and services. While we expect lower service-related costs in the near term, we expect that over the longer term, these costs will continue to have a high correlation to changes in the prevailing price of crude oil and natural gas.\n\n \u2022 weather conditions and terrain in certain areas in which we operate; \n \u2022 changes in general economic conditions; and \n \u2022 successful drilling activity within our AMIs; \n \u2022 the impact of the 2017 recognition of $37.7 million of previously deferred revenue related to a certain Williston Basin customer. \n \u2022 the number of new pad sites in our AMIs awaiting connections; \n \u2022 changes in the availability and cost of capital and the results of our financing efforts, including availability of funds in the credit and/or equity capital markets; \nVolume throughput increased during 2017, compared to the prior period, despite the continued suspended drilling activities by one of Grand River's key customers, primarily as a result of ongoing drilling and completion activity by other customers across our gathering footprint.\n(4) See Item 2. Properties and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.\nTransaction Costs. Transaction costs recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily relate to financial and legal advisory costs associated with the 2016 Drop Down.\nCash flows provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily reflected:\n \u2022 Polar and Divide, crude oil and produced water gathering systems and transmission pipelines located in the Williston Basin, which includes the Bakken and Three Forks shale formations in northwestern North Dakota; \nYear ended December 31, 2018. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $0.4 million during 2017, compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting:\nFinancial data for our Marcellus Shale reportable segment follows.\n \u2022 In November 2017, we issued 300,000 9.50% Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership at a price to the public of $1,000 per unit. We used the net proceeds of $293.2 million (after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses) to repay outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. \n \u2022 Overview \nBarnett Shale. The DFW Midstream system provides our midstream services for the Barnett Shale reportable segment.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\n(1) Early extinguishment of debt includes $17.9 million paid for redemption and call premiums, as well as $4.1 million of unamortized debt issuance costs which were written off in connection with the repurchase of the outstanding $300.0 million 7.5% Senior Notes in the first quarter of 2017.\n \u2022 a $6.0 million increase from the recognition of MVC shortfall adjustments for the Barnett Shale segment under Topic 606 (see Note 3 in the consolidated financial statements). \n \u2022 In March 2016, we acquired the 2016 Drop Down Assets from a subsidiary of Summit Investments. We funded the drop down with borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and the execution of the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation with Summit Investments (see Notes 12 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements). \nEarly Extinguishment of Debt. The early extinguishment of debt recognized during 2017 was driven by the tender and redemption of the $300.0 million principal 7.5% Senior Notes.\n \u2022 the effects of existing and future laws and governmental regulations, including environmental, safety and climate change requirements; \nOther income or expense. Generally represents other items of gain or loss but may also include interest income.\nCosts and Expenses. Total costs and expenses decreased $138.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting:\nDeferred Purchase Price Obligation. Deferred Purchase Price Obligation recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018 represents the change in present value of the estimated Remaining Consideration to be paid in connection with the 2016 Drop Down (see Notes 17 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements). The change was primarily due to the passage of time and an associated decrease in the discount rate, partially offset by the continued slowing and deferral of drilling and completion activities to periods outside of the DPPO measurement period.\nGathering Services and Related Fees. Gathering services and related fees decreased $49.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting:\nDepreciation and amortization. The depreciation of our property, plant and equipment and the amortization of our contract and right-of-way intangible assets.\nYear ended December 31, 2018. Segment adjusted EBITDA decreased $3.0 million during 2018, compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting:\nVolume throughput decreased during 2018, compared to the prior period, as a result of natural production declines, partially offset by drilling and completion activity that occurred across our service area during the second half of 2017 and through the third quarter of 2018.\n \u2022 a decrease in liquids volumes and a $3.3 million reduction in MVC shortfall payments, partially offset by $2.6 million of business interruption recoveries and the recognition of $1.6 million in gathering services and related fees relating to previously billed but unearned revenue in the second quarter of 2017. \n \u2022 DFW Midstream, a natural gas gathering system operating in the Fort Worth Basin, which includes the Barnett Shale formation in north-central Texas; and \nFor additional information, see Notes 2, 4 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements and the \"Results of Operations\" and \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Credit and Counterparty Concentration Risks\" sections herein.\nOn February 8, 2017, we amended the 2014 SRS to include additional guarantor subsidiaries and completed a public offering of $500.0 million principal 5.75% senior unsecured notes due 2025. Concurrent therewith, we made a tender offer to purchase all the outstanding 7.5% Senior Notes. The tender offer expired on February 14, 2017 with $276.9 million validly tendered. On February 16, 2017, we issued a notice of redemption for the 7.5% Senior Notes that remained outstanding subsequent to the tender offer. The remaining 7.5% Senior Notes were redeemed on March 18, 2017, with payment made on March 20, 2017. We used the proceeds from the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes to (i) fund the repurchase of the outstanding $300.0 million principal 7.5% Senior Notes, (ii) pay redemption and call premiums on the 7.5% Senior Notes totaling $17.9 million and (iii) pay $172.0 million of the balance outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nYear ended December 31, 2017. Segment adjusted EBITDA for equity method investees decreased $4.4 million during 2017, compared to the prior period, primarily due to natural production declines and decreased drilling and completion activity, partially offset by increased volumes associated with the installation of additional compression in the dry gas window beginning in March 2017.\nCash flows used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily reflected:\n \u2022 an increase in gathering services and related fees primarily as a result of volume growth from ongoing drilling and completion activity. \n \u2022 the ability to attract and retain key management personnel; \n \u2022 the Piceance Basin, which is served by Grand River; \n \u2022 $200.6 million of capital expenditures primarily attributable to the ongoing development of the Permian Basin of $83.8 million as well as the continued development in the DJ Basin of $64.9 million, and the Williston Basin of $25.2 million; \nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of or during the year ended December 31, 2018.\n \u2022 $124.2 million of capital expenditures primarily attributable to the ongoing development of the Summit Permian and Summit Utica systems as well as the continued development in the Williston Basin, Piceance Basin and DJ Basin segments; and \nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense decreased $1.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting a decrease in information technology expense of $1.3 million and an increase in capitalized labor of $0.7 million associated with the continued development of Summit Permian and the DJ Basin.\nCapital Markets Activity\n \u2022 $142.7 million of capital expenditures primarily attributable to the ongoing expansion of the 2016 Drop Down Assets and the Polar and Divide system; and \nYear ended December 31, 2017. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $5.6 million during 2017, compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting:\nWe are a growth-oriented limited partnership focused on developing, owning and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets that are strategically located in the core producing areas of unconventional resource basins, primarily shale formations, in the continental United States.\n(1) For the purpose of calculating future interest on the Revolving Credit Facility, assumes no change in balance or rate from December 31, 2018.

Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that may project, indicate or imply future results, events, performance or achievements and may contain the words expect,\u201d intend,\u201d plan,\u201d anticipate,\u201d estimate,\u201d believe,\u201d will be,\u201d will continue,\u201d will likely result,\u201d and similar expressions, or future conditional verbs such as may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d would,\u201d and could.\u201d In addition, any statement concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects, and possible actions taken by us, our subsidiaries, Summit Investments or our Sponsor, are also forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors included in this report.\nBased on the terms of our Partnership Agreement, we expect that we will distribute to our unitholders most of the cash generated by our operations. As a result, we expect to fund future capital expenditures from cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flows generated from our operations, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and future issuances of equity and debt instruments.\n \u2022 $387.0 million of net repayments under our Revolving Credit Facility; \n \u2022 a $6.0 million increase from the recognition of MVC shortfall adjustments for the Barnett Shale segment under Topic 606 (see Note 3 in the consolidated financial statements). \n \u2022 a $2.3 million increase, after taking into account the adjustments related to MVC shortfall payments and adjustments related to capital reimbursement activity, in gathering services and related fees primarily as a result of the drilling and completion activity that occurred across our service area by other customers during the second half of 2017 and through the third quarter of 2018, and a $1.0 million MVC shortfall payment received from a customer in 2018 that did not occur in 2017, partially offset by natural production declines. \nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased $7.6 million compared to prior period as a result of (i) the tender and redemption of the $300.0 million principal 7.5% Senior Notes, (ii) the issuance of 300,000 Series A Preferred Units in November 2017 whereby the net proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and (iii) a lower average outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility. The decrease was partially offset by the interest associated with issuance of the $500.0 million principal 5.75% Senior Notes and an increase in the interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility.\n \u2022 a $9.6 million increase in cost of natural gas and NGLs primarily for the Williston Basin segment due to the impact of increasing commodity prices on the percent-of-proceeds activity for the Bison Midstream system. \n \u2022 natural disasters, accidents, weather-related delays, casualty losses and other matters beyond our control; \nSegment adjusted EBITDA is used to assess:\n \u2022 Natural gas, NGL and crude oil supply and demand dynamics; \n* Not considered meaningful\n \u2022 the DJ Basin, which is served by Niobrara G&P; \n \u2022 a $10.9 million purchase of a noncontrolling interest; and \nmillion at December 31, 2018 and represents amounts that provide these customers the ability to offset their gathering fees, as determined by the MVC contract, to the extent that their throughput volumes exceed their MVC.\nGrowth in production from U.S. shale plays. Over the past several years, natural gas production from unconventional shale resources has increased significantly due to advances in technology that allow producers to extract significant volumes of natural gas from unconventional shale plays on favorable economic terms relative to most conventional plays. In recent years, a number of producers and their joint venture partners, including large international operators, industrial manufacturers and private equity sponsors, have committed significant capital to the development of these unconventional resources, including the Piceance, Barnett, Bakken, Marcellus, Utica and Permian Basin shale plays in which we operate, and we believe that these long-term capital investments will support drilling activity in unconventional shale plays over the long term.\n \u2022 an $8.3 million decrease for the Barnett Shale segment largely as a result of natural production declines and reduced drilling activity on the DFW Midstream system. \nThroughput Volume\nThe decrease in liquids volume throughput during 2017 primarily reflected natural production declines and decreased drilling and completion activity.\nYear ended December 31, 2018. Segment adjusted EBITDA decreased $0.1 million during 2018, compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting:\nFor additional information, see Notes 2, 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operational metrics to analyze our consolidated and segment performance. We view these metrics as important factors in evaluating our profitability and determining the amounts of cash distributions to pay to our unitholders. These metrics include:\nWe seek to maximize the profitability of our operations in part by minimizing, to the extent appropriate, expenses directly tied to operating our assets. Direct labor costs, compression costs, ad valorem taxes, repair and\nOther revenues. Revenue earned primarily from (i) certain costs for which certain of our customers have agreed to reimburse us and (ii) connection fees for customers of the Polar and Divide system.\nWe report volumes gathered for natural gas in cubic feet per day. We aggregate crude oil and produced water gathering and report volumes gathered in barrels per day.\nVolumes - Liquids. Crude oil and produced water throughput volumes at the Williston segment increased 19.7 Mbbl/d during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting well completion activity behind our Polar and Divide system in the second half of 2017 and in 2018 as well as the addition of new customers in 2017 and 2018.\n \u2022 Legacy Areas - production basins in which we expect our gathering systems to experience relatively lower long-term growth compared to our Core Focus Areas, given that our customers require relatively higher commodity prices to support drilling and completion activities in these basins. Upstream production served by our gathering systems in our Legacy Areas is generally more mature, as compared to our Core Focus Areas, and the decline rates for volume throughput on our gathering systems in the Legacy Areas are typically lower as a result. We expect to continue to moderate our near-term capital expenditures in these Legacy Areas. Our Piceance Basin, Barnett Shale and Marcellus Shale reportable segments (as described below) comprise our Legacy Areas. \nOther items to note:\nThe following transaction was executed pursuant thereto:\n \u2022 Grand River, a natural gas gathering and processing system located in the Piceance Basin, which includes the Mesaverde formation and the Mancos and Niobrara shale formations in western Colorado and eastern Utah; \n\nGathering services and related fees. Revenue earned from the gathering, compression, treating and processing services that we provide to our customers.\n \u2022 Shifts in operating costs and inflation. \nGeneral and administrative expense increased $2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting an increase in salaries and benefits as a result of increased headcount. For additional information, see the \"Corporate and Other Overview of the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016\" sections herein.\n \u2022 the Utica Shale, which is served by Summit Utica; \n \u2022 the Barnett Shale, which is served by DFW Midstream; and \n \u2022 a $63.7 million increase in natural gas, NGLs and condensate purchases primarily driven by increased natural gas, NGL and crude oil marketing activity for the Piceance Basin, DJ Basin, Barnett Shale and Williston Basin segments. \n\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\n \u2022 In March 2017, we recognized $37.7 million of gathering services and related fees revenue that had been previously deferred, and recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred revenue, in connection with an MVC arrangement with a certain Williston Basin customer, for which we determined we had no further performance obligations. We include the effect of adjustments related to MVC shortfall payments in our definition of segment adjusted EBITDA. As such, the Williston Basin segment adjusted EBITDA was not impacted because the revenue recognition was offset by the associated adjustments related to MVC shortfall payments for this customer. \nOther items to note:\n \u2022 the attractiveness of capital projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities; and \n \u2022 $25.5 million of capital contributions to Ohio Gathering. \nSee Notes 2 and 7 for additional information.\n \u2022 a $2.2 million increase in operation and maintenance expense primarily due to the increase in rights-of-way maintenance, the addition of leasing compression services and increase in direct labor costs. \nThe foregoing list of risks and uncertainties may not contain all of the risks and uncertainties that could affect us. In addition, in light of these risks and uncertainties, the matters referred to in the forward-looking statements contained in this document may not in fact occur. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on these statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law.\n \u2022 $4.9 million of capital contributions to Ohio Gathering. \nAs a result, we must continually obtain new supplies of production to maintain or increase the throughput volume on our systems. Our ability to maintain or increase throughput volumes from existing customers and obtain new supplies of throughput is impacted by:\nYear ended December 31, 2017. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $4.7 million during 2017, compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting:\nDeferred Purchase Price Obligation. Represents the change in fair value associated with the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation.\nCertain of our gathering and processing agreements contain MVCs pursuant to which our customers agree to ship or process a minimum volume of production on our gathering systems, or, in some cases, to pay a minimum monetary amount, over certain periods during the term of the MVC. These MVCs help us generate stable revenues and serve to mitigate the financial impact associated with declining volumes.\nVolume throughput decreased during 2018 due to natural declines from existing wells on pad sites connected to the Summit Utica system together with temporary production curtailments associated with infill drilling and completion activity from customers on existing pad sites, partially offset by the completion of new wells during 2017 and in 2018. In addition, the TPL-7 connector project was commissioned in the first quarter of 2017 which partially offset volume declines in 2018 due to a full year of operations.\nThe Deferred Purchase Price Obligation recognized in 2016 relates to our 2016 Drop Down transaction and the issuance of the Deferred Payment in connection with the 2016 Drop Down (see Notes 2 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements).\n \u2022 a $1.7 million decrease in operation and maintenance expense primarily from $1.3 million of lower electricity expenses associated with lower volume throughput and a decrease in tax expenses. \n \u2022 Production from U.S. shale plays; \nThe table below summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018.\nThe estimates that we deem to be most critical to an understanding of our financial position and results of operations are those related to determination of fair value and recognition of deferred revenue. The preparation and evaluation of these critical accounting estimates involve the use of various assumptions developed from management's analyses and judgments. Subsequent experience or use of other methods, estimates or assumptions could produce significantly different results. Our critical accounting estimates are as follows:\n \u2022 actions or inactions taken or nonperformance by third parties, including suppliers, contractors, operators, processors, transporters and customers, including the inability or failure of our shipper customers to meet their financial obligations under our gathering agreements and our ability to enforce the terms and conditions of certain of our gathering agreements in the event of a bankruptcy of one or more of our customers; \nVolume throughput for the Ohio Gathering system in 2018 increased slightly over the prior period as a result of increased drilling activity from our customers during the second half of 2017 and in 2018, partially offset by natural production declines on existing wells on the system.\n \u2022 In November 2018, a subsidiary of SMLP purchased the remaining 1% ownership interest in OpCo held by a subsidiary of Summit Investments for approximately $10.9 million. As a result of this transaction, other than our investment in Ohio Gathering, all of our business activities are now conducted through wholly owned operating subsidiaries. \n \u2022 a $14.6 million increase for the Utica Shale segment due to the ongoing development of the Summit Utica system, including the commissioning of the TPL-7 connector project in late March 2017. \nOverview\n \u2022 The decrease in the cost of natural gas and NGLs includes a $13.3 million reduction in expense due to the reclassification of amounts under certain percent-of-proceeds arrangements previously recognized in gathering services and related fees under Topic 606 (see Note 3 in the consolidated financial statements). \nCapital markets availability and cost of capital. Credit markets were volatile throughout 2018, as borrowing costs increased and investors assessed the impact of rising rates on broader economic activity. The Federal Reserve\nYear ended December 31, 2016. The following items are reflected in our financial results:\nCrude oil and produced water throughput volumes at the Williston segment decreased 13.7 Mbbl/d during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting natural production declines and decreased drilling and completion activity.\nPiceance Basin. The Grand River system provides midstream services for the Piceance Basin reportable segment. Volume throughput for our Piceance Basin reportable segment follows.\nConsolidated Overview for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016\nDeferred Purchase Price Obligation. Deferred Purchase Price Obligation recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018 represents the change in present value of the estimated Remaining Consideration to be paid in connection with the 2016 Drop Down (see Notes 17 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements). The change was primarily due to the passage of time and an associated decrease in the discount rate, partially offset by the continued slowing and deferral of drilling and completion activities to periods outside of the DPPO measurement period.\n \u2022 a $3.8 million increase in operation and maintenance expense primarily due to planned compressor overhaul maintenance costs during the period. \n \u2022 a $6.8 million decrease in cash interest payments due to the extinguishment of the 7.5% Senior Notes in the first quarter of 2017; \n \u2022 a $10.6 million decrease for the Barnett Shale segment largely as a result of natural production declines and reduced drilling activity on the DFW Midstream system. \nThe increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior period, was primarily driven by the interest associated with issuance of the $500.0 million principal 5.75% Senior Notes and an increase in the interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility. These increases were partially offset by (i) the tender and redemption of the $300.0 million principal 7.5% Senior Notes, (ii) a lower outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility and (iii) the issuance of 300,000 Series A Preferred Units in November 2017 whereby the net proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nOur ability to grow, or even maintain current, cash distributions depends, in part, on our ability to capitalize on organic growth opportunities and make acquisitions that increase the amount of cash generated from our operations on a per-unit basis, along with other factors.\n \u2022 the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; \n \u2022 a $3.6 million decrease in gathering services and related fees for the Barnett Shale segment largely as a result of the expiration of an MVC during 2017. \n \u2022 a volume throughput decrease of 14 MMcf/d for the Barnett Shale segment. \n \u2022 Forward-Looking Statements \nCash flows used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily reflected:\nResults of Operations\n \u2022 a $9.5 million decrease for the Williston Basin segment primarily due to natural production declines and reduced drilling and completion activity on the Polar and Divide system. \n \u2022 estimates of (i) capital expenditures made between the respective balance sheet date and December 31, 2019 and (ii) Business Adjusted EBITDA, an income-based measure, during the period from the respective balance sheet date to December 31, 2019. The calculation of the prospective component of Remaining Consideration represents management's best estimate of these two financial measures. \nWe estimate expected MVC shortfall payments based on assumptions including, but not limited to, contract terms, historical volume throughput data and expectations regarding future investment, drilling and production.\n \u2022 $125.2 million of net proceeds from the issuance of common units in September 2016. \nIncome or loss from equity method investees. Represents the income or loss associated with our ownership interest in Ohio Gathering.\n \u2022 increase of cash receipts due to higher revenues and associated customer payments; \n(4) Reflects proceeds from the issuance of Series A preferred units.\n \u2022 restrictions placed on us by the agreements governing our debt and preferred equity instruments; \n*Not considered meaningful\n2018, 2017 and 2016 Impairment Evaluations. We performed our 2018, 2017 and 2016 annual goodwill impairment analysis as of September 30 and concluded that none of our goodwill had been impaired.\n \u2022 a volume throughput decrease of 28 MMcf/d for the Marcellus Shale segment. \nDebt\nJuly 2014 Shelf Registration Statement. In July 2014, we filed the 2014 SRS with the SEC to issue an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities and shortly thereafter completed a public offering of $300.0 million aggregate principal 5.5% senior unsecured notes due 2022. We used the proceeds to repay a portion of the then-outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nWe have exposure due to nonperformance under our MVC contracts whereby a customer, who was not meeting its MVCs, does not have the wherewithal to make its MVC shortfall payments when they become due. We typically receive payment for all prior-year MVC shortfall billings in the quarter immediately following billing. Therefore, our exposure to risk of nonperformance is limited to and accumulates during the current year-to-date contracted measurement period.\n \u2022 our inclusion of expected annual or multi-year MVC shortfall payments. With respect to the impact of a net change in deferred revenue for MVC shortfall payments, we treated increases in deferred revenue balances as a favorable adjustment to segment adjusted EBITDA, while decreases in deferred revenue balances were treated as an unfavorable adjustment to segment adjusted EBITDA. We also included a proportional amount of any historical and expected MVC shortfall payments in each quarter prior to the quarter in which we actually recognized the shortfall payment. \nInterest expense. Interest expense associated with our Revolving Credit Facility and our Senior Notes as well as amortization expense associated with debt issuance costs.\n system and temporary production curtailments. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in volume throughput associated with new wells completed in 2017 and 2018. \n \u2022 our ability to gather, treat and/or process production that has been released from commitments with our competitors. \nFinancial data for our Permian Basin reportable segment follows.\nYear ended December 31, 2017. Segment adjusted EBITDA decreased $8.4 million during 2017, compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting:\n \u2022 In December 2017, in connection with certain strategic initiatives, we performed a financial review of certain assets within the Williston Basin reporting segment. This resulted in a triggering event that required us to perform a recoverability test. Based on the results of the test, we concluded that the carrying value of certain intangible and long-lived assets related to the Bison Midstream system in the Williston Basin were not fully recoverable and we recorded an impairment charge of $187.1 million. \n \u2022 Trends and Outlook \n \u2022 In February 2017, we completed a secondary public offering of 4,000,000 SMLP common units held by a subsidiary of Summit Investments in accordance with our obligations under our Partnership Agreement. We did not receive any proceeds from this secondary offering. \n \u2022 a $13.3 million decrease in gathering services and related fees for the Williston Basin segment due to the reclassification of amounts under certain percent-of-proceeds arrangements currently recognized on a net basis in cost of natural gas and NGLs under Topic 606 (see Note 3 in the consolidated financial statements). \n \u2022 the Permian Basin, which is served by Summit Permian; \nDeferred Purchase Price Obligation\n \u2022 a $3.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily driven by an increase in assets placed into service in the Summit Utica system. \nThe components of the net change in cash and cash equivalents were as follows:\nnon-capitalized maintenance costs, integrity management costs, utilities and contract services comprise the most significant portion of our operation and maintenance expense. Other than utilities expense, these expenses are largely independent of volumes delivered through our gathering systems but may fluctuate depending on the activities performed during a specific period.\nFinancing activities. Details of cash flows from financing activities follow.\nDeveloping, owning and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets requires significant investment in the maintenance of existing gathering systems and the construction and development of new gathering systems and other midstream assets and facilities.\nOur expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about, or interpretations of, available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.\nFinancial data for our Utica Shale reportable segment follows.\n \u2022 the recognition of $37.7 million of previously deferred revenue related to a certain Williston Basin customer. \nFinancial data for our Piceance Basin reportable segment follows.\n \u2022 $316.0 million of net borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, which included $360.0 million of borrowings to fund the 2016 Drop Down and reflected a repayment in September 2016 with funds from the issuance of common units noted below; \nCost of natural gas and NGLs increased $29.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting:\n \u2022 competitive conditions in our industry and their impact on our ability to connect hydrocarbon supplies to our gathering and processing assets or systems; \nOperation and maintenance. Operation and maintenance primarily comprises direct labor costs, compression costs, ad valorem taxes, repair and non-capitalized maintenance costs, integrity management costs, utilities and contract services. These items represent the most significant portion of our operation and maintenance expense. Other than utilities expense, these expenses are largely independent of variations in throughput volumes but may fluctuate depending on the activities performed during a specific period.\nCash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily reflected:\n \u2022 a $66.4 million increase in natural gas, NGLs and condensate sales primarily attributable to increased natural gas and/or crude oil marketing activity for the Piceance Basin, DJ Basin, Barnett Shale and Williston Basin segments. \n \u2022 a volume throughput decrease of 52 MMcf/d for the Barnett Shale segment. \nRevenues. Total revenues increased $17.9 million, during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting:\n\nInterest Expense. The decrease in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior period, was as a result of (i) the tender and redemption of the $300.0 million principal 7.5% Senior Notes, (ii) the issuance of 300,000 Series A Preferred Units in November 2017 whereby the net proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and (iii) a lower average outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility. The decrease was partially offset by the interest associated with issuance of the $500.0 million principal 5.75% Senior Notes and an increase in the interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility.\n\n(1) Reflects cash and noncash consideration, including working capital and capital expenditure adjustments paid (received), for acquisitions and/or drop downs (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements).\nCapital Requirements\nCost of natural gas and NGLs. The cost of natural gas and NGLs represents (i) the purchase of natural gas and NGLs associated with marketing activity surrounding certain of our natural gas and crude oil-related operations and (ii) the costs associated with the percent-of-proceeds arrangements under which we sell natural gas and NGLs purchased from certain of our customers on the Bison Midstream and Grand River systems.\nIn 2017, we updated the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation based on management's estimate of forecasted Business Adjusted EBITDA and capital expenditures for the 2016 Drop Down Assets. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower expected Business Adjusted EBITDA in 2018 and 2019 associated with the 2016 Drop Down Assets partially offset by lower estimated capital expenditures. The revision in estimated Business Adjusted EBITDA and estimated capital expenditures reflects a slower expected pace of drilling and completion activities from our customers, particularly in the Utica Shale in 2018 and 2019. As of December 31, 2017, we estimated the undiscounted future value of the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation to be approximately $454.4 million. As a result of revisions in these estimates, the estimated undiscounted future payment obligation decreased by $375.9 million relative to the estimate as of December 31, 2016. The revised estimates had a favorable impact on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 (see Notes 2 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements).\nDeferred Purchase Price Obligation\nOur long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, amortizing intangible assets and goodwill.\n \u2022 a $13.6 million increase in natural gas, NGLs and condensate sales attributable to the impact of higher comparative commodity pricing in the Williston Basin, Piceance Basin and DJ Basin segments. \n shortfall in a contract with no banking mechanism or claw back provision; (iii) the customer's banking mechanism has expired; or (iv) it is remote that the customer will use its unexercised right. \n \u2022 a $4.3 million increase in gathering services and related fees primarily as a result of higher volumes generated by increased drilling and completion activity. \n \u2022 a $19.3 million increase in cost of natural gas and NGLs driven by higher natural gas marketing volumes due to increased marketing activity surrounding our natural gas-related operations and the impact of higher comparative commodity pricing. \nOperation and maintenance expense decreased $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior period primarily due to a decrease in expenses that we pass through to our customers. The decrease was primarily a result of lower volume throughput in the Williston Basin and Barnett Shale segments.\n at-the-market offerings as defined by SEC rules. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we did not issue any units under the ATM Program. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we issued 763,548 units under the ATM Program for aggregate gross proceeds of $17.7 million, and paid approximately $0.2 million as compensation to the sales agents pursuant to the terms of the equity distribution agreement. Our General Partner made capital contributions to maintain its approximate 2% General Partner interest in SMLP. Following the effectiveness of the new ATM registration statement and after taking into account the aggregate sales price of common units sold under the ATM Program through December 31, 2018, we have the capacity to issue additional common units under the ATM Program up to an aggregate $132.3 million. \nFinancial data for our Barnett Shale reportable segment follows.\nLiquids. The increase in liquids volume throughput during 2018 primarily reflected well completion activity by existing customers on our Polar and Divide system in the second half of 2017 and in 2018 as well as the addition of new customers.\nWe examine the creditworthiness of counterparties to whom we extend credit and manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, credit approval, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and for certain transactions, we may request letters of credit, prepayments or guarantees.\nFor additional information on our organization and systems, see Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\n2017 Impairments. In December 2017, in connection with certain strategic initiatives, we performed a financial review of certain assets within the Williston Basin reporting segment. This resulted in a triggering event that required us to perform a recoverability test. Based on the results of the test, we concluded that the carrying value of certain long-lived assets and the related intangible assets related to the Bison Midstream system in the Williston Basin were not fully recoverable. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $101.9 million related to the long-lived assets and $85.2 million related to contract intangibles assets.\n \u2022 the impact of the 2017 recognition of $187.1 million of certain intangible and long-lived asset impairments relating to the Bison Midstream system in the Williston Basin segment. \n \u2022 Ohio Gathering, which includes our ownership interest in OGC and OCC; \n \u2022 the recognition of $2.6 million of business interruption recoveries for the Williston Basin segment. \n* Not considered meaningful\n \u2022 revenues; \nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Amortizing Intangible Assets. As of December 31, 2018, we had net property, plant and equipment with a carrying value of approximately $2.0 billion and net amortizing intangible assets with a carrying value of approximately $273.4 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n \u2022 a $19.3 million increase in purchases associated with our natural gas and crude oil marketing services and an increase due to higher comparative commodity pricing and throughput of NGLs on our Williston Basin and Piceance Basin segments and the associated impact on (i) our percent-of-proceeds arrangements for the Bison Midstream system and (ii) our percent-of-proceeds arrangements and condensate sales for the Grand River system. \n \u2022 Increased natural gas, NGLs and condensate sales and cost of natural gas and NGLs associated with increased marketing related activities. \n(3) Reflects proceeds from underwritten primary offerings.\nOperation and Maintenance Expenses\n* Not considered meaningful\n \u2022 the extent and success of our customers' drilling efforts, as well as the quantity of natural gas, crude oil and produced water volumes produced within proximity of our assets; \n \u2022 other changes in working capital. \n \u2022 a $4.8 million decrease in distributions from Ohio Gathering. \n\n2018 Impairments. In December 2018, in connection with certain strategic initiatives, we performed a recoverability assessment of certain assets within the Williston Basin reporting segment. Based on the results, we concluded that the carrying value of certain long-lived assets related to the Tioga Midstream system within the Williston Basin were not fully recoverable. We recorded an impairment charge of $3.9 million related to these assets after comparing the fair value of the long-lived assets to their carrying values. In addition, we reviewed other assets that had been identified as potentially impaired and recognized long-lived asset impairments as detailed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 commercial bank and capital market conditions and the potential impact of changes or disruptions in the credit and/or equity capital markets; \n \u2022 any other issues that can result in deficiencies in the design, installation or operation of our gathering, treating and processing facilities; \nNatural gas, NGLs and condensate sales. Revenue earned from (i) the sale of physical natural gas and/or NGLs purchased under percentage-of-proceeds arrangements with certain of our customers on the Bison Midstream and Grand River systems, (ii) natural gas and crude oil marketing services in and around our gathering systems, (iii) the sale of natural gas we retain from certain DFW Midstream customers and (iv) the sale of condensate we retain from our gathering services at Grand River.\nGoodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually on September 30 and whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill.\nForward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are inherently subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of our management team. All forward-looking statements in this report and subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or to persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements in this paragraph. These risks and uncertainties include, among others:\n* Not considered meaningful\n \u2022 $181.5 million of distributions paid; \nWith respect to property, plant and equipment and our amortizing intangible assets, the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if the carrying value exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the asset's use and eventual disposal. In this situation, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the asset's fair value. We determine fair value using an income-based approach in which we discount the asset's expected future cash flows to reflect the risk associated with achieving the underlying cash flows. Any impairment determinations involve significant assumptions and judgments. Differing assumptions regarding any of these inputs could have a significant effect on the various valuations. As such, the fair value measurements utilized within these estimates are classified as non-recurring Level 3 measurements in the fair value hierarchy because they are not observable from objective sources. Due to the volatility of the inputs used, we cannot predict the likelihood of any future impairment.\nVolume throughput declined during 2018 reflecting natural production declines, partially offset by new volumes from completion activity during the fourth quarter of 2017, first quarter of 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2018.\n \u2022 Capital markets activity and cost of capital; and \nIn February 2017, we issued $500.0 million principal of 5.75% senior, unsecured notes due 2025. We used the proceeds from the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes to (i) fund the repurchase of the outstanding $300.0 million principal 7.5% Senior Notes, (ii) pay redemption and call premiums on the 7.5% Senior Notes totaling $17.9 million and (iii) pay $172.0 million of the balance outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nEarly Extinguishment of Debt. The early extinguishment of debt recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven by the tender and redemption of the $300.0 million principal amount of 7.5% Senior Notes.\nCost of Natural Gas and NGLs. Cost of natural gas and NGLs increased $50.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting:\n \u2022 Critical Accounting Estimates \n \u2022 the impact of the 2017 recognition of $37.7 million of previously deferred revenue related to a certain Williston Basin customer. \nNatural gas throughput volumes increased 220 MMcf/d during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to prior year, primarily reflected:\nWe also have indirect exposure to changes in commodity prices in that persistently low commodity prices may cause our customers to delay and/or cancel drilling and/or completion activities or temporarily shut-in production, which would reduce the volumes of natural gas and crude oil (and associated volumes of produced water) that we gather. If certain of our customers cancel or delay drilling and/or completion activities or temporarily shut-in production, the associated MVCs, if any, ensure that we will earn a minimum amount of revenue.\nUtica Shale. The Utica Shale reportable segment includes the Summit Utica system. Volume throughput for our Summit Utica system follows.\nTotal revenues increased $86.4 million, during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year, primarily reflected:\n \u2022 a $8.4 million decrease in depreciation and amortization primarily due to the impairment of certain intangible and long-lived assets relating to the Bison Midstream system in the Williston Basin segment recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017. \n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $6.0 million in gathering services and related fees from MVC shortfall adjustments. Under Topic 606, we recognize customer obligations under their MVCs as revenue and contract assets when (i) we consider it remote that the customer will utilize shortfall payments to offset gathering or processing fees in excess of its MVCs in subsequent periods; (ii) the customer incurs a \n(2) See Notes 17 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements and Business - Recent Developments\u201d.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\n \u2022 Summit Permian, an associated natural gas gathering and processing system in the northern Delaware Basin, which includes the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring formations, in southeastern New Mexico. \nFollowing the February 2017 secondary offering, we can issue up to $1.50 billion of debt and equity securities in primary offerings and a total of 32,701,230 common units held by (i) a subsidiary of Summit Investments and (ii) affiliates of our Sponsor pursuant to the 2016 SRS. The 2016 SRS expires in November 2019.\n \u2022 a decrease in distributions from equity method investees; and \nYear ended December 31, 2018. Segment adjusted EBITDA decreased $3.7 million during 2018, compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting:\nOperation and Maintenance. Operation and maintenance expense increased $3.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior period, primarily due to an increase in planned compressor overhaul maintenance.\n \u2022 the recognition of $37.7 million of previously deferred revenue related to a certain Williston Basin customer. \nVolume throughput increased during 2017 due to the ongoing development of the system and completion of new wells during 2017. In addition, the TPL-7 connector project contributed to increased volumes.\n \u2022 a $3.7 million decrease in gathering services and related fees from a lower gathering rate mix associated with increasing volumes from the TPL-7 connector project, which was commissioned in the first quarter of 2017, along with a decrease in volume throughput from wells that we gather from pad sites on the Summit Utica \nFinancial data for our Williston Basin reportable segment follows.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n \u2022 the reclassification of $13.3 million in cost of natural gas and NGLs for the Williston Basin segment under certain percent-of-proceeds arrangements previously recognized in gathering services and related fees, which is presented net in cost of natural gas and NGLs under Topic 606. \n(1) Includes the amortization expense associated with our favorable and unfavorable gas gathering contracts as reported in other revenues.\nCertain of our customers may be temporarily unable to meet their current obligations. While this may cause disruption to cash flows, we believe that we are properly positioned to deal with the potential disruption because the vast majority of our gathering assets are strategically positioned at the beginning of the midstream value chain. The majority of our infrastructure is connected directly to our customers' wellheads and pad sites, which means our gathering systems are typically the first third-party infrastructure through which our customers' commodities flow and, in many cases, the only way for our customers to get their production to market.\n \u2022 the Marcellus Shale, which is served by Mountaineer Midstream. \nCash flows used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily reflected:\n \u2022 a $4.3 million decrease, after taking into account the adjustments related to MVC shortfall payments and adjustments related to capital reimbursement activity, in gathering services and related fees associated with the expiration of MVCs during 2017 of $3.6 million in addition to lower volume throughput. \n \u2022 fluctuations in natural gas, NGLs and crude oil prices; \n \u2022 a $13.3 million decrease in the cost of natural gas and NGLs for the Williston Basin segment due to the reclassification of amounts under certain percent-of-proceeds arrangements under Topic 606 that were previously recognized in gathering services and related fees. \nNatural Gas, NGLs and Condensate Sales. Natural gas, NGLs and condensate sales increased $66.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting the addition of natural gas, NGL and crude oil marketing services provided for the Piceance Basin, DJ Basin, Barnett Shale and Williston Basin segments.\n \u2022 a $3.0 million increase in operation and maintenance expense primarily due to planned compressor overhaul maintenance. \n\n \u2022 $293.2 million of net proceeds from the issuance of Series A Preferred units in November 2017. \n* Not considered meaningful\n \u2022 Niobrara G&P, an associated natural gas gathering and processing system operating in the DJ Basin, which includes the Niobrara and Codell shale formations in northeastern Colorado; and \nOur business has been, and we expect our future business to continue to be, affected by the following key trends:\nYear ended December 31, 2017. Segment adjusted EBITDA decreased $13.1 million during 2017, compared to the prior period primarily reflecting:\n \u2022 $205.0 million of net borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. \n \u2022 In February 2017, we completed a public offering of $500.0 million principal amount of 5.75% Senior Notes. Concurrent with and following the offering, we initiated a tender offer for the outstanding 7.5% Senior Notes. All remaining 7.5% Senior Notes were redeemed on March 18, 2017, with payment made on March 20, 2017. We used the proceeds from the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes to (i) fund the repurchase of the outstanding $300.0 million principal amount of 7.5% Senior Notes, (ii) pay redemption and call premiums on the 7.5% Senior Notes totaling $17.9 million and (iii) pay $172.0 million of the balance outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. \nVolume throughput increased during 2018 and 2017, compared to the prior periods, primarily as a result of ongoing drilling and completion activity across our service area.\n \u2022 a $0.4 million decrease in operation and maintenance expense primarily as a result of higher expenses incurred in 2016 associated with repairs to rights-of-way. \n \u2022 In September 2016, we completed an underwritten public offering of 5,500,000 common units at a price of $23.20 per unit and used the net proceeds to pay down our Revolving Credit Facility. Following the offering, our General Partner made a capital contribution to us to maintain its approximate 2% general partner interest. \nThe increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior period, was primarily driven by the interest associated with issuance of the $500.0 million principal 5.75% Senior Notes and an increase in the interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility. These increases were partially offset by (i) the tender and redemption of the $300.0 million principal 7.5% Senior Notes, (ii) a lower outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility and (iii) the issuance of 300,000 Series A Preferred Units in November 2017 whereby the net proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nWe recognized the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation to reflect the present value of the Remaining Consideration. Our calculation of the Remaining Consideration incorporates:\nWe classify our midstream energy infrastructure assets into two categories:\n \u2022 the effects of litigation; \n \u2022 the level of work-overs and recompletions of wells on existing pad sites to which our gathering systems are connected; \nNatural gas. Natural gas volume throughput decreased during 2018 and 2017, primarily reflecting natural production declines.\nWe classify deferred revenue as a current liability for arrangements where the expiration of a customer's right to utilize shortfall payments is twelve months or less. We classify deferred revenue as noncurrent for arrangements where the expiration of the right to utilize shortfall payments and our estimate of its potential utilization is more than 12 months. As of December 31, 2018, current deferred revenue totaled $11.5 million. Noncurrent deferred revenue totaled $39.5\n \u2022 How We Evaluate Our Operations \n \u2022 $209.2 million of distributions paid; and \nThe acquisition component and greenfield development projects of our growth strategy has required and will continue to require significant expenditures by us. Consequently, our ability to develop and maintain sources of funds to meet our capital requirements is critical to our ability to meet our growth objectives. We intend to continue to pursue accretive acquisitions of midstream assets from third parties. However, their size, timing and/or contribution to our operations and financial results cannot be reasonably estimated. Furthermore, there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our current expectations to change, including, but not limited to, (i) the ability to reach agreement with third parties; (ii) prevailing conditions and outlook in the natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids industries and markets and (iii) our ability to obtain financing from commercial banks, the capital markets, or other sources such as our Sponsor and Summit Investments, among other factors.\nVolumes - Gas. Natural gas throughput volumes decreased 75 MMcf/d during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting:\nThe estimates and expectations used in calculating the prospective component of Remaining Consideration and the present value calculation of the Remaining Consideration involve a significant amount of judgment as the calculations are, in part, based on future events and/or conditions, including (i) revenues, (ii) estimates of future volume throughput, capital expenditures, operating costs and their timing and (iii) economic and regulatory climates, among other factors. Our estimates of these inputs are inherently imprecise because they reflect our expectation of future conditions that are largely outside of our control. While the assumptions used are consistent with our current business plans and investment decisions, these assumptions could change significantly during the period leading up to settlement of the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation. See Notes 17 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements and Business - Recent Developments\u201d for additional information.\nOur financial results are recognized as follows:\n \u2022 a $1.5 million decrease in general and administrative expenses. \n \u2022 the recognition of $2.6 million of business interruption recoveries for the Williston Basin segment. \n(3) Represents agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding.\n \u2022 an $8.5 million increase in cash interest payments; and \nThe following table presents certain consolidated and reportable segment financial data. For additional information on our reportable segments, see the \"Segment Overview for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016\" section herein.\nRevenues\n* Not considered meaningful\nNovember 2016 Shelf Registration Statement. In October 2016, we filed the 2016 SRS and in November 2016, the SEC declared it effective. The following transactions have been executed pursuant thereto:\nYear ended December 31, 2017. The following items are reflected in our financial results:\n \u2022 a volume throughput increase of 179 MMcf/d for the Utica Shale segment. \nTrends and Outlook\n \u2022 our ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells in the areas in which we operate outside of our existing AMIs; and \nMD&A is intended to inform the reader about matters affecting the financial condition and results of operations of SMLP and its subsidiaries. As a result, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this report. Among other things, the consolidated financial statements and the related notes include more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following information. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that constitute our plans, estimates and beliefs. These forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those discussed in Forward-Looking Statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\nraised its benchmark federal-funds rate from a range of 1.25% and 1.50% in December 2017 to a range between 2.25% and 2.50% in December 2018. The Federal Reserve may continue to raise interest rates in the future, to the extent that economic growth continues. Capital markets conditions, including but not limited to availability and higher borrowing costs, could affect our ability to access the debt capital markets to the extent necessary to fund our future growth. Furthermore, market demand for equity issued by master limited partnerships has been significantly lower in recent years than it has been historically, which may make it more challenging for us to finance our expansion capital expenditures and acquisition capital expenditures with the issuance of additional equity. We recently announced a planned reduction in our common unit distribution to $0.2875 per quarter, beginning with the distribution to be paid in respect of the first quarter of 2019, and this reduction may further reduce demand for our common units. In addition, interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly. Although this could limit our ability to raise debt capital on acceptable terms, we expect to remain competitive with respect to acquisitions and capital projects, as our peers and competitors would likely face similar circumstances.\nSenior Notes. In June 2013, the Co-Issuers co-issued the 7.5% Senior Notes, and in July 2014, the Co-Issuers co-issued the 5.5% Senior Notes. In February 2017, the Co-Issuers co-issued the 5.75% Senior Notes. The 7.5% Senior Notes were tendered and redeemed during the first quarter of 2017. There were no defaults or events of default during 2018 on any series of senior notes.\nDeferred Revenue. We record customer billings for obligations under their MVCs as deferred revenue when the customer has the right to utilize shortfall payments to offset gathering or processing fees in subsequent periods. We recognize deferred revenue under these arrangements in revenue when (i) we consider it remote that the customer will utilize shortfall payments to offset gathering or processing fees in excess of its MVCs in subsequent periods; (ii) the customer incurs a shortfall in a contract with no banking mechanism or claw back provision; (iii) the customer's banking mechanism has expired; or (iv) it is remote that the customer will use its unexercised right. We also recognize deferred revenue when it is determined that a given amount of MVC shortfall payments cannot be recovered by offsetting gathering or processing fees in subsequent contracted measurement periods. In making this determination, we consider both quantitative and qualitative facts and circumstances, including, but not limited to, contract terms, capacity of the associated pipeline or receipt point and/or expectations regarding future investment, drilling and production.\n \u2022 Mountaineer Midstream, a natural gas gathering system operating in the Appalachian Basin, which includes the Marcellus Shale formation in northern West Virginia. \n \u2022 In 2018, the present value of the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation increased by $21.0 million. The change was primarily due to the passage of time and an associated decrease in the discount rate, partially offset by the continued slowing and deferral of drilling and completion activities to periods outside of the DPPO measurement period (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements). \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization decreased during 2018 largely as a result of the long-lived asset impairment recognized in 2017. \nIn 2017, we updated the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation based on management's estimate of forecasted Business Adjusted EBITDA and capital expenditures for the 2016 Drop Down Assets. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower expected Business Adjusted EBITDA in 2018 and 2019 associated with the 2016 Drop Down Assets, partially offset by lower estimated capital expenditures. The revision in estimated Business Adjusted EBITDA and estimated capital expenditures reflects a slower expected pace of drilling and completion activities from our customers, particularly in the Utica Shale in 2018 and 2019. As of December 31, 2017, we estimated the undiscounted future value of the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation to be approximately $454.4 million. As a result of revisions in these estimates, the estimated undiscounted future payment obligation decreased by $375.9 million relative to the estimate as of December 31, 2016. The revised estimates had a favorable impact on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\n \u2022 Results of Operations \n \u2022 $167.5 million of distributions paid in 2016; and \nCash flows used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily reflected:\n \u2022 a $1.2 million decrease in operation and maintenance expense primarily due to declines in expenses for repairs to right-of-way of $0.9 million and lower property taxes of $0.7 million during the period. \nWe are the owner-operator of the following gathering systems, which comprise our Legacy Areas:\n \u2022 operational risks and hazards inherent in the gathering, treating and/or processing of natural gas, crude oil and produced water; \nFinancial data for our DJ Basin reportable segment follows.\n\n \u2022 a $63.7 million increase in natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate purchases driven by increased natural gas, NGL and crude oil marketing activity for the Piceance Basin, DJ Basin, Barnett Shale and Williston Basin segments. \n \u2022 a $22.9 million increase in natural gas, NGLs and condensate sales attributable to increased marketing activity surrounding our natural gas-related operations and the impact of higher comparative commodity pricing. \nWilliston Basin. The Polar and Divide, Tioga Midstream and Bison Midstream systems provide our midstream services for the Williston Basin reportable segment. Volume throughput for our Williston Basin reportable segment follows.\nFor additional information on volumes, see the \"Segment Overview for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016\" section herein.\nWe conduct and report our operations in the midstream energy industry through eight reportable segments. We evaluate our business operations each reporting period to determine whether any of our operating segments in which we internally report financial information are considered significant and would require us to separately disclose certain segment financial information in our external reporting. As a result of our evaluation, during the fourth quarter of 2018, we determined that the DJ Basin natural gas gathering and processing system, previously reported within the Piceance/DJ Basins reportable segment, is expected to be a significant operating segment in future reporting periods. This determination was based on, among other things, the development of a new 60 MMcf/d processing plant that is expected to be operational in 2019, which will increase volume throughput beginning in 2019. In addition, we determined the Permian Basin natural gas gathering and processing system, which was commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2018, is expected to be a significant operating segment in future reporting periods. As such, we modified our current segments in the fourth quarter of 2018 such that the DJ Basin reportable segment includes the Niobrara G&P system and the Permian Basin reportable segment includes the Summit Permian natural gas gathering and processing system. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we have disclosed the required segment information for Niobrara G&P and Summit Permian and the periods prior have been recast to reflect this change. Our reportable segments are as follows:\n \u2022 Tioga Midstream, a crude oil, produced water and associated natural gas gathering system operating in the Williston Basin, which includes the Bakken and Three Forks shale formations in northwestern North Dakota; \nGross volume throughput for Ohio Gathering, based on a one-month lag follows.\n \u2022 throughput volume; \n\n \u2022 a $10.6 million decrease in gathering services and related fees largely as a result of natural production declines and reduced drilling and completion activity. \n \u2022 The adjustments related to MVC shortfall payments for 2017 is primarily driven by the recognition of $37.7 million of gathering services and related fees revenue that had been previously deferred, and recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred revenue, in connection with an MVC arrangement with a certain Williston Basin customer, for which we determined we had no further performance obligations. As a result, the increase in gathering services and related fees compared with the first half of 2016 was offset by the change in adjustments related to MVC shortfall payments, with no impact on segment adjusted EBITDA. \n \u2022 a $13.3 million decrease in gathering services and related fees for the Williston Basin segment due to the reclassification of amounts under certain percent-of-proceeds arrangements currently recognized on a net basis in cost of natural gas and NGLs under Topic 606. \n \u2022 Core Focus Areas - production basins in which we expect our gathering systems to experience greater long-term growth, driven by our customers ability to generate more favorable returns and support sustained drilling and completion activity in varying commodity price environments. In the near-term, we expect to concentrate the majority of our capital expenditures in our Core Focus Areas. Our Utica Shale, Ohio Gathering, Williston Basin, DJ Basin and Permian Basin reportable segments (as described below) comprise our Core Focus Areas. \n\nWhen evidence exists that we will not be able to recover a long-lived asset's carrying value through future cash flows, we write down the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value. We test assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable as well as in connection with any goodwill impairment evaluations.\nYear ended December 31, 2017. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $13.0 million during 2017, compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting:\nOperating activities. Cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily reflected:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n___________\nInvesting activities. Details of cash flows from investing activities follow.\n \u2022 a $1.5 million increase in operation and maintenance expense primarily due to $1.1 million of higher electricity expenses we pass through to certain customers (which is also included in the increase in Other revenues in the table above) in addition to higher operation and maintenance costs to support volume growth. \nYear ended December 31, 2018. Segment adjusted EBITDA for equity method investees decreased $1.3 million during 2018, compared to the prior period, primarily as a result of higher expenses, partially offset by higher volumes at OGC and OCC.\n \u2022 Bison Midstream, an associated natural gas gathering system operating in the Williston Basin, which includes the Bakken and Three Forks shale formations in northwestern North Dakota; \n \u2022 operation and maintenance expenses; and \nNatural gas, NGLs and condensate sales increased $32.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting the addition of natural gas, NGL and crude oil marketing services provided for the Piceance Basin, DJ Basin and Barnett Shale segments and the impact of higher comparative commodity pricing and throughput of NGLs on our Williston Basin, Piceance Basin and DJ Basin segments.\nVolume throughput for our Barnett Shale reportable segment follows.\n \u2022 Summit Utica, a natural gas gathering system operating in the Appalachian Basin, which includes the Utica and Point Pleasant shale formations in southeastern Ohio; \nAdjustments for MVC Shortfall Payments. We estimate the impact of expected MVC shortfall payments for inclusion in our calculation of segment adjusted EBITDA. Adjustments related to MVC shortfall payments account for:\n\nVolume throughput decreased during 2018, compared to the prior period, primarily due to natural production declines. These declines were partially offset by volumes generated by the completion, in the second half of 2017 and first quarter of 2018, of a number of drilled but uncompleted ( DUC\u201d) wells.\nRevolving Credit Facility. We have a $1.25 billion senior secured Revolving Credit Facility. On May 26, 2017, Summit Holdings closed on the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement which extended the maturity from November 2018 to May 2022 (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements). As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding balance of the Revolving Credit Facility was $466.0 million and the unused portion totaled $784.0 million. There were no defaults or events of default during 2018, and as of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the financial covenants in the Revolving Credit Facility.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental financial measure used by management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others.\nCorporate and Other represents those results that are not specifically attributable to a reportable segment or that have not been allocated to our reportable segments, including certain general and administrative expense items, natural gas and crude oil marketing services, transaction costs, interest expense, early extinguishment of debt and a change in the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation fair value.\n \u2022 $31.6 million of capital contributions to Ohio Gathering. \n\n \u2022 a volume throughput decrease of 6 MMcf/d for the Utica Shale segment. \n \u2022 a volume throughput increase of 4 MMcf/d for the DJ Basin segment. \nFinancial data for our Ohio Gathering reportable segment, based on a one-month lag follows.\nYear ended December 31, 2018. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $0.9 million during 2018, compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting:\n \u2022 In December 2018, in connection with certain strategic initiatives, we performed a recoverability assessment of certain assets within the Williston Basin reporting segment. Based on the results, we concluded that the carrying value of certain long-lived assets related to the Tioga Midstream system in the Williston Basin were not fully recoverable and we recorded an impairment charge of $3.9 million. \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization increased over 2016, compared to the prior period, as a result of placing assets into service. \n \u2022 a volume throughput increase of 87 MMcf/d for the Marcellus Shale segment. \n \u2022 a volume throughput decrease of 31 MMcf/d for the Piceance Basin segment. \nContractual Obligations Update\n \u2022 the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to make cash distributions and support our indebtedness; \n \u2022 a $3.6 million decrease in gathering services and related fees for the Barnett Shale segment largely as a result of the expiration of an MVC during 2017. \nWe prepare our financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These principles are established by the FASB. We employ methods, estimates and assumptions based on currently available information when recording transactions resulting from business operations. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOhio Gathering. The Ohio Gathering reportable segment includes OGC and OCC. We account for our investment in Ohio Gathering using the equity method. We recognize our proportionate share of earnings or loss in net income on a one-month lag based on the financial information available to us during the reporting period.\n\n \u2022 In November 2017, we issued 300,000 Series A Preferred Units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership at a price of $1,000 per unit. We used the net proceeds of $293.2 million to repay outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. \nMinimum Volume Commitments\n \u2022 certain factors discussed elsewhere in this report. \n__________\nThe following table presents certain consolidated data and volume throughput for the years ended December 31.\nForward-Looking Statements\nWe then discount the Remaining Consideration using a commensurate risk-adjusted discount rate and recognize the present value on our consolidated balance sheets with the change in present value recognized in earnings in the period of change.\nGeneral and administrative. Expenses associated with our operations that are not specifically associated with the operation and maintenance of a particular system or another cost and expense line item. These expenses largely reflect salaries, benefits and incentive compensation, professional fees, insurance and rent.\n \u2022 a $4.3 million increase for the Marcellus Shale segment primarily as a result of higher volumes generated by increased drilling and completion activity. \nThe volume of (i) natural gas that we gather, compress, treat and/or process and (ii) crude oil and produced water that we gather depends on the level of production from natural gas or crude oil wells connected to our gathering systems. Aggregate production volumes are impacted by the overall amount of drilling and completion activity. Furthermore, because the production rate of natural gas and crude oil wells decline over time, production can only be maintained or increased by new drilling or other activity.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, cash paid for capital expenditures totaled $200.6 million, compared with $124.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $142.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Maintenance capital expenditures totaled $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with $15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2018, contributions to equity method investees totaled $4.9 million, compared with $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). The year-over-year increase in cash paid for capital expenditures primarily reflected the expansion of our existing gathering and processing complex in the DJ Basin with the addition of a new 60 MMcf/d cryogenic processing plant in addition to the development of our new associated natural gas gathering and processing system in the Permian Basin.\nMarcellus Shale. The Mountaineer Midstream system provides our midstream services for the Marcellus Shale reportable segment.\n___________\n \u2022 our operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy sector, without regard to financing or capital structure; \nThis MD&A comprises the following sections:\nVolume throughput declined during 2017 as a result of seven wells being commissioned behind the DFW gathering system in the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to the higher drilling and completion activities throughout 2016.\n* Not considered meaningful\n \u2022 the Williston Basin, which is served by Polar and Divide, Tioga Midstream and Bison Midstream; \n \u2022 In the fourth quarter of 2018, we impaired certain long-lived assets relating to the Tioga Midstream system in the Williston Basin (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). The impairment had no impact on segment adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2018. \n \u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources \nVolume throughput for the Ohio Gathering system decreased during 2017, compared to the prior period, primarily as a result of natural production declines and decreased drilling and completion activity. The decrease was partially offset by increased volumes associated with the installation of additional compression in the dry gas window beginning in March 2017.\nTotal costs and expenses increased $220.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior period, primarily reflected:\nTransaction costs. Financial and legal advisory costs associated with completed acquisitions and divestitures.\nIn addition, certain of our gathering systems are directly affected by crude oil supply and demand dynamics. Crude oil prices continued to increase during 2017 and 2018, with the average daily West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\") crude oil spot price increasing from an average $50.80 per barrel during 2017 to an average of $64.95 per barrel during 2018, representing a 28% increase. However, WTI closed at $45.91 per barrel on December 31, 2018 reflecting broader market concerns for global oil supply. In response to the general increase in crude oil prices, the number of active crude oil drilling rigs in the continental United States increased from 747 in December 2017 to 885 in December 2018, according to Baker Hughes. Over the next several years, we expect that crude oil prices will support continued drilling and increasing production in the Williston Basin, Permian Basin and DJ Basin.\nCash flows provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily reflected:\nWe rely primarily on internally generated cash flow as well as external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt, equity and preferred equity securities, to fund our capital expenditures. We believe that our Revolving Credit Facility, together with internally generated cash flow and financial support from our Sponsor and/or access to new debt or equity capital markets, will be adequate to finance our growth objectives for the foreseeable future without adversely impacting our liquidity or our ability to make quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders.\nDevelopments in any of these areas could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected or cause a significant reduction in the market price of our common units, preferred units and senior notes.\n \u2022 failure or delays by our customers in achieving expected production in their natural gas, crude oil and produced water projects; \nYear ended December 31, 2017. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $2.9 million during 2017, compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting:\n \u2022 In 2017, we updated the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation based on management's estimate of forecasted Business Adjusted EBITDA (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements) and capital expenditures for the 2016 Drop Down Assets. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower expected Business Adjusted EBITDA in 2018 and 2019 associated with the 2016 Drop Down Assets partially offset by lower estimated capital expenditures. The revision in estimated Business Adjusted EBITDA and estimated capital expenditures reflects a slower expected pace of drilling and completion activities from our customers, particularly in the Utica Shale in 2018 and 2019. As of December 31, 2017, we estimated the undiscounted future value of the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation to be approximately $454.4 million. As a result of revisions in these estimates, the estimated undiscounted future payment obligation decreased by $375.9 million relative to the estimate as of December 31, 2016. The revised estimates had a favorable impact on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 the availability, terms and cost of downstream transportation and processing services; \nYear ended December 31, 2018. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $10.3 million compared to the prior period primarily reflecting an increase in liquids volume throughput on our Polar and Divide system and $1.6 million in fees attributable to our Dakota Access Pipeline interconnect which was commissioned in the second quarter of 2017.\n \u2022 timely receipt of necessary government approvals and permits, our ability to control the costs of construction, including costs of materials, labor and rights-of-way and other factors that may impact our ability to complete projects within budget and on schedule; \n \u2022 In June 2016, an impairment loss was recognized by OCC. We recorded our 40% share of the impairment loss, or $37.8 million, in loss from equity method investees in the consolidated statements of operations. \n \u2022 $300.0 million paid for the repurchase of the outstanding 7.5% Senior Notes; \nEach of our reportable segments provides midstream services in a specific geographic area. Our reportable segments reflect the way in which we internally report the financial information used to make decisions and allocate resources in connection with our operations (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).\n \u2022 a $14.6 million increase for the Utica Shale segment due to the ongoing development of the Summit Utica system, including the commissioning of the TPL-7 connector project in late March 2017. \nTotal Revenues. Total revenues attributable to Corporate and Other was due to natural gas, NGL and crude oil marketing services activity (primarily natural gas sales) for the Piceance Basin, DJ Basin, Barnett Shale and Williston Basin segments.\nOur revenues are primarily attributable to the volumes that we gather, treat and/or process and the rates we charge for those services. A majority of our gathering and processing agreements are fee-based, which limits our direct exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. We also have percent-of-proceeds arrangements under which the gathering and processing revenues that we earn correlate directly with the fluctuating price of natural gas, condensate and NGLs.\nAdditional Information. For additional information, see the \"Results of Operations\" section herein and the notes to the consolidated financial statements. For information on pending accounting changes that are expected to materially impact our financial results reported in future periods, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.\nRecognition and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nIncome tax expense or benefit. Represents the expense or benefit associated with the Texas Margin Tax.\nOther items to note:\nDJ Basin. The Niobrara G&P system provides midstream services for the DJ Basin reportable segment. Volume throughput for our DJ Basin reportable segment follows.\nFor additional information on our long-term debt, see Notes 10 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n\nOur financial results are driven primarily by volume throughput and expense management. We generate the majority of our revenues from the gathering, treating and processing services that we provide to our customers. A majority of the volumes that we gather, treat and/or process have a fixed-fee rate structure which enhances the stability of our cash flows by providing a revenue stream that is not subject to direct commodity price risk. We also earn revenues from (i) the sale of physical natural gas and/or NGLs purchased under percentage-of-proceeds arrangements with certain of our customers on the Bison Midstream and Grand River systems, (ii) natural gas and crude oil marketing services in and around our gathering systems, (iii) the sale of natural gas we retain from certain DFW Midstream customers and (iv) the sale of condensate we retain from our gathering services at Grand River. These additional activities, including marketing transactions comprised of buy and sell arrangements, directly expose us to fluctuations in commodity prices and accounted for approximately 27% of total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2018. These additional activities, excluding marketing transactions comprised of buy and sell arrangements, accounted for approximately 11% of total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2018. We expect our natural gas and crude oil marketing services to increase in future periods.\nDepreciation and Amortization. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense during 2018 was primarily due to the impairment of certain intangible and long-lived assets on the Bison Midstream system in the Williston Basin segment recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense during 2017 was largely driven by an increase in assets placed into service in the Summit Utica system.\n\n(2) See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" herein and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital expenditures.\nAverage daily volume throughput during the year ended December 31, 2018 for the Permian Basin reportable segment totaled 1 MMcf/d.\nSegment Overview for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016", "item_7_text": " \u2022 a $3.8 million increase in gathering services and related fees, after taking into account the adjustments related to MVC shortfall payments, primarily as a result of volume growth from ongoing drilling and completion activity in addition to a favorable rate mix with certain customers. \nYear ended December 31, 2018. Segment adjusted EBITDA totaled ($1.2) million primarily reflecting less than one month's volume throughput of the Summit Permian natural gas gathering and processing system commissioned in December 2018 as well as operational and general and administrative expenses incurred during the year.\nYear ended December 31, 2018. The following items are reflected in our financial results:\n\nIn March 2016, we borrowed $360.0 million under our Revolving Credit Facility and recognized a liability of $507.4 million for the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation, both in connection with the 2016 Drop Down. The Deferred Purchase Price Obligation is due no later than December 31, 2020 and as of December 31, 2018, was expected to be $423.9 million based on information available as of December 31, 2018. Upon consummation of the Amendment and the $100 million prepayment of the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation, the Remaining Consideration under the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation will be reduced to $303.5 million, which will be payable by the Partnership in one or more payments over the period from March 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, payable in (i) cash, (ii) the Partnership's common units or (iii) a combination of cash and the Partnership's common units, at the discretion of the Partnership. No less than 50% of the Remaining Consideration shall be paid on or before June 30, 2020 and interest shall accrue at a rate of 8% per annum on any portion of the Remaining Consideration that remains unpaid after March 31, 2020.

Volume throughput was also no longer impacted by repairs on a downstream third-party NGL pipeline that occurred during 2016.\n \u2022 In February 2017, we executed a new equity distribution agreement and filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC for the issuance and sale from time to time of SMLP common units having an aggregate offering price of up to $150.0 million. These sales are made (i) pursuant to the terms of the equity distribution agreement between us and the sales agents named therein and (ii) by means of ordinary brokers' transactions at market prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed between us and the sales agents. Sales of our common units may be made in negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be \nRate of growth in production from U.S. shale plays. Some of our producer customers have adjusted their drilling and completion activities and schedules to manage drilling and completion costs at levels that are achievable using cash flow generated from the underlying operations. Historically, as part of a strategy to accelerate production growth, these producers would raise capital to fund drilling and completion costs in excess of the cash flows generated from their underlying assets. We expect that certain of our producers will continue to adopt and implement this revised strategy, which will likely result in a slower pace of growth in production across many of our systems relative to management's previous expectations. This dynamic is a significant contributing factor to our revision in the estimated undiscounted value of the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation as of December 31, 2018, relative to our estimate as of December 31, 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense decreased during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting reductions in information technology costs.\nCost of Natural Gas and NGLs.

In July 2017, we filed the 2017 SRS with the SEC to issue an indeterminate amount of debt, equity securities and guarantees. In November 2017, we filed a post-effective amendment to the 2017 SRS with the SEC to register, in addition to the classes of securities originally registered, an indeterminate amount of preferred units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. The 2017 SRS expires in July 2020.

The Summit Permian system provides our midstream services for the Permian Basin reportable segment.\nNatural gas, NGL and crude oil supply and demand dynamics. Natural gas continues to be a critical component of energy supply and demand in the United States. The average spot price of natural gas increased during 2018 relative to 2017. The average daily Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price was $3.15 per MMBtu during 2018, compared with $2.99 per MMBtu during 2017. Henry Hub closed at $3.19 per MMBtu on December 31, 2018. Despite these modest gains, natural gas prices continue to trade at lower-than-average historical prices due in part to increased natural gas production and the amount of natural gas in storage in the continental United States. In the near term, we believe that until the supply of natural gas in storage has been reduced, natural gas prices are likely to remain constrained. Over the long term, we believe that the prospects for continued natural gas demand are favorable and will be driven primarily by global population and economic growth, as well as the continued displacement of coal-fired electricity generation by natural gas-fired electricity generation.\nIn March 2016, we entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of Summit Investments to fund a portion of the 2016 Drop Down whereby we have recognized the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements and Business - Recent Developments\u201d).\n \u2022 Ohio Gathering, a natural gas gathering system and a condensate stabilization facility operating in the Appalachian Basin, which includes the Utica and Point Pleasant shale formations in southeastern Ohio; \nFor additional information, see Notes 10 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 an increase in gathering services and related fees primarily as a result of volume growth from ongoing drilling and completion activity. \nVolume throughput for the Marcellus Shale reportable segment follows.\n \u2022 In the fourth quarter of 2017, we impaired certain long-lived assets and contract intangible assets relating to the Bison Midstream system in the Williston Basin (see Notes 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements). These impairments had no impact on segment adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017. \n\n \u2022 the net increases or decreases in deferred revenue for MVC shortfall payments and \nCredit and Counterparty Concentration Risks\nShifts in operating costs and inflation. Throughout most of the last five years, high levels of crude oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities across the United States resulted in increased competition for personnel and equipment as well as higher prices for labor, supplies, equipment and other services. Beginning in 2015, this dynamic began to shift as prices for crude oil and natural gas-related services decreased in line with overall decline in demand for these goods and services. While we expect lower service-related costs in the near term, we expect that over the longer term, these costs will continue to have a high correlation to changes in the prevailing price of crude oil and natural gas.\n\n \u2022 weather conditions and terrain in certain areas in which we operate; \n \u2022 changes in general economic conditions; and \n \u2022 successful drilling activity within our AMIs; \n \u2022 the impact of the 2017 recognition of $37.7 million of previously deferred revenue related to a certain Williston Basin customer. \n \u2022 the number of new pad sites in our AMIs awaiting connections; \n \u2022 changes in the availability and cost of capital and the results of our financing efforts, including availability of funds in the credit and/or equity capital markets; \nVolume throughput increased during 2017, compared to the prior period, despite the continued suspended drilling activities by one of Grand River's key customers, primarily as a result of ongoing drilling and completion activity by other customers across our gathering footprint.\n(4) See Item 2. Properties and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.\nTransaction Costs. Transaction costs recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily relate to financial and legal advisory costs associated with the 2016 Drop Down.\nCash flows provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily reflected:\n \u2022 Polar and Divide, crude oil and produced water gathering systems and transmission pipelines located in the Williston Basin, which includes the Bakken and Three Forks shale formations in northwestern North Dakota; \nYear ended December 31, 2018. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $0.4 million during 2017, compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting:\nFinancial data for our Marcellus Shale reportable segment follows.\n \u2022 In November 2017, we issued 300,000 9.50% Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership at a price to the public of $1,000 per unit. We used the net proceeds of $293.2 million (after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses) to repay outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. \n \u2022 Overview \nBarnett Shale. The DFW Midstream system provides our midstream services for the Barnett Shale reportable segment.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\n(1) Early extinguishment of debt includes $17.9 million paid for redemption and call premiums, as well as $4.1 million of unamortized debt issuance costs which were written off in connection with the repurchase of the outstanding $300.0 million 7.5% Senior Notes in the first quarter of 2017.\n \u2022 a $6.0 million increase from the recognition of MVC shortfall adjustments for the Barnett Shale segment under Topic 606 (see Note 3 in the consolidated financial statements). \n \u2022 In March 2016, we acquired the 2016 Drop Down Assets from a subsidiary of Summit Investments. We funded the drop down with borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and the execution of the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation with Summit Investments (see Notes 12 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements). \nEarly Extinguishment of Debt. The early extinguishment of debt recognized during 2017 was driven by the tender and redemption of the $300.0 million principal 7.5% Senior Notes.\n \u2022 the effects of existing and future laws and governmental regulations, including environmental, safety and climate change requirements; \nOther income or expense. Generally represents other items of gain or loss but may also include interest income.\nCosts and Expenses. Total costs and expenses decreased $138.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting:\nDeferred Purchase Price Obligation. Deferred Purchase Price Obligation recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018 represents the change in present value of the estimated Remaining Consideration to be paid in connection with the 2016 Drop Down (see Notes 17 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements). The change was primarily due to the passage of time and an associated decrease in the discount rate, partially offset by the continued slowing and deferral of drilling and completion activities to periods outside of the DPPO measurement period.\nGathering Services and Related Fees. Gathering services and related fees decreased $49.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting:\nDepreciation and amortization. The depreciation of our property, plant and equipment and the amortization of our contract and right-of-way intangible assets.\nYear ended December 31, 2018. Segment adjusted EBITDA decreased $3.0 million during 2018, compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting:\nVolume throughput decreased during 2018, compared to the prior period, as a result of natural production declines, partially offset by drilling and completion activity that occurred across our service area during the second half of 2017 and through the third quarter of 2018.\n \u2022 a decrease in liquids volumes and a $3.3 million reduction in MVC shortfall payments, partially offset by $2.6 million of business interruption recoveries and the recognition of $1.6 million in gathering services and related fees relating to previously billed but unearned revenue in the second quarter of 2017. \n \u2022 DFW Midstream, a natural gas gathering system operating in the Fort Worth Basin, which includes the Barnett Shale formation in north-central Texas; and \nFor additional information, see Notes 2, 4 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements and the \"Results of Operations\" and \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Credit and Counterparty Concentration Risks\" sections herein.\nOn February 8, 2017, we amended the 2014 SRS to include additional guarantor subsidiaries and completed a public offering of $500.0 million principal 5.75% senior unsecured notes due 2025. Concurrent therewith, we made a tender offer to purchase all the outstanding 7.5% Senior Notes. The tender offer expired on February 14, 2017 with $276.9 million validly tendered. On February 16, 2017, we issued a notice of redemption for the 7.5% Senior Notes that remained outstanding subsequent to the tender offer. The remaining 7.5% Senior Notes were redeemed on March 18, 2017, with payment made on March 20, 2017. We used the proceeds from the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes to (i) fund the repurchase of the outstanding $300.0 million principal 7.5% Senior Notes, (ii) pay redemption and call premiums on the 7.5% Senior Notes totaling $17.9 million and (iii) pay $172.0 million of the balance outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nYear ended December 31, 2017. Segment adjusted EBITDA for equity method investees decreased $4.4 million during 2017, compared to the prior period, primarily due to natural production declines and decreased drilling and completion activity, partially offset by increased volumes associated with the installation of additional compression in the dry gas window beginning in March 2017.\nCash flows used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily reflected:\n \u2022 an increase in gathering services and related fees primarily as a result of volume growth from ongoing drilling and completion activity. \n \u2022 the ability to attract and retain key management personnel; \n \u2022 the Piceance Basin, which is served by Grand River; \n \u2022 $200.6 million of capital expenditures primarily attributable to the ongoing development of the Permian Basin of $83.8 million as well as the continued development in the DJ Basin of $64.9 million, and the Williston Basin of $25.2 million; \nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of or during the year ended December 31, 2018.\n \u2022 $124.2 million of capital expenditures primarily attributable to the ongoing development of the Summit Permian and Summit Utica systems as well as the continued development in the Williston Basin, Piceance Basin and DJ Basin segments; and \nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense decreased $1.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting a decrease in information technology expense of $1.3 million and an increase in capitalized labor of $0.7 million associated with the continued development of Summit Permian and the DJ Basin.\nCapital Markets Activity\n \u2022 $142.7 million of capital expenditures primarily attributable to the ongoing expansion of the 2016 Drop Down Assets and the Polar and Divide system; and \nYear ended December 31, 2017. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $5.6 million during 2017, compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting:\nWe are a growth-oriented limited partnership focused on developing, owning and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets that are strategically located in the core producing areas of unconventional resource basins, primarily shale formations, in the continental United States.\n(1) For the purpose of calculating future interest on the Revolving Credit Facility, assumes no change in balance or rate from December 31, 2018.

Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that may project, indicate or imply future results, events, performance or achievements and may contain the words expect,\u201d intend,\u201d plan,\u201d anticipate,\u201d estimate,\u201d believe,\u201d will be,\u201d will continue,\u201d will likely result,\u201d and similar expressions, or future conditional verbs such as may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d would,\u201d and could.\u201d In addition, any statement concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects, and possible actions taken by us, our subsidiaries, Summit Investments or our Sponsor, are also forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors included in this report.\nBased on the terms of our Partnership Agreement, we expect that we will distribute to our unitholders most of the cash generated by our operations. As a result, we expect to fund future capital expenditures from cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flows generated from our operations, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and future issuances of equity and debt instruments.\n \u2022 $387.0 million of net repayments under our Revolving Credit Facility; \n \u2022 a $6.0 million increase from the recognition of MVC shortfall adjustments for the Barnett Shale segment under Topic 606 (see Note 3 in the consolidated financial statements). \n \u2022 a $2.3 million increase, after taking into account the adjustments related to MVC shortfall payments and adjustments related to capital reimbursement activity, in gathering services and related fees primarily as a result of the drilling and completion activity that occurred across our service area by other customers during the second half of 2017 and through the third quarter of 2018, and a $1.0 million MVC shortfall payment received from a customer in 2018 that did not occur in 2017, partially offset by natural production declines. \nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased $7.6 million compared to prior period as a result of (i) the tender and redemption of the $300.0 million principal 7.5% Senior Notes, (ii) the issuance of 300,000 Series A Preferred Units in November 2017 whereby the net proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and (iii) a lower average outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility. The decrease was partially offset by the interest associated with issuance of the $500.0 million principal 5.75% Senior Notes and an increase in the interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility.\n \u2022 a $9.6 million increase in cost of natural gas and NGLs primarily for the Williston Basin segment due to the impact of increasing commodity prices on the percent-of-proceeds activity for the Bison Midstream system. \n \u2022 natural disasters, accidents, weather-related delays, casualty losses and other matters beyond our control; \nSegment adjusted EBITDA is used to assess:\n \u2022 Natural gas, NGL and crude oil supply and demand dynamics; \n* Not considered meaningful\n \u2022 the DJ Basin, which is served by Niobrara G&P; \n \u2022 a $10.9 million purchase of a noncontrolling interest; and \nmillion at December 31, 2018 and represents amounts that provide these customers the ability to offset their gathering fees, as determined by the MVC contract, to the extent that their throughput volumes exceed their MVC.\nGrowth in production from U.S. shale plays. Over the past several years, natural gas production from unconventional shale resources has increased significantly due to advances in technology that allow producers to extract significant volumes of natural gas from unconventional shale plays on favorable economic terms relative to most conventional plays. In recent years, a number of producers and their joint venture partners, including large international operators, industrial manufacturers and private equity sponsors, have committed significant capital to the development of these unconventional resources, including the Piceance, Barnett, Bakken, Marcellus, Utica and Permian Basin shale plays in which we operate, and we believe that these long-term capital investments will support drilling activity in unconventional shale plays over the long term.\n \u2022 an $8.3 million decrease for the Barnett Shale segment largely as a result of natural production declines and reduced drilling activity on the DFW Midstream system. \nThroughput Volume\nThe decrease in liquids volume throughput during 2017 primarily reflected natural production declines and decreased drilling and completion activity.\nYear ended December 31, 2018. Segment adjusted EBITDA decreased $0.1 million during 2018, compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting:\nFor additional information, see Notes 2, 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operational metrics to analyze our consolidated and segment performance. We view these metrics as important factors in evaluating our profitability and determining the amounts of cash distributions to pay to our unitholders. These metrics include:\nWe seek to maximize the profitability of our operations in part by minimizing, to the extent appropriate, expenses directly tied to operating our assets. Direct labor costs, compression costs, ad valorem taxes, repair and\nOther revenues. Revenue earned primarily from (i) certain costs for which certain of our customers have agreed to reimburse us and (ii) connection fees for customers of the Polar and Divide system.\nWe report volumes gathered for natural gas in cubic feet per day. We aggregate crude oil and produced water gathering and report volumes gathered in barrels per day.\nVolumes - Liquids. Crude oil and produced water throughput volumes at the Williston segment increased 19.7 Mbbl/d during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting well completion activity behind our Polar and Divide system in the second half of 2017 and in 2018 as well as the addition of new customers in 2017 and 2018.\n \u2022 Legacy Areas - production basins in which we expect our gathering systems to experience relatively lower long-term growth compared to our Core Focus Areas, given that our customers require relatively higher commodity prices to support drilling and completion activities in these basins. Upstream production served by our gathering systems in our Legacy Areas is generally more mature, as compared to our Core Focus Areas, and the decline rates for volume throughput on our gathering systems in the Legacy Areas are typically lower as a result. We expect to continue to moderate our near-term capital expenditures in these Legacy Areas. Our Piceance Basin, Barnett Shale and Marcellus Shale reportable segments (as described below) comprise our Legacy Areas. \nOther items to note:\nThe following transaction was executed pursuant thereto:\n \u2022 Grand River, a natural gas gathering and processing system located in the Piceance Basin, which includes the Mesaverde formation and the Mancos and Niobrara shale formations in western Colorado and eastern Utah; \n\nGathering services and related fees. Revenue earned from the gathering, compression, treating and processing services that we provide to our customers.\n \u2022 Shifts in operating costs and inflation. \nGeneral and administrative expense increased $2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting an increase in salaries and benefits as a result of increased headcount. For additional information, see the \"Corporate and Other Overview of the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016\" sections herein.\n \u2022 the Utica Shale, which is served by Summit Utica; \n \u2022 the Barnett Shale, which is served by DFW Midstream; and \n \u2022 a $63.7 million increase in natural gas, NGLs and condensate purchases primarily driven by increased natural gas, NGL and crude oil marketing activity for the Piceance Basin, DJ Basin, Barnett Shale and Williston Basin segments. \n\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\n \u2022 In March 2017, we recognized $37.7 million of gathering services and related fees revenue that had been previously deferred, and recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred revenue, in connection with an MVC arrangement with a certain Williston Basin customer, for which we determined we had no further performance obligations. We include the effect of adjustments related to MVC shortfall payments in our definition of segment adjusted EBITDA. As such, the Williston Basin segment adjusted EBITDA was not impacted because the revenue recognition was offset by the associated adjustments related to MVC shortfall payments for this customer. \nOther items to note:\n \u2022 the attractiveness of capital projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities; and \n \u2022 $25.5 million of capital contributions to Ohio Gathering. \nSee Notes 2 and 7 for additional information.\n \u2022 a $2.2 million increase in operation and maintenance expense primarily due to the increase in rights-of-way maintenance, the addition of leasing compression services and increase in direct labor costs. \nThe foregoing list of risks and uncertainties may not contain all of the risks and uncertainties that could affect us. In addition, in light of these risks and uncertainties, the matters referred to in the forward-looking statements contained in this document may not in fact occur. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on these statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law.\n \u2022 $4.9 million of capital contributions to Ohio Gathering. \nAs a result, we must continually obtain new supplies of production to maintain or increase the throughput volume on our systems. Our ability to maintain or increase throughput volumes from existing customers and obtain new supplies of throughput is impacted by:\nYear ended December 31, 2017. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $4.7 million during 2017, compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting:\nDeferred Purchase Price Obligation. Represents the change in fair value associated with the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation.\nCertain of our gathering and processing agreements contain MVCs pursuant to which our customers agree to ship or process a minimum volume of production on our gathering systems, or, in some cases, to pay a minimum monetary amount, over certain periods during the term of the MVC. These MVCs help us generate stable revenues and serve to mitigate the financial impact associated with declining volumes.\nVolume throughput decreased during 2018 due to natural declines from existing wells on pad sites connected to the Summit Utica system together with temporary production curtailments associated with infill drilling and completion activity from customers on existing pad sites, partially offset by the completion of new wells during 2017 and in 2018. In addition, the TPL-7 connector project was commissioned in the first quarter of 2017 which partially offset volume declines in 2018 due to a full year of operations.\nThe Deferred Purchase Price Obligation recognized in 2016 relates to our 2016 Drop Down transaction and the issuance of the Deferred Payment in connection with the 2016 Drop Down (see Notes 2 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements).\n \u2022 a $1.7 million decrease in operation and maintenance expense primarily from $1.3 million of lower electricity expenses associated with lower volume throughput and a decrease in tax expenses. \n \u2022 Production from U.S. shale plays; \nThe table below summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018.\nThe estimates that we deem to be most critical to an understanding of our financial position and results of operations are those related to determination of fair value and recognition of deferred revenue. The preparation and evaluation of these critical accounting estimates involve the use of various assumptions developed from management's analyses and judgments. Subsequent experience or use of other methods, estimates or assumptions could produce significantly different results. Our critical accounting estimates are as follows:\n \u2022 actions or inactions taken or nonperformance by third parties, including suppliers, contractors, operators, processors, transporters and customers, including the inability or failure of our shipper customers to meet their financial obligations under our gathering agreements and our ability to enforce the terms and conditions of certain of our gathering agreements in the event of a bankruptcy of one or more of our customers; \nVolume throughput for the Ohio Gathering system in 2018 increased slightly over the prior period as a result of increased drilling activity from our customers during the second half of 2017 and in 2018, partially offset by natural production declines on existing wells on the system.\n \u2022 In November 2018, a subsidiary of SMLP purchased the remaining 1% ownership interest in OpCo held by a subsidiary of Summit Investments for approximately $10.9 million. As a result of this transaction, other than our investment in Ohio Gathering, all of our business activities are now conducted through wholly owned operating subsidiaries. \n \u2022 a $14.6 million increase for the Utica Shale segment due to the ongoing development of the Summit Utica system, including the commissioning of the TPL-7 connector project in late March 2017. \nOverview\n \u2022 The decrease in the cost of natural gas and NGLs includes a $13.3 million reduction in expense due to the reclassification of amounts under certain percent-of-proceeds arrangements previously recognized in gathering services and related fees under Topic 606 (see Note 3 in the consolidated financial statements). \nCapital markets availability and cost of capital. Credit markets were volatile throughout 2018, as borrowing costs increased and investors assessed the impact of rising rates on broader economic activity. The Federal Reserve\nYear ended December 31, 2016. The following items are reflected in our financial results:\nCrude oil and produced water throughput volumes at the Williston segment decreased 13.7 Mbbl/d during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting natural production declines and decreased drilling and completion activity.\nPiceance Basin. The Grand River system provides midstream services for the Piceance Basin reportable segment. Volume throughput for our Piceance Basin reportable segment follows.\nConsolidated Overview for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016\nDeferred Purchase Price Obligation. Deferred Purchase Price Obligation recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018 represents the change in present value of the estimated Remaining Consideration to be paid in connection with the 2016 Drop Down (see Notes 17 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements). The change was primarily due to the passage of time and an associated decrease in the discount rate, partially offset by the continued slowing and deferral of drilling and completion activities to periods outside of the DPPO measurement period.\n \u2022 a $3.8 million increase in operation and maintenance expense primarily due to planned compressor overhaul maintenance costs during the period. \n \u2022 a $6.8 million decrease in cash interest payments due to the extinguishment of the 7.5% Senior Notes in the first quarter of 2017; \n \u2022 a $10.6 million decrease for the Barnett Shale segment largely as a result of natural production declines and reduced drilling activity on the DFW Midstream system. \nThe increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior period, was primarily driven by the interest associated with issuance of the $500.0 million principal 5.75% Senior Notes and an increase in the interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility. These increases were partially offset by (i) the tender and redemption of the $300.0 million principal 7.5% Senior Notes, (ii) a lower outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility and (iii) the issuance of 300,000 Series A Preferred Units in November 2017 whereby the net proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nOur ability to grow, or even maintain current, cash distributions depends, in part, on our ability to capitalize on organic growth opportunities and make acquisitions that increase the amount of cash generated from our operations on a per-unit basis, along with other factors.\n \u2022 the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; \n \u2022 a $3.6 million decrease in gathering services and related fees for the Barnett Shale segment largely as a result of the expiration of an MVC during 2017. \n \u2022 a volume throughput decrease of 14 MMcf/d for the Barnett Shale segment. \n \u2022 Forward-Looking Statements \nCash flows used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily reflected:\nResults of Operations\n \u2022 a $9.5 million decrease for the Williston Basin segment primarily due to natural production declines and reduced drilling and completion activity on the Polar and Divide system. \n \u2022 estimates of (i) capital expenditures made between the respective balance sheet date and December 31, 2019 and (ii) Business Adjusted EBITDA, an income-based measure, during the period from the respective balance sheet date to December 31, 2019. The calculation of the prospective component of Remaining Consideration represents management's best estimate of these two financial measures. \nWe estimate expected MVC shortfall payments based on assumptions including, but not limited to, contract terms, historical volume throughput data and expectations regarding future investment, drilling and production.\n \u2022 $125.2 million of net proceeds from the issuance of common units in September 2016. \nIncome or loss from equity method investees. Represents the income or loss associated with our ownership interest in Ohio Gathering.\n \u2022 increase of cash receipts due to higher revenues and associated customer payments; \n(4) Reflects proceeds from the issuance of Series A preferred units.\n \u2022 restrictions placed on us by the agreements governing our debt and preferred equity instruments; \n*Not considered meaningful\n2018, 2017 and 2016 Impairment Evaluations. We performed our 2018, 2017 and 2016 annual goodwill impairment analysis as of September 30 and concluded that none of our goodwill had been impaired.\n \u2022 a volume throughput decrease of 28 MMcf/d for the Marcellus Shale segment. \nDebt\nJuly 2014 Shelf Registration Statement. In July 2014, we filed the 2014 SRS with the SEC to issue an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities and shortly thereafter completed a public offering of $300.0 million aggregate principal 5.5% senior unsecured notes due 2022. We used the proceeds to repay a portion of the then-outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nWe have exposure due to nonperformance under our MVC contracts whereby a customer, who was not meeting its MVCs, does not have the wherewithal to make its MVC shortfall payments when they become due. We typically receive payment for all prior-year MVC shortfall billings in the quarter immediately following billing. Therefore, our exposure to risk of nonperformance is limited to and accumulates during the current year-to-date contracted measurement period.\n \u2022 our inclusion of expected annual or multi-year MVC shortfall payments. With respect to the impact of a net change in deferred revenue for MVC shortfall payments, we treated increases in deferred revenue balances as a favorable adjustment to segment adjusted EBITDA, while decreases in deferred revenue balances were treated as an unfavorable adjustment to segment adjusted EBITDA. We also included a proportional amount of any historical and expected MVC shortfall payments in each quarter prior to the quarter in which we actually recognized the shortfall payment. \nInterest expense. Interest expense associated with our Revolving Credit Facility and our Senior Notes as well as amortization expense associated with debt issuance costs.\n system and temporary production curtailments. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in volume throughput associated with new wells completed in 2017 and 2018. \n \u2022 our ability to gather, treat and/or process production that has been released from commitments with our competitors. \nFinancial data for our Permian Basin reportable segment follows.\nYear ended December 31, 2017. Segment adjusted EBITDA decreased $8.4 million during 2017, compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting:\n \u2022 In December 2017, in connection with certain strategic initiatives, we performed a financial review of certain assets within the Williston Basin reporting segment. This resulted in a triggering event that required us to perform a recoverability test. Based on the results of the test, we concluded that the carrying value of certain intangible and long-lived assets related to the Bison Midstream system in the Williston Basin were not fully recoverable and we recorded an impairment charge of $187.1 million. \n \u2022 Trends and Outlook \n \u2022 In February 2017, we completed a secondary public offering of 4,000,000 SMLP common units held by a subsidiary of Summit Investments in accordance with our obligations under our Partnership Agreement. We did not receive any proceeds from this secondary offering. \n \u2022 a $13.3 million decrease in gathering services and related fees for the Williston Basin segment due to the reclassification of amounts under certain percent-of-proceeds arrangements currently recognized on a net basis in cost of natural gas and NGLs under Topic 606 (see Note 3 in the consolidated financial statements). \n \u2022 the Permian Basin, which is served by Summit Permian; \nDeferred Purchase Price Obligation\n \u2022 a $3.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily driven by an increase in assets placed into service in the Summit Utica system. \nThe components of the net change in cash and cash equivalents were as follows:\nnon-capitalized maintenance costs, integrity management costs, utilities and contract services comprise the most significant portion of our operation and maintenance expense. Other than utilities expense, these expenses are largely independent of volumes delivered through our gathering systems but may fluctuate depending on the activities performed during a specific period.\nFinancing activities. Details of cash flows from financing activities follow.\nDeveloping, owning and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets requires significant investment in the maintenance of existing gathering systems and the construction and development of new gathering systems and other midstream assets and facilities.\nOur expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about, or interpretations of, available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.\nFinancial data for our Utica Shale reportable segment follows.\n \u2022 the recognition of $37.7 million of previously deferred revenue related to a certain Williston Basin customer. \nFinancial data for our Piceance Basin reportable segment follows.\n \u2022 $316.0 million of net borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, which included $360.0 million of borrowings to fund the 2016 Drop Down and reflected a repayment in September 2016 with funds from the issuance of common units noted below; \nCost of natural gas and NGLs increased $29.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting:\n \u2022 competitive conditions in our industry and their impact on our ability to connect hydrocarbon supplies to our gathering and processing assets or systems; \nOperation and maintenance. Operation and maintenance primarily comprises direct labor costs, compression costs, ad valorem taxes, repair and non-capitalized maintenance costs, integrity management costs, utilities and contract services. These items represent the most significant portion of our operation and maintenance expense. Other than utilities expense, these expenses are largely independent of variations in throughput volumes but may fluctuate depending on the activities performed during a specific period.\nCash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily reflected:\n \u2022 a $66.4 million increase in natural gas, NGLs and condensate sales primarily attributable to increased natural gas and/or crude oil marketing activity for the Piceance Basin, DJ Basin, Barnett Shale and Williston Basin segments. \n \u2022 a volume throughput decrease of 52 MMcf/d for the Barnett Shale segment. \nRevenues. Total revenues increased $17.9 million, during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting:\n\nInterest Expense. The decrease in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior period, was as a result of (i) the tender and redemption of the $300.0 million principal 7.5% Senior Notes, (ii) the issuance of 300,000 Series A Preferred Units in November 2017 whereby the net proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and (iii) a lower average outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility. The decrease was partially offset by the interest associated with issuance of the $500.0 million principal 5.75% Senior Notes and an increase in the interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility.\n\n(1) Reflects cash and noncash consideration, including working capital and capital expenditure adjustments paid (received), for acquisitions and/or drop downs (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements).\nCapital Requirements\nCost of natural gas and NGLs. The cost of natural gas and NGLs represents (i) the purchase of natural gas and NGLs associated with marketing activity surrounding certain of our natural gas and crude oil-related operations and (ii) the costs associated with the percent-of-proceeds arrangements under which we sell natural gas and NGLs purchased from certain of our customers on the Bison Midstream and Grand River systems.\nIn 2017, we updated the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation based on management's estimate of forecasted Business Adjusted EBITDA and capital expenditures for the 2016 Drop Down Assets. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower expected Business Adjusted EBITDA in 2018 and 2019 associated with the 2016 Drop Down Assets partially offset by lower estimated capital expenditures. The revision in estimated Business Adjusted EBITDA and estimated capital expenditures reflects a slower expected pace of drilling and completion activities from our customers, particularly in the Utica Shale in 2018 and 2019. As of December 31, 2017, we estimated the undiscounted future value of the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation to be approximately $454.4 million. As a result of revisions in these estimates, the estimated undiscounted future payment obligation decreased by $375.9 million relative to the estimate as of December 31, 2016. The revised estimates had a favorable impact on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 (see Notes 2 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements).\nDeferred Purchase Price Obligation\nOur long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, amortizing intangible assets and goodwill.\n \u2022 a $13.6 million increase in natural gas, NGLs and condensate sales attributable to the impact of higher comparative commodity pricing in the Williston Basin, Piceance Basin and DJ Basin segments. \n shortfall in a contract with no banking mechanism or claw back provision; (iii) the customer's banking mechanism has expired; or (iv) it is remote that the customer will use its unexercised right. \n \u2022 a $4.3 million increase in gathering services and related fees primarily as a result of higher volumes generated by increased drilling and completion activity. \n \u2022 a $19.3 million increase in cost of natural gas and NGLs driven by higher natural gas marketing volumes due to increased marketing activity surrounding our natural gas-related operations and the impact of higher comparative commodity pricing. \nOperation and maintenance expense decreased $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior period primarily due to a decrease in expenses that we pass through to our customers. The decrease was primarily a result of lower volume throughput in the Williston Basin and Barnett Shale segments.\n at-the-market offerings as defined by SEC rules. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we did not issue any units under the ATM Program. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we issued 763,548 units under the ATM Program for aggregate gross proceeds of $17.7 million, and paid approximately $0.2 million as compensation to the sales agents pursuant to the terms of the equity distribution agreement. Our General Partner made capital contributions to maintain its approximate 2% General Partner interest in SMLP. Following the effectiveness of the new ATM registration statement and after taking into account the aggregate sales price of common units sold under the ATM Program through December 31, 2018, we have the capacity to issue additional common units under the ATM Program up to an aggregate $132.3 million. \nFinancial data for our Barnett Shale reportable segment follows.\nLiquids. The increase in liquids volume throughput during 2018 primarily reflected well completion activity by existing customers on our Polar and Divide system in the second half of 2017 and in 2018 as well as the addition of new customers.\nWe examine the creditworthiness of counterparties to whom we extend credit and manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, credit approval, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and for certain transactions, we may request letters of credit, prepayments or guarantees.\nFor additional information on our organization and systems, see Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\n2017 Impairments. In December 2017, in connection with certain strategic initiatives, we performed a financial review of certain assets within the Williston Basin reporting segment. This resulted in a triggering event that required us to perform a recoverability test. Based on the results of the test, we concluded that the carrying value of certain long-lived assets and the related intangible assets related to the Bison Midstream system in the Williston Basin were not fully recoverable. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $101.9 million related to the long-lived assets and $85.2 million related to contract intangibles assets.\n \u2022 the impact of the 2017 recognition of $187.1 million of certain intangible and long-lived asset impairments relating to the Bison Midstream system in the Williston Basin segment. \n \u2022 Ohio Gathering, which includes our ownership interest in OGC and OCC; \n \u2022 the recognition of $2.6 million of business interruption recoveries for the Williston Basin segment. \n* Not considered meaningful\n \u2022 revenues; \nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Amortizing Intangible Assets. As of December 31, 2018, we had net property, plant and equipment with a carrying value of approximately $2.0 billion and net amortizing intangible assets with a carrying value of approximately $273.4 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n \u2022 a $19.3 million increase in purchases associated with our natural gas and crude oil marketing services and an increase due to higher comparative commodity pricing and throughput of NGLs on our Williston Basin and Piceance Basin segments and the associated impact on (i) our percent-of-proceeds arrangements for the Bison Midstream system and (ii) our percent-of-proceeds arrangements and condensate sales for the Grand River system. \n \u2022 Increased natural gas, NGLs and condensate sales and cost of natural gas and NGLs associated with increased marketing related activities. \n(3) Reflects proceeds from underwritten primary offerings.\nOperation and Maintenance Expenses\n* Not considered meaningful\n \u2022 the extent and success of our customers' drilling efforts, as well as the quantity of natural gas, crude oil and produced water volumes produced within proximity of our assets; \n \u2022 other changes in working capital. \n \u2022 a $4.8 million decrease in distributions from Ohio Gathering. \n\n2018 Impairments. In December 2018, in connection with certain strategic initiatives, we performed a recoverability assessment of certain assets within the Williston Basin reporting segment. Based on the results, we concluded that the carrying value of certain long-lived assets related to the Tioga Midstream system within the Williston Basin were not fully recoverable. We recorded an impairment charge of $3.9 million related to these assets after comparing the fair value of the long-lived assets to their carrying values. In addition, we reviewed other assets that had been identified as potentially impaired and recognized long-lived asset impairments as detailed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 commercial bank and capital market conditions and the potential impact of changes or disruptions in the credit and/or equity capital markets; \n \u2022 any other issues that can result in deficiencies in the design, installation or operation of our gathering, treating and processing facilities; \nNatural gas, NGLs and condensate sales. Revenue earned from (i) the sale of physical natural gas and/or NGLs purchased under percentage-of-proceeds arrangements with certain of our customers on the Bison Midstream and Grand River systems, (ii) natural gas and crude oil marketing services in and around our gathering systems, (iii) the sale of natural gas we retain from certain DFW Midstream customers and (iv) the sale of condensate we retain from our gathering services at Grand River.\nGoodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually on September 30 and whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill.\nForward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are inherently subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of our management team. All forward-looking statements in this report and subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or to persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements in this paragraph. These risks and uncertainties include, among others:\n* Not considered meaningful\n \u2022 $181.5 million of distributions paid; \nWith respect to property, plant and equipment and our amortizing intangible assets, the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if the carrying value exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the asset's use and eventual disposal. In this situation, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the asset's fair value. We determine fair value using an income-based approach in which we discount the asset's expected future cash flows to reflect the risk associated with achieving the underlying cash flows. Any impairment determinations involve significant assumptions and judgments. Differing assumptions regarding any of these inputs could have a significant effect on the various valuations. As such, the fair value measurements utilized within these estimates are classified as non-recurring Level 3 measurements in the fair value hierarchy because they are not observable from objective sources. Due to the volatility of the inputs used, we cannot predict the likelihood of any future impairment.\nVolume throughput declined during 2018 reflecting natural production declines, partially offset by new volumes from completion activity during the fourth quarter of 2017, first quarter of 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2018.\n \u2022 Capital markets activity and cost of capital; and \nIn February 2017, we issued $500.0 million principal of 5.75% senior, unsecured notes due 2025. We used the proceeds from the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes to (i) fund the repurchase of the outstanding $300.0 million principal 7.5% Senior Notes, (ii) pay redemption and call premiums on the 7.5% Senior Notes totaling $17.9 million and (iii) pay $172.0 million of the balance outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nEarly Extinguishment of Debt. The early extinguishment of debt recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven by the tender and redemption of the $300.0 million principal amount of 7.5% Senior Notes.\nCost of Natural Gas and NGLs. Cost of natural gas and NGLs increased $50.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting:\n \u2022 Critical Accounting Estimates \n \u2022 the impact of the 2017 recognition of $37.7 million of previously deferred revenue related to a certain Williston Basin customer. \nNatural gas throughput volumes increased 220 MMcf/d during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to prior year, primarily reflected:\nWe also have indirect exposure to changes in commodity prices in that persistently low commodity prices may cause our customers to delay and/or cancel drilling and/or completion activities or temporarily shut-in production, which would reduce the volumes of natural gas and crude oil (and associated volumes of produced water) that we gather. If certain of our customers cancel or delay drilling and/or completion activities or temporarily shut-in production, the associated MVCs, if any, ensure that we will earn a minimum amount of revenue.\nUtica Shale. The Utica Shale reportable segment includes the Summit Utica system. Volume throughput for our Summit Utica system follows.\nTotal revenues increased $86.4 million, during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year, primarily reflected:\n \u2022 a $8.4 million decrease in depreciation and amortization primarily due to the impairment of certain intangible and long-lived assets relating to the Bison Midstream system in the Williston Basin segment recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017. \n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $6.0 million in gathering services and related fees from MVC shortfall adjustments. Under Topic 606, we recognize customer obligations under their MVCs as revenue and contract assets when (i) we consider it remote that the customer will utilize shortfall payments to offset gathering or processing fees in excess of its MVCs in subsequent periods; (ii) the customer incurs a \n(2) See Notes 17 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements and Business - Recent Developments\u201d.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\n \u2022 Summit Permian, an associated natural gas gathering and processing system in the northern Delaware Basin, which includes the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring formations, in southeastern New Mexico. \nFollowing the February 2017 secondary offering, we can issue up to $1.50 billion of debt and equity securities in primary offerings and a total of 32,701,230 common units held by (i) a subsidiary of Summit Investments and (ii) affiliates of our Sponsor pursuant to the 2016 SRS. The 2016 SRS expires in November 2019.\n \u2022 a decrease in distributions from equity method investees; and \nYear ended December 31, 2018. Segment adjusted EBITDA decreased $3.7 million during 2018, compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting:\nOperation and Maintenance. Operation and maintenance expense increased $3.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior period, primarily due to an increase in planned compressor overhaul maintenance.\n \u2022 the recognition of $37.7 million of previously deferred revenue related to a certain Williston Basin customer. \nVolume throughput increased during 2017 due to the ongoing development of the system and completion of new wells during 2017. In addition, the TPL-7 connector project contributed to increased volumes.\n \u2022 a $3.7 million decrease in gathering services and related fees from a lower gathering rate mix associated with increasing volumes from the TPL-7 connector project, which was commissioned in the first quarter of 2017, along with a decrease in volume throughput from wells that we gather from pad sites on the Summit Utica \nFinancial data for our Williston Basin reportable segment follows.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n \u2022 the reclassification of $13.3 million in cost of natural gas and NGLs for the Williston Basin segment under certain percent-of-proceeds arrangements previously recognized in gathering services and related fees, which is presented net in cost of natural gas and NGLs under Topic 606. \n(1) Includes the amortization expense associated with our favorable and unfavorable gas gathering contracts as reported in other revenues.\nCertain of our customers may be temporarily unable to meet their current obligations. While this may cause disruption to cash flows, we believe that we are properly positioned to deal with the potential disruption because the vast majority of our gathering assets are strategically positioned at the beginning of the midstream value chain. The majority of our infrastructure is connected directly to our customers' wellheads and pad sites, which means our gathering systems are typically the first third-party infrastructure through which our customers' commodities flow and, in many cases, the only way for our customers to get their production to market.\n \u2022 the Marcellus Shale, which is served by Mountaineer Midstream. \nCash flows used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily reflected:\n \u2022 a $4.3 million decrease, after taking into account the adjustments related to MVC shortfall payments and adjustments related to capital reimbursement activity, in gathering services and related fees associated with the expiration of MVCs during 2017 of $3.6 million in addition to lower volume throughput. \n \u2022 fluctuations in natural gas, NGLs and crude oil prices; \n \u2022 a $13.3 million decrease in the cost of natural gas and NGLs for the Williston Basin segment due to the reclassification of amounts under certain percent-of-proceeds arrangements under Topic 606 that were previously recognized in gathering services and related fees. \nNatural Gas, NGLs and Condensate Sales. Natural gas, NGLs and condensate sales increased $66.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting the addition of natural gas, NGL and crude oil marketing services provided for the Piceance Basin, DJ Basin, Barnett Shale and Williston Basin segments.\n \u2022 a $3.0 million increase in operation and maintenance expense primarily due to planned compressor overhaul maintenance. \n\n \u2022 $293.2 million of net proceeds from the issuance of Series A Preferred units in November 2017. \n* Not considered meaningful\n \u2022 Niobrara G&P, an associated natural gas gathering and processing system operating in the DJ Basin, which includes the Niobrara and Codell shale formations in northeastern Colorado; and \nOur business has been, and we expect our future business to continue to be, affected by the following key trends:\nYear ended December 31, 2017. Segment adjusted EBITDA decreased $13.1 million during 2017, compared to the prior period primarily reflecting:\n \u2022 $205.0 million of net borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. \n \u2022 In February 2017, we completed a public offering of $500.0 million principal amount of 5.75% Senior Notes. Concurrent with and following the offering, we initiated a tender offer for the outstanding 7.5% Senior Notes. All remaining 7.5% Senior Notes were redeemed on March 18, 2017, with payment made on March 20, 2017. We used the proceeds from the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes to (i) fund the repurchase of the outstanding $300.0 million principal amount of 7.5% Senior Notes, (ii) pay redemption and call premiums on the 7.5% Senior Notes totaling $17.9 million and (iii) pay $172.0 million of the balance outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. \nVolume throughput increased during 2018 and 2017, compared to the prior periods, primarily as a result of ongoing drilling and completion activity across our service area.\n \u2022 a $0.4 million decrease in operation and maintenance expense primarily as a result of higher expenses incurred in 2016 associated with repairs to rights-of-way. \n \u2022 In September 2016, we completed an underwritten public offering of 5,500,000 common units at a price of $23.20 per unit and used the net proceeds to pay down our Revolving Credit Facility. Following the offering, our General Partner made a capital contribution to us to maintain its approximate 2% general partner interest. \nThe increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior period, was primarily driven by the interest associated with issuance of the $500.0 million principal 5.75% Senior Notes and an increase in the interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility. These increases were partially offset by (i) the tender and redemption of the $300.0 million principal 7.5% Senior Notes, (ii) a lower outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility and (iii) the issuance of 300,000 Series A Preferred Units in November 2017 whereby the net proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nWe recognized the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation to reflect the present value of the Remaining Consideration. Our calculation of the Remaining Consideration incorporates:\nWe classify our midstream energy infrastructure assets into two categories:\n \u2022 the effects of litigation; \n \u2022 the level of work-overs and recompletions of wells on existing pad sites to which our gathering systems are connected; \nNatural gas. Natural gas volume throughput decreased during 2018 and 2017, primarily reflecting natural production declines.\nWe classify deferred revenue as a current liability for arrangements where the expiration of a customer's right to utilize shortfall payments is twelve months or less. We classify deferred revenue as noncurrent for arrangements where the expiration of the right to utilize shortfall payments and our estimate of its potential utilization is more than 12 months. As of December 31, 2018, current deferred revenue totaled $11.5 million. Noncurrent deferred revenue totaled $39.5\n \u2022 How We Evaluate Our Operations \n \u2022 $209.2 million of distributions paid; and \nThe acquisition component and greenfield development projects of our growth strategy has required and will continue to require significant expenditures by us. Consequently, our ability to develop and maintain sources of funds to meet our capital requirements is critical to our ability to meet our growth objectives. We intend to continue to pursue accretive acquisitions of midstream assets from third parties. However, their size, timing and/or contribution to our operations and financial results cannot be reasonably estimated. Furthermore, there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our current expectations to change, including, but not limited to, (i) the ability to reach agreement with third parties; (ii) prevailing conditions and outlook in the natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids industries and markets and (iii) our ability to obtain financing from commercial banks, the capital markets, or other sources such as our Sponsor and Summit Investments, among other factors.\nVolumes - Gas. Natural gas throughput volumes decreased 75 MMcf/d during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting:\nThe estimates and expectations used in calculating the prospective component of Remaining Consideration and the present value calculation of the Remaining Consideration involve a significant amount of judgment as the calculations are, in part, based on future events and/or conditions, including (i) revenues, (ii) estimates of future volume throughput, capital expenditures, operating costs and their timing and (iii) economic and regulatory climates, among other factors. Our estimates of these inputs are inherently imprecise because they reflect our expectation of future conditions that are largely outside of our control. While the assumptions used are consistent with our current business plans and investment decisions, these assumptions could change significantly during the period leading up to settlement of the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation. See Notes 17 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements and Business - Recent Developments\u201d for additional information.\nOur financial results are recognized as follows:\n \u2022 a $1.5 million decrease in general and administrative expenses. \n \u2022 the recognition of $2.6 million of business interruption recoveries for the Williston Basin segment. \n(3) Represents agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding.\n \u2022 an $8.5 million increase in cash interest payments; and \nThe following table presents certain consolidated and reportable segment financial data.

In October 2016, we filed the 2016 SRS and in November 2016, the SEC declared it effective. The following transactions have been executed pursuant thereto:\nYear ended December 31, 2017. The following items are reflected in our financial results:\n \u2022 a volume throughput increase of 179 MMcf/d for the Utica Shale segment. \nTrends and Outlook\n \u2022 our ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells in the areas in which we operate outside of our existing AMIs; and \nMD&A is intended to inform the reader about matters affecting the financial condition and results of operations of SMLP and its subsidiaries. As a result, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this report. Among other things, the consolidated financial statements and the related notes include more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following information. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that constitute our plans, estimates and beliefs. These forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those discussed in Forward-Looking Statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\nraised its benchmark federal-funds rate from a range of 1.25% and 1.50% in December 2017 to a range between 2.25% and 2.50% in December 2018. The Federal Reserve may continue to raise interest rates in the future, to the extent that economic growth continues. Capital markets conditions, including but not limited to availability and higher borrowing costs, could affect our ability to access the debt capital markets to the extent necessary to fund our future growth. Furthermore, market demand for equity issued by master limited partnerships has been significantly lower in recent years than it has been historically, which may make it more challenging for us to finance our expansion capital expenditures and acquisition capital expenditures with the issuance of additional equity. We recently announced a planned reduction in our common unit distribution to $0.2875 per quarter, beginning with the distribution to be paid in respect of the first quarter of 2019, and this reduction may further reduce demand for our common units. In addition, interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly. Although this could limit our ability to raise debt capital on acceptable terms, we expect to remain competitive with respect to acquisitions and capital projects, as our peers and competitors would likely face similar circumstances.\nSenior Notes. In June 2013, the Co-Issuers co-issued the 7.5% Senior Notes, and in July 2014, the Co-Issuers co-issued the 5.5% Senior Notes. In February 2017, the Co-Issuers co-issued the 5.75% Senior Notes. The 7.5% Senior Notes were tendered and redeemed during the first quarter of 2017. There were no defaults or events of default during 2018 on any series of senior notes.\nDeferred Revenue. We record customer billings for obligations under their MVCs as deferred revenue when the customer has the right to utilize shortfall payments to offset gathering or processing fees in subsequent periods. We recognize deferred revenue under these arrangements in revenue when (i) we consider it remote that the customer will utilize shortfall payments to offset gathering or processing fees in excess of its MVCs in subsequent periods; (ii) the customer incurs a shortfall in a contract with no banking mechanism or claw back provision; (iii) the customer's banking mechanism has expired; or (iv) it is remote that the customer will use its unexercised right. We also recognize deferred revenue when it is determined that a given amount of MVC shortfall payments cannot be recovered by offsetting gathering or processing fees in subsequent contracted measurement periods. In making this determination, we consider both quantitative and qualitative facts and circumstances, including, but not limited to, contract terms, capacity of the associated pipeline or receipt point and/or expectations regarding future investment, drilling and production.\n \u2022 Mountaineer Midstream, a natural gas gathering system operating in the Appalachian Basin, which includes the Marcellus Shale formation in northern West Virginia. \n \u2022 In 2018, the present value of the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation increased by $21.0 million. The change was primarily due to the passage of time and an associated decrease in the discount rate, partially offset by the continued slowing and deferral of drilling and completion activities to periods outside of the DPPO measurement period (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements). \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization decreased during 2018 largely as a result of the long-lived asset impairment recognized in 2017. \nIn 2017, we updated the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation based on management's estimate of forecasted Business Adjusted EBITDA and capital expenditures for the 2016 Drop Down Assets. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower expected Business Adjusted EBITDA in 2018 and 2019 associated with the 2016 Drop Down Assets, partially offset by lower estimated capital expenditures. The revision in estimated Business Adjusted EBITDA and estimated capital expenditures reflects a slower expected pace of drilling and completion activities from our customers, particularly in the Utica Shale in 2018 and 2019. As of December 31, 2017, we estimated the undiscounted future value of the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation to be approximately $454.4 million. As a result of revisions in these estimates, the estimated undiscounted future payment obligation decreased by $375.9 million relative to the estimate as of December 31, 2016. The revised estimates had a favorable impact on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\n \u2022 Results of Operations \n \u2022 $167.5 million of distributions paid in 2016; and \nCash flows used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily reflected:\n \u2022 a $1.2 million decrease in operation and maintenance expense primarily due to declines in expenses for repairs to right-of-way of $0.9 million and lower property taxes of $0.7 million during the period. \nWe are the owner-operator of the following gathering systems, which comprise our Legacy Areas:\n \u2022 operational risks and hazards inherent in the gathering, treating and/or processing of natural gas, crude oil and produced water; \nFinancial data for our DJ Basin reportable segment follows.\n\n \u2022 a $63.7 million increase in natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate purchases driven by increased natural gas, NGL and crude oil marketing activity for the Piceance Basin, DJ Basin, Barnett Shale and Williston Basin segments. \n \u2022 a $22.9 million increase in natural gas, NGLs and condensate sales attributable to increased marketing activity surrounding our natural gas-related operations and the impact of higher comparative commodity pricing. \nWilliston Basin. The Polar and Divide, Tioga Midstream and Bison Midstream systems provide our midstream services for the Williston Basin reportable segment. Volume throughput for our Williston Basin reportable segment follows.\nFor additional information on volumes, see the \"Segment Overview for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016\" section herein.\nWe conduct and report our operations in the midstream energy industry through eight reportable segments. We evaluate our business operations each reporting period to determine whether any of our operating segments in which we internally report financial information are considered significant and would require us to separately disclose certain segment financial information in our external reporting. As a result of our evaluation, during the fourth quarter of 2018, we determined that the DJ Basin natural gas gathering and processing system, previously reported within the Piceance/DJ Basins reportable segment, is expected to be a significant operating segment in future reporting periods. This determination was based on, among other things, the development of a new 60 MMcf/d processing plant that is expected to be operational in 2019, which will increase volume throughput beginning in 2019. In addition, we determined the Permian Basin natural gas gathering and processing system, which was commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2018, is expected to be a significant operating segment in future reporting periods. As such, we modified our current segments in the fourth quarter of 2018 such that the DJ Basin reportable segment includes the Niobrara G&P system and the Permian Basin reportable segment includes the Summit Permian natural gas gathering and processing system. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we have disclosed the required segment information for Niobrara G&P and Summit Permian and the periods prior have been recast to reflect this change. Our reportable segments are as follows:\n \u2022 Tioga Midstream, a crude oil, produced water and associated natural gas gathering system operating in the Williston Basin, which includes the Bakken and Three Forks shale formations in northwestern North Dakota; \nGross volume throughput for Ohio Gathering, based on a one-month lag follows.\n \u2022 throughput volume; \n\n \u2022 a $10.6 million decrease in gathering services and related fees largely as a result of natural production declines and reduced drilling and completion activity. \n \u2022 The adjustments related to MVC shortfall payments for 2017 is primarily driven by the recognition of $37.7 million of gathering services and related fees revenue that had been previously deferred, and recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred revenue, in connection with an MVC arrangement with a certain Williston Basin customer, for which we determined we had no further performance obligations. As a result, the increase in gathering services and related fees compared with the first half of 2016 was offset by the change in adjustments related to MVC shortfall payments, with no impact on segment adjusted EBITDA. \n \u2022 a $13.3 million decrease in gathering services and related fees for the Williston Basin segment due to the reclassification of amounts under certain percent-of-proceeds arrangements currently recognized on a net basis in cost of natural gas and NGLs under Topic 606. \n \u2022 Core Focus Areas - production basins in which we expect our gathering systems to experience greater long-term growth, driven by our customers ability to generate more favorable returns and support sustained drilling and completion activity in varying commodity price environments. In the near-term, we expect to concentrate the majority of our capital expenditures in our Core Focus Areas. Our Utica Shale, Ohio Gathering, Williston Basin, DJ Basin and Permian Basin reportable segments (as described below) comprise our Core Focus Areas. \n\nWhen evidence exists that we will not be able to recover a long-lived asset's carrying value through future cash flows, we write down the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value. We test assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable as well as in connection with any goodwill impairment evaluations.\nYear ended December 31, 2017. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $13.0 million during 2017, compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting:\nOperating activities. Cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily reflected:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n___________\nInvesting activities. Details of cash flows from investing activities follow.\n \u2022 a $1.5 million increase in operation and maintenance expense primarily due to $1.1 million of higher electricity expenses we pass through to certain customers (which is also included in the increase in Other revenues in the table above) in addition to higher operation and maintenance costs to support volume growth. \nYear ended December 31, 2018. Segment adjusted EBITDA for equity method investees decreased $1.3 million during 2018, compared to the prior period, primarily as a result of higher expenses, partially offset by higher volumes at OGC and OCC.\n \u2022 Bison Midstream, an associated natural gas gathering system operating in the Williston Basin, which includes the Bakken and Three Forks shale formations in northwestern North Dakota; \n \u2022 operation and maintenance expenses; and \nNatural gas, NGLs and condensate sales increased $32.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting the addition of natural gas, NGL and crude oil marketing services provided for the Piceance Basin, DJ Basin and Barnett Shale segments and the impact of higher comparative commodity pricing and throughput of NGLs on our Williston Basin, Piceance Basin and DJ Basin segments.\nVolume throughput for our Barnett Shale reportable segment follows.\n \u2022 Summit Utica, a natural gas gathering system operating in the Appalachian Basin, which includes the Utica and Point Pleasant shale formations in southeastern Ohio; \nAdjustments for MVC Shortfall Payments. We estimate the impact of expected MVC shortfall payments for inclusion in our calculation of segment adjusted EBITDA. Adjustments related to MVC shortfall payments account for:\n\nVolume throughput decreased during 2018, compared to the prior period, primarily due to natural production declines. These declines were partially offset by volumes generated by the completion, in the second half of 2017 and first quarter of 2018, of a number of drilled but uncompleted ( DUC\u201d) wells.\nRevolving Credit Facility. We have a $1.25 billion senior secured Revolving Credit Facility. On May 26, 2017, Summit Holdings closed on the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement which extended the maturity from November 2018 to May 2022 (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements). As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding balance of the Revolving Credit Facility was $466.0 million and the unused portion totaled $784.0 million. There were no defaults or events of default during 2018, and as of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the financial covenants in the Revolving Credit Facility.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental financial measure used by management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others.\nCorporate and Other represents those results that are not specifically attributable to a reportable segment or that have not been allocated to our reportable segments, including certain general and administrative expense items, natural gas and crude oil marketing services, transaction costs, interest expense, early extinguishment of debt and a change in the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation fair value.\n \u2022 $31.6 million of capital contributions to Ohio Gathering. \n\n \u2022 a volume throughput decrease of 6 MMcf/d for the Utica Shale segment. \n \u2022 a volume throughput increase of 4 MMcf/d for the DJ Basin segment. \nFinancial data for our Ohio Gathering reportable segment, based on a one-month lag follows.\nYear ended December 31, 2018. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $0.9 million during 2018, compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting:\n \u2022 In December 2018, in connection with certain strategic initiatives, we performed a recoverability assessment of certain assets within the Williston Basin reporting segment. Based on the results, we concluded that the carrying value of certain long-lived assets related to the Tioga Midstream system in the Williston Basin were not fully recoverable and we recorded an impairment charge of $3.9 million. \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization increased over 2016, compared to the prior period, as a result of placing assets into service. \n \u2022 a volume throughput increase of 87 MMcf/d for the Marcellus Shale segment. \n \u2022 a volume throughput decrease of 31 MMcf/d for the Piceance Basin segment. \nContractual Obligations Update\n \u2022 the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to make cash distributions and support our indebtedness; \n \u2022 a $3.6 million decrease in gathering services and related fees for the Barnett Shale segment largely as a result of the expiration of an MVC during 2017. \nWe prepare our financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These principles are established by the FASB. We employ methods, estimates and assumptions based on currently available information when recording transactions resulting from business operations. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOhio Gathering. The Ohio Gathering reportable segment includes OGC and OCC. We account for our investment in Ohio Gathering using the equity method. We recognize our proportionate share of earnings or loss in net income on a one-month lag based on the financial information available to us during the reporting period.\n\n \u2022 In November 2017, we issued 300,000 Series A Preferred Units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership at a price of $1,000 per unit. We used the net proceeds of $293.2 million to repay outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. \nMinimum Volume Commitments\n \u2022 certain factors discussed elsewhere in this report. \n__________\nThe following table presents certain consolidated data and volume throughput for the years ended December 31.\nForward-Looking Statements\nWe then discount the Remaining Consideration using a commensurate risk-adjusted discount rate and recognize the present value on our consolidated balance sheets with the change in present value recognized in earnings in the period of change.\nGeneral and administrative. Expenses associated with our operations that are not specifically associated with the operation and maintenance of a particular system or another cost and expense line item. These expenses largely reflect salaries, benefits and incentive compensation, professional fees, insurance and rent.\n \u2022 a $4.3 million increase for the Marcellus Shale segment primarily as a result of higher volumes generated by increased drilling and completion activity. \nThe volume of (i) natural gas that we gather, compress, treat and/or process and (ii) crude oil and produced water that we gather depends on the level of production from natural gas or crude oil wells connected to our gathering systems. Aggregate production volumes are impacted by the overall amount of drilling and completion activity. Furthermore, because the production rate of natural gas and crude oil wells decline over time, production can only be maintained or increased by new drilling or other activity.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, cash paid for capital expenditures totaled $200.6 million, compared with $124.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $142.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Maintenance capital expenditures totaled $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with $15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2018, contributions to equity method investees totaled $4.9 million, compared with $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). The year-over-year increase in cash paid for capital expenditures primarily reflected the expansion of our existing gathering and processing complex in the DJ Basin with the addition of a new 60 MMcf/d cryogenic processing plant in addition to the development of our new associated natural gas gathering and processing system in the Permian Basin.\nMarcellus Shale. The Mountaineer Midstream system provides our midstream services for the Marcellus Shale reportable segment.\n___________\n \u2022 our operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy sector, without regard to financing or capital structure; \nThis MD&A comprises the following sections:\nVolume throughput declined during 2017 as a result of seven wells being commissioned behind the DFW gathering system in the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to the higher drilling and completion activities throughout 2016.\n* Not considered meaningful\n \u2022 the Williston Basin, which is served by Polar and Divide, Tioga Midstream and Bison Midstream; \n \u2022 In the fourth quarter of 2018, we impaired certain long-lived assets relating to the Tioga Midstream system in the Williston Basin (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). The impairment had no impact on segment adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2018. \n \u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources \nVolume throughput for the Ohio Gathering system decreased during 2017, compared to the prior period, primarily as a result of natural production declines and decreased drilling and completion activity. The decrease was partially offset by increased volumes associated with the installation of additional compression in the dry gas window beginning in March 2017.\nTotal costs and expenses increased $220.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior period, primarily reflected:\nTransaction costs. Financial and legal advisory costs associated with completed acquisitions and divestitures.\nIn addition, certain of our gathering systems are directly affected by crude oil supply and demand dynamics. Crude oil prices continued to increase during 2017 and 2018, with the average daily West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\") crude oil spot price increasing from an average $50.80 per barrel during 2017 to an average of $64.95 per barrel during 2018, representing a 28% increase. However, WTI closed at $45.91 per barrel on December 31, 2018 reflecting broader market concerns for global oil supply. In response to the general increase in crude oil prices, the number of active crude oil drilling rigs in the continental United States increased from 747 in December 2017 to 885 in December 2018, according to Baker Hughes. Over the next several years, we expect that crude oil prices will support continued drilling and increasing production in the Williston Basin, Permian Basin and DJ Basin.\nCash flows provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily reflected:\nWe rely primarily on internally generated cash flow as well as external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt, equity and preferred equity securities, to fund our capital expenditures. We believe that our Revolving Credit Facility, together with internally generated cash flow and financial support from our Sponsor and/or access to new debt or equity capital markets, will be adequate to finance our growth objectives for the foreseeable future without adversely impacting our liquidity or our ability to make quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders.\nDevelopments in any of these areas could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected or cause a significant reduction in the market price of our common units, preferred units and senior notes.\n \u2022 failure or delays by our customers in achieving expected production in their natural gas, crude oil and produced water projects; \nYear ended December 31, 2017. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $2.9 million during 2017, compared to the prior period, primarily reflecting:\n \u2022 In 2017, we updated the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation based on management's estimate of forecasted Business Adjusted EBITDA (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements) and capital expenditures for the 2016 Drop Down Assets. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower expected Business Adjusted EBITDA in 2018 and 2019 associated with the 2016 Drop Down Assets partially offset by lower estimated capital expenditures. The revision in estimated Business Adjusted EBITDA and estimated capital expenditures reflects a slower expected pace of drilling and completion activities from our customers, particularly in the Utica Shale in 2018 and 2019. As of December 31, 2017, we estimated the undiscounted future value of the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation to be approximately $454.4 million. As a result of revisions in these estimates, the estimated undiscounted future payment obligation decreased by $375.9 million relative to the estimate as of December 31, 2016. The revised estimates had a favorable impact on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 the availability, terms and cost of downstream transportation and processing services; \nYear ended December 31, 2018. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $10.3 million compared to the prior period primarily reflecting an increase in liquids volume throughput on our Polar and Divide system and $1.6 million in fees attributable to our Dakota Access Pipeline interconnect which was commissioned in the second quarter of 2017.\n \u2022 timely receipt of necessary government approvals and permits, our ability to control the costs of construction, including costs of materials, labor and rights-of-way and other factors that may impact our ability to complete projects within budget and on schedule; \n \u2022 In June 2016, an impairment loss was recognized by OCC. We recorded our 40% share of the impairment loss, or $37.8 million, in loss from equity method investees in the consolidated statements of operations. \n \u2022 $300.0 million paid for the repurchase of the outstanding 7.5% Senior Notes; \nEach of our reportable segments provides midstream services in a specific geographic area. Our reportable segments reflect the way in which we internally report the financial information used to make decisions and allocate resources in connection with our operations (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).\n \u2022 a $14.6 million increase for the Utica Shale segment due to the ongoing development of the Summit Utica system, including the commissioning of the TPL-7 connector project in late March 2017. \nTotal Revenues. Total revenues attributable to Corporate and Other was due to natural gas, NGL and crude oil marketing services activity (primarily natural gas sales) for the Piceance Basin, DJ Basin, Barnett Shale and Williston Basin segments.\nOur revenues are primarily attributable to the volumes that we gather, treat and/or process and the rates we charge for those services. A majority of our gathering and processing agreements are fee-based, which limits our direct exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. We also have percent-of-proceeds arrangements under which the gathering and processing revenues that we earn correlate directly with the fluctuating price of natural gas, condensate and NGLs.\nAdditional Information. For additional information, see the \"Results of Operations\" section herein and the notes to the consolidated financial statements. For information on pending accounting changes that are expected to materially impact our financial results reported in future periods, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.\nRecognition and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nIncome tax expense or benefit. Represents the expense or benefit associated with the Texas Margin Tax.\nOther items to note:\nDJ Basin. The Niobrara G&P system provides midstream services for the DJ Basin reportable segment. Volume throughput for our DJ Basin reportable segment follows.\nFor additional information on our long-term debt, see Notes 10 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n\nOur financial results are driven primarily by volume throughput and expense management. We generate the majority of our revenues from the gathering, treating and processing services that we provide to our customers. A majority of the volumes that we gather, treat and/or process have a fixed-fee rate structure which enhances the stability of our cash flows by providing a revenue stream that is not subject to direct commodity price risk. We also earn revenues from (i) the sale of physical natural gas and/or NGLs purchased under percentage-of-proceeds arrangements with certain of our customers on the Bison Midstream and Grand River systems, (ii) natural gas and crude oil marketing services in and around our gathering systems, (iii) the sale of natural gas we retain from certain DFW Midstream customers and (iv) the sale of condensate we retain from our gathering services at Grand River. These additional activities, including marketing transactions comprised of buy and sell arrangements, directly expose us to fluctuations in commodity prices and accounted for approximately 27% of total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2018. These additional activities, excluding marketing transactions comprised of buy and sell arrangements, accounted for approximately 11% of total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2018. We expect our natural gas and crude oil marketing services to increase in future periods.\nDepreciation and Amortization. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense during 2018 was primarily due to the impairment of certain intangible and long-lived assets on the Bison Midstream system in the Williston Basin segment recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense during 2017 was largely driven by an increase in assets placed into service in the Summit Utica system.\n\n(2) See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" herein and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital expenditures.\nAverage daily volume throughput during the year ended December 31, 2018 for the Permian Basin reportable segment totaled 1 MMcf/d.\nSegment Overview for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016", "item_7_tables": "Table 373: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>

and overall performance over the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. It discusses trends, significant transactions, and capital expenditure activities, emphasizing the stability and growth aspects of the business, especially through minimum volume commitments (MVCs), asset impairments, and capital expenditure funding. It also highlights shifts in operating costs and inflation, supply and demand dynamics for natural gas and crude oil, and the effect of changes in commodity prices on the company's operations.\n\nSignificant takeaways include:\n\n- An increase in gathering services and related fees due to volume growth and a favorable rate mix with certain customers.\n- Cash flows provided by operating activities, with variations year-on-year primarily because of changes in revenue and payments.\n- A change in deferred purchase price obligations (DPPOs) due to timing and discount rate fluctuations, offset by a slowing of drilling activities.\n- Impairments of certain assets in the Williston Basin and a strategic review leading to recoverability assessments.\n- A concentrated capital expenditure on growth areas, noting a plan to distribute most cash generated to unitholders.\n\nParticular attention is paid to the impact of the regulatory environment, competition, producers' drilling activities, upstream production, economic conditions, litigation, and the availability and cost of capital on the business. The report also references forward-looking statements and the inherent risks and uncertainties linked to these projections. \n\nA notable development was the revision of the expected undiscounted value of the DPPO as of December 31, 2017, and its impact on financial results. The discussion underscores the significance of natural gas, noting increases in Henry Hub spot prices from 2017 to 2018, and the corresponding response in drilling and production activities. The company relies on a combination of internal cash flow, external financing, and support from sponsors and Summit Investments to fund its capital requirements.\n\nThe report emphasizes that actual results may vary due to the multitude of risks and factors that can affect the company's operations and financial condition. It highlights the importance of managing costs, sourcing new supplies of production, and the flexibility to adapt to changes in the credit and/or equity capital markets. The document also includes cautionary language about the limitations of forward-looking statements and contingency plans made by management based on current expectations and information."}
