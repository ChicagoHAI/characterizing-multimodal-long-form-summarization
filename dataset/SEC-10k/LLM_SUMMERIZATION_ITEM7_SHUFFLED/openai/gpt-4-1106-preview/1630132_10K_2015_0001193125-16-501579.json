Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations for Bojangles', Inc. (\u201cBojangles'\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report. In this annual report, unless the context otherwise requires, references to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour\u201d mean the Company, together with its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis.\nOperating results for any one fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other fiscal year and our key performance indicators, as discussed below, may decrease for any future period. Unless otherwise stated, comparable restaurant sales and average unit volumes are presented on a system-wide basis, which means they include sales at both company-operated restaurants and franchised restaurants. Franchise sales represent sales at all franchised restaurants and are revenues to our franchisees. We do not record franchise sales as revenues; however, our franchise royalty revenues include royalties based on a percentage of franchise sales.\nOverview\nBojangles' is a highly differentiated and growing restaurant operator and franchisor dedicated to serving customers high-quality, craveable food made from our Southern recipes. We opened our first store in Charlotte, North Carolina in 1977 and, as of December 27, 2015, have expanded our system-wide restaurants to 662 across eleven states, the District of Columbia and Roatan Island, Honduras. Our system of restaurants, which includes both company-operated and franchised restaurants, generated approximately $1.2 billion of system-wide sales during fiscal year 2015. We offer fast-casual quality food and preparation combined with quick-service speed, convenience and value.\nKey Performance Indicators\nTo evaluate the performance of our business, we utilize a variety of financial and performance measures. These key measures include company restaurant revenues, franchise royalty and other franchise revenues, system-wide AUVs, comparable restaurant sales, restaurant openings and net income. In addition, we also evaluate Pro Forma Net Income and Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, and restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin which are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures.\nCompany Restaurant Revenues\nCompany restaurant revenues consist of sales of food and beverages in company-operated restaurants. Company restaurant revenues in a period are influenced by several factors, including the number of operating weeks in such period, the number of open restaurants and comparable restaurant sales growth.\nSeasonal factors cause our revenues to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our revenues per restaurant are typically lower in the first quarter. As a result, our quarterly and annual operating results and key performance indicators may fluctuate significantly.\nFranchise Royalty and Other Franchise Revenues\nFranchise royalty and other franchise revenues represents royalty income, and initial and renewal franchise fees. While we expect the majority of our total revenue growth will be driven by company-operated restaurants, our franchised restaurants and growth in franchise royalty and other franchise revenues remain an important part of our financial success.\nSystem-wide Average Unit Volumes\nWe measure system-wide AUVs on a fiscal year basis and on a trailing twelve month basis for each non-fiscal year-end period for system-wide restaurants. Annual AUVs are calculated using the following methodology: first, we determine the domestic free-standing restaurants with both a drive-thru and interior seating that have been open for a full 12 month period (excluding express units); and second, we calculate the revenues for these restaurants and divide by the number of restaurants in that base to arrive at our AUV calculation. This methodology is similar for each trailing twelve month period outside the fiscal year end.\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 27,\n2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 28,\n2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 29,\n2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollar amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Unit Volumes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total system-wide\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,839 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,774 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,728 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Comparable Restaurant Sales\nComparable restaurant sales reflects the change in year-over-year sales for the comparable restaurant base. A restaurant enters our comparable restaurant base the first full day of the month after being open for 15 months using a mid-month convention. While we do not record franchised sales as revenues, our royalty revenues are calculated based on a percentage of franchised restaurant sales.\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 27,\n2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 28,\n2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 29,\n2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Comparable Restaurant Sales:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Company-operated\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Franchised\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total system-wide\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Restaurant Openings\nThe number of restaurant openings reflects the number of restaurants opened during a particular reporting period. Before we open company-operated restaurants, we incur preopening expenses. System-wide, some of our restaurants open with an initial start-up period of higher than normal sales volume, which subsequently decreases to stabilized levels. Newly opened restaurants typically have lower annual sales volumes than our established company-operated restaurants. Newly opened company-operated restaurants typically experience normal inefficiencies such as higher food and supplies, labor and other direct operating costs and, as a result, restaurant contribution margins are typically lower during the start-up period of operations. In addition, newly opened restaurants typically have high occupancy costs compared to existing restaurants. When entering new markets, we may be exposed to longer start-up times and lower contribution margins than reflected in our average historical experience.\nThe following is the number of Bojangles' company-operated, franchised and system-wide restaurants at the beginning and end of fiscal 2013, 2014 and 2015:\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

a closure and an opening. During the fiscal years ended December 27, 2015, December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013, our franchisees closed 20, 4 and 5 restaurants, respectively, of which 7, 1 and 1, respectively, were relocations. During the fiscal years ended December 27, 2015, December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013, we closed 3, 3 and 2 Company-operated restaurants, respectively, of which 3, 2 and 2, respectively were relocations.\nNet Income, Pro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nWe consider net income to be a key performance indicator that shows the overall health of our entire business. We typically utilize net income in conjunction with the non-GAAP financial measures Pro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA when assessing the operational strength and the performance of our business.\nPro Forma Net Income represents company net income before items that we do not consider representative of our ongoing operating performance, as well as an estimate of recurring incremental legal, accounting, insurance and other operating and compliance costs we expect to incur as a public company for those periods where they had not yet been incurred, both as identified in the reconciliation table below. Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share represents company diluted net income per share before items that we do not consider representative of our ongoing operating performance, as well as an estimate of recurring incremental legal, accounting, insurance and other operating and compliance costs we expect to incur as a public company for those periods where they had not yet been incurred, both as identified in the reconciliation table below.\nEBITDA represents company net income before interest expense (net of interest income), provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents company net income before interest expense (net of interest income), provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, items that we do not consider representative of our ongoing operating performance and certain non-cash items, as identified in the reconciliation table below.\nPro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this Form 10-K are supplemental measures of our performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Pro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. In addition, in evaluating Pro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses or charges such as those added back to calculate Pro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Pro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nPro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are (i) they do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, (ii) they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs, (iii) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt, (iv) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Pro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements, (v) they do not adjust for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows, (vi) they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations, and (vii) other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from such non-GAAP financial measures. We further compensate for the limitations in our use of non-GAAP financial measures by presenting comparable GAAP measures more prominently.\nWe believe Pro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. These potential differences may be caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses) and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense). We also present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because (i) we believe these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry, (ii) we believe investors will find these measures useful in assessing our ability to service or incur indebtedness, and (iii) we use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA internally as benchmarks to evaluate our operating performance or compare our performance to that of our competitors.\nThe following tables set forth reconciliations of net income to Pro Forma Net Income and diluted net income

Margin\nRestaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Restaurant contribution is defined as company restaurant revenues less food and supplies costs, restaurant labor costs, and operating costs. We expect restaurant contribution to increase based on company-operated restaurants we open and our comparable restaurant sales growth. Restaurant contribution margin is defined as restaurant contribution as a percentage of company restaurant revenues. Fluctuations in restaurant contribution margin can be attributed to company comparable restaurant sales growth, sales volumes of newly opened company restaurants, and changes in company food and supplies costs, restaurant labor costs and operating costs.\nRestaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are supplemental measures of operating performance of our restaurants and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to those reported by other companies. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We believe that restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are important tools for investors as they are widely-used metrics within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant-level productivity, efficiency and performance. We use restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin as key metrics to evaluate profitability and performance of our restaurants across periods and to evaluate our restaurant financial performance compared to our competitors.\nThe following table reconciles our restaurant contribution to the line item on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income entitled \u201cCompany restaurant revenues,\u201d which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP measure on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollar amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>December 27,\n2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 28,\n2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 29,\n2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Company restaurant revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>462,138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>406,788 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>353,592 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Food and supplies costs(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(150,563 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(133,191 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(118,563 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restaurant labor costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(126,380 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(112,506 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(99,378 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100,916 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(88,476 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(75,160 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restaurant contribution(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84,279 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>72,615 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,491 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restaurant contribution margin(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>Fiscal 2014 includes a one-time reduction in food and supplies cost of approximately $1.5 million resulting from the termination of a vendor contract. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey Financial Definitions\nTotal Revenues\nOur revenues are derived from two primary sources: company restaurant revenues and franchise revenues. Franchise revenues are comprised of franchise royalty revenues and, to a lesser extent, other franchise revenues which include initial and renewal franchisee fees.\nFood and Supplies Costs\nFood and supplies costs include the direct costs associated with food, beverage and packaging of our menu items at company-operated restaurants. The components of food and supplies are variable in nature, change with sales volume, are affected by menu mix and are subject to fluctuations in commodity costs.\nRestaurant Labor Costs\nRestaurant labor costs, including preopening labor, consist of company-operated restaurant-level management and hourly labor costs, including salaries, wages, payroll taxes, workers' compensation expense, benefits and bonuses paid to our company-operated restaurant-level team members. Like other cost items, we expect restaurant labor costs at our company-operated restaurants to grow due to inflation and as our company restaurant revenues grows. Factors that influence labor costs include minimum wage and employer payroll tax legislation, health care costs and the performance of our restaurants. The PPACA has increased health care costs for our restaurants in fiscal 2015.\nOperating Costs\nRestaurant operating costs include all other company-operated restaurant-level operating expenses, such as repairs and maintenance, utilities, credit and debit card processing, occupancy expenses and other restaurant operating costs. In addition, our advertising costs are included in operating costs and are comprised of our company-operated restaurants' portion of spending on all advertising which includes, but is not limited to, television, radio, social media, billboards, point-of-sale materials, sponsorships, and creation of media, such as commercials and marketing campaigns.\nCompany Restaurant Depreciation and Amortization\nCompany restaurant depreciation and amortization primarily consists of the depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets at the restaurant level.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses include expenses associated with corporate and administrative functions that support our operations, including compensation and benefits, travel expense, stock-based compensation expense, legal and professional fees, training, and other corporate costs. We expect we will incur incremental increases in general and administrative expenses as a result of operating as a public company.\nOther Depreciation and Amortization\nOther depreciation and amortization primarily consists of the depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets not directly located at company-operated restaurants.\nImpairment\nLong-lived assets such as property, equipment and intangible assets are reviewed on a unit-by-unit basis for impairment. When circumstances indicate a carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable, an appropriate impairment is recorded.\nLoss (Gain) on Disposal of Property and Equipment\nLoss (gain) on disposal of property and equipment includes the net loss (gain) on disposal of assets related to retirements and replacements or write-off of leasehold improvements, equipment and other fixed assets. These losses (gains) are related to normal disposals in the ordinary course of business and gains from insurance proceeds, if any.\nAmortization of Deferred Debt Issuance Costs\nDeferred debt issuance costs are amortized over the term of the related debt on the effective interest method.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily consists of interest on our debt outstanding under our credit facility and capital lease obligations.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes represent federal, state, and local current and deferred income tax expense.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year 2015 Compared to

</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> n/m = not meaningful\nCompany Restaurant Revenues\nCompany restaurant revenues increased $55.4 million, or 13.6%, during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The growth in company restaurant revenues was primarily due to an increase in comparable company restaurant sales of $14.1 million, or 3.6%, composed of increases in price and mix at our comparable company restaurants, and an increase in the non-comparable restaurant base (net additions of 27 company-operated restaurants as of December 27, 2015 compared to December 28, 2014) accounting for $41.3 million.\nFranchise Royalty Revenues\nFranchise royalty revenues increased $2.4 million during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The increase was primarily due to an additional net 13 franchised restaurants at December 27, 2015 compared to December 28, 2014 and franchised comparable restaurant sales growth of 4.4%.\nFood and Supplies Costs\nFood and supplies costs increased $17.4 million during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in company restaurant revenues and a $1.5 million gain associated with the termination of a beverage vendor contract during fiscal 2014, which was recorded as a reduction to food and supplies costs. Excluding the impact of the $1.5 million gain associated with the termination of a beverage vendor contract, food and supplies costs as a percentage of company restaurant revenues during fiscal 2014 was 33.1% versus 32.6% during fiscal 2015. This percentage decrease was primarily due to our menu price increases, partially offset by commodity price increases.\nRestaurant Labor Costs\nCompany-operated restaurant labor increased $13.9 million during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to higher company restaurant revenues and increased health care costs. As a percentage of company restaurant revenues, restaurant labor costs decreased to 27.3% in fiscal 2015 from 27.7% in fiscal 2014. This decrease was primarily driven by an increase in comparable company restaurant sales which resulted in leveraging certain fixed labor expenses and a reduction in payroll taxes, partially offset by an increase in health care costs related to enrollment from the PPACA and higher medical claims.\nOperating Costs\nOperating costs increased $12.4 million during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to higher company restaurant revenues. As a percentage of company restaurant revenues, operating costs increased to 21.8% for fiscal 2015 from 21.7% in fiscal 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in local store marketing and occupancy costs, partially offset by leveraging comparable company restaurant sales growth.\nRestaurant Depreciation and Amortization\nRestaurant depreciation and amortization increased $1.7 million during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, due primarily to the increased number of company-operated restaurants and our new point-of-sale system. As a percentage of company restaurant revenues, depreciation and amortization was 2.5% and 2.4% during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $10.7 million during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The increase is due primarily to $4.6 million in legal, accounting and other expenses directly related to public offerings, $0.7 million of stock-based compensation expense as a result of the vesting of certain performance\nawards, $0.6 million of legal and other expenses incurred in connection with the transition to a new distributor, a $0.5 million accrual pursuant to an employment agreement, additional positions added to support an increased number of restaurants in our system, and additional costs as a result of operating as a public company. As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses were 8.8% and 7.5% during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively.\nWe expect our recurring general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we grow our business and incur additional expenses related to being a newer public company.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $0.8 million during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The decrease was due primarily to principal payments of $28.1 million on our long-term debt and a reduction in our applicable rate, partially offset by an increase in capital lease obligations during fiscal 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes increased $0.4 million during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. Our effective income tax rates were 37.7% and 37.4% during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively. The increase was primarily due to expenses incurred related to the IPO for which we will not receive a tax deduction, which was partially offset by the recognition of certain tax credits and a reduction in the North Carolina corporate income tax rate.\nFiscal Year 2014 Compared to Fiscal Year 2013\nOur operating results for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013 are

meaningful\nCompany Restaurant Revenues\nCompany restaurant revenues increased $53.2 million, or 15.0%, in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. The growth in company restaurant revenues was primarily due to an increase in comparable company restaurant sales of $13.5 million, or 4.0%, composed of increases in price, mix and transactions at our comparable company restaurants, and an increase in the non-comparable restaurant base (net additions of 29 company-operated restaurants as of December 28, 2014 compared to December 29, 2013) accounting for $39.7 million.\nFranchise Royalty Revenues\nFranchise royalty revenues increased $2.2 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. The increase was primarily due to an additional 16 franchised restaurants at December 28, 2014 compared to December 29, 2013 and franchised comparable restaurant sales growth of 5.0%.\nFood and Supplies Costs\nFood and supplies costs increased $14.6 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in company restaurant revenues. For fiscal 2014, food and supplies costs as a percentage of company restaurant revenues were 32.7% compared to 33.5% in fiscal 2013. This percentage decrease was primarily due to a $1.5 million gain associated with the termination of a beverage vendor contract which was recognized as an offset to food and supplies costs. Additionally, our menu price increase more than offset our commodity cost increases.\nRestaurant Labor Costs\nCompany-operated restaurant labor increased $13.1 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to higher company restaurant revenues. As a percentage of company restaurant revenues, restaurant labor costs decreased to 27.7% in fiscal 2014 from 28.1% in fiscal 2013. This decrease was primarily driven by an increase in comparable company restaurant sales which resulted in leveraging certain fixed labor expenses.\nOperating Costs\nOperating costs increased $13.3 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to higher company restaurant revenues. As a percentage of company restaurant revenues, operating costs increased to 21.7% for fiscal 2014 from 21.3% in fiscal 2013. This increase was primarily attributable to new company-operated restaurants having higher occupancy costs as a percentage of company restaurant revenues, partially offset by leveraging comparable company restaurant sales growth.\nRestaurant Depreciation and Amortization\nRestaurant depreciation and amortization increased $0.7 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, due primarily to the increased number of company-operated restaurants. As a percentage of company restaurant revenues, depreciation and amortization was 2.4% and 2.5% in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $4.6 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. The increase is due primarily to additional positions added to support an increased number of restaurants in our system, increased stock-based compensation expense of $0.6 million and employee relocation cost increase of $0.7 million. As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses were 7.5% and 7.3% in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $0.7 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. The increase was due primarily to an amendment to our credit facility in May 2013 borrowing an additional $50.0 million partially offset by a reduction in our interest rate, and another amendment in April 2014 borrowing an additional $50.0 million, partially offset by repayment of $21.4 million in fiscal 2014.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes increased $5.7 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. For fiscal 2014, our effective income tax rate was 37.4%, compared to an effective tax rate of 29.0% for fiscal 2013. The lower effective income tax rate in fiscal 2013 was primarily due to a state income tax rate reduction enacted by the State of North Carolina which resulted in a deferred income tax benefit.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary requirements for liquidity and capital are new company-operated restaurants, existing restaurant capital investments (remodels and maintenance), information technology investments, principal and interest payments on our term debt and capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations and working capital and general corporate needs. Our customers pay for their purchases in cash or by payment card (credit or debit) at the time of sale. Therefore, we are able to sell many of our inventory items before we have to pay our suppliers for such items. Our restaurants do not require significant inventories or receivables. We do have accounts receivable from our franchisees primarily related to royalty revenues, as well as from certain vendors.\nOur growth plan is dependent upon many factors, including economic conditions, real estate markets, restaurant locations and the nature of our lease agreements. Our capital expenditure outlays are also dependent on costs for maintenance in our existing restaurants as well as information technology and other general corporate expenditures. We primarily utilize build-to-suit developments and equipment financing leases for our new company-operated restaurants, requiring minimal upfront cash investment. While we currently utilize a build-to-suit development strategy, our new restaurant strategy may change over time.\nWe currently expect our cash capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 will range between $12.5 million and $13.5 million excluding approximately $1.7 million to $1.8 million of restaurant preopening expenses for restaurants that are not capitalized. These capital estimates are based on restaurant capital expenditures for the opening of 28 to 29 company-operated restaurants as well as investments to remodel and improve our existing restaurants, and for general corporate purposes.\nWe believe that cash and cash equivalents and expected cash flow from operations are adequate to fund debt service requirements, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations, capital expenditures and working capital needs for at least the next 12 months. However, our ability to continue to meet these requirements and obligations will depend on, among other things, our ability to achieve anticipated levels of revenues and cash flow from operations, our ability to manage costs and working capital successfully and the continued availability of build-to-suit and equipment financing leases for our new company-operated restaurants. We have used excess cash flows to make payments on our outstanding long-term debt in advance of the required due date, and we may continue to do so in future periods.\nThe following table presents summary cash flow information for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 27,\n2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 28,\n2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 29,\n2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,526 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,643 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,930 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,186 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,669 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,619 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(32,278 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26,229 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29,461 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,062 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,745 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(150 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from $41.6 million during the fiscal year ended December 28, 2014 to $45.5 million during the fiscal year ended December 27, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash generated from our operations due to the net increase in company-operated restaurants, franchise royalty revenues and an increase in comparable restaurant sales, partially offset by the costs associated with our IPO.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from $37.9 million during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2013 to $41.6 million during the fiscal year ended December 28, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash generated from our operations due to the net increase in company-operated restaurants, franchise royalty revenues and an increase in comparable restaurant sales.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased from $10.7 million during the fiscal year ended December 28, 2014 to $12.2 million during the fiscal year ended December 27, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in purchases of property and equipment of $4.6 million, partially offset by a $3.0 million decrease in the purchase of a franchisee's assets.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased from $8.6 million for fiscal 2013 to $10.7 million for fiscal 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the assets of eight Bojangles' restaurants from a franchisee in April 2014 for the purchase price of approximately $3.8 million of which approximately $0.6 million was deferred, a reduction in proceeds from disposition of property and equipment of approximately $0.8 million, offset by a decrease in purchases of property and equipment of approximately $1.9 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities increased from $26.2 million during the fiscal year ended December 28, 2014 to $32.3 million during the fiscal year ended December 27, 2015. This increase was primarily due to a $6.7 million increase in principal payments on long-term debt and a $0.7 million increase in principal payments on capital lease obligations, partially offset by a $0.6 million increase in excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation and $0.3 million of proceeds from stock option exercises.\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased from $29.5 million during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2013 to $26.2 million during the fiscal year ended December 28, 2014. This decrease was primarily due to a $4.0 million decrease in principal payments on long-term debt, partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in principal payments on capital lease obligations.\nDebt and Other Obligations\nCredit Agreement\nOn October 9, 2012, we entered into a credit agreement (\u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with several financial institutions. The Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets and originally provided for borrowings under a term loan of $175.0 million, and a revolving credit facility of $25.0 million, with a maturity date of October 9, 2017. In May 2013, we amended the Credit Agreement to provide for an additional $50.0 million term loan, the proceeds of which were used to fund a distribution to the holders of our Series A preferred stock. In April 2014, we further amended the Credit Agreement to provide for an additional $50.0 million term loan, the proceeds of which were also used to fund a distribution to the holders of our Series A preferred stock, and to extend the maturity date to October 9, 2018. On July 23, 2015, we amended the Credit Agreement in order to permit the merger of BHI Intermediate Holding Corp., our former wholly owned subsidiary into us. On September 25, 2015, we further amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, extend the maturity date on the Credit Agreement to October 9, 2020 and lower the applicable interest rate. We had $200.2 million of outstanding term loans and no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of December 27, 2015.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement are allowed under base rate and Eurodollar rate loans. Base rate loans bear interest at the higher of (1) the Bank of America prime rate, (2) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, or (3) the LIBOR rate for one-month loans plus 1.00% and an applicable rate. Eurodollar rate loans may be entered or converted into one-, two-, three-, or six-month periods and are charged interest at the LIBOR rate on the effective date for the period selected, plus an applicable rate. As of December 27, 2015, all of our outstanding term loan debt was in one-month Eurodollar loans with an interest rate of approximately 2.48%.\nDebt Covenants\nOur Credit Agreement contains various covenants that, among other things, do not allow us to exceed a maximum consolidated total lease adjusted leverage ratio, requires us to maintain a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, and place certain limitations on cash capital expenditures. We were in compliance with all of the covenants under our Credit Agreement as of December 27, 2015.\nHedging Arrangements\nIn connection with our Credit Agreement, we have three variable-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in the benchmark interest rate of LIBOR as of December 27, 2015. On May 17, 2013, we entered into an interest rate swap contract with a notional amount of $50.0 million, an effective date of November 30, 2015 and a termination date of September 29, 2017, under which we pay a fixed interest rate of 1.3325% and receive the one-month LIBOR rate. Also on May 17, 2013, we entered into a second interest rate swap contract with an effective date of May 31, 2013, a termination date of May 31, 2017 and a notional amount of $25.0 million, under which we pay interest fixed at 0.70125% and receive the one-month LIBOR rate. On October 26, 2015, we entered into a third interest rate swap contract with an effective date of October 30, 2015, a termination date of October 31, 2019 and a notional amount of $50.0 million, under which we pay interest fixed at 1.115% and receive the one-month LIBOR rate.\nContractual Obligations\nThe table below summarizes our contractual commitments to make future payments pursuant to our long-term debt and other obligations including operating lease obligations, capital lease obligations, marketing commitments and financing obligations under build-to-suit leases outstanding as of December 27, 2015, our most recent fiscal year-end for which a balance sheet is presented. The table does not include any new transactions after the fiscal year ended December 27, 2015 including, but not limited to, new operating and capital leases, new marketing commitments and new financing obligations under build-to-suit leases:\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>200,194 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,069 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>168,125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on long-term debt(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,893 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,304 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,929 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,660 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>352,382 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,895 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68,608 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>183,748 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,520 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,696 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marketing commitments(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,321 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,049 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,084 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing obligations under build-to-suit leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,594 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,594 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>620,321 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,362 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>128,993 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>248,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>188,444 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>Includes estimated interest payments calculated based on current interest rates as of December 27, 2015.

We may be required to perform this guarantee in the event of default or nonperformance of this franchisee. We have determined that default by the franchisee is unlikely due to timely and consistent payments, and have therefore not recorded a liability for the debt assumed by this franchisee on our consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value of debt covered by this additional guarantee by us was approximately $0.1 million and $0.2 million at December 27, 2015 and December 28, 2014, respectively.\nEmerging Growth Company\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and of stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe could remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until December 27, 2020 or until the earliest of (a) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (b) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (c) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities in the preceding three-year period.\nNew Accounting Standards\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This update was issued to replace the current revenue recognition guidance, creating a more comprehensive revenue model. This update was originally to be effective in fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early application was not permitted. In July 2015, the FASB affirmed its proposal to defer the effective date by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The FASB also affirmed its proposal to permit early adoption of the standard, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718). The new guidance provides new criteria for accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period. The amendments require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period is treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Topic 718 as it relates to awards with performance conditions and compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved. The standard will be effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect to early adopt this guidance and do not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest (\u201cASU 2015-03\u201d). The standard requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts or premiums. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. We adopted this guidance during our first fiscal quarter of 2016, and the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330) (\u201cASU 2015-11\u201d). The pronouncement was issued to simplify the measurement of inventory and changes the measurement from lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value. This pronouncement is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The adoption of ASU 2015-11 is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (\u201cASU 2015-17\u201d). ASU 2015-17 requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in ASU 2015-17. ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted and the standard may be applied either retrospectively or on a prospective basis to all deferred tax assets and liabilities. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (\u201cASU 2016-02\u201d). ASU 2016-02 is a comprehensive new leases standard that amends various aspects of existing guidance for leases and requires additional disclosures about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 will require companies to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. ASU 2016-02 retains a distinction between finance leases and operating leases. The classification criteria for distinguishing between finance leases and operating leases are substantially similar to the classification criteria for distinguishing between capital leases and operating leases in the previous leases guidance. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe FASB has recently issued or discussed a number of proposed standards on such topics as consolidation, financial statement presentation, financial instruments and hedging. Some of the proposed changes are significant and could have a material impact on our reporting. We have not yet fully evaluated the potential impact of all these proposals, but will make such an evaluation as the standards are finalized.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of operating results and financial condition are based upon our financial statements. The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis.\nAccounting policies are an integral part of our financial statements. A thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial position. Management believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve the most difficult management judgments due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions used. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more information about our significant accounting policies.\nFranchise Fee and Royalty Accounting\nWe grant franchises to individual restaurant operators in exchange for initial franchise license fees and continuing royalty payments. We account for initial franchisee fees in accordance with FASB ASC 952, Franchisors. Franchise license fees are deferred when received and recognized as revenues when substantial performance of all franchisor obligations have been achieved or the franchise development agreement is\nterminated. The commencement of operations by the franchisee indicates substantial performance has occurred. If substantial performance of our obligations has not been completed, revenues are not recognized and the amount received is deferred until all material services or conditions have been satisfied by us or the franchise development agreement is terminated. Continuing franchise royalty revenues are recognized on the accrual basis and are based on a percentage of monthly sales, generally ranging from 3% to 4% for franchisees operating within the United States of America, and 5% for franchisees with operations in other countries.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain allowances, which management believes are adequate to absorb estimated losses to be incurred in realizing the recorded amounts of its accounts receivable. These allowances are determined by management based primarily on an analysis of collectability of individual accounts and historical trends.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets Not Subject to Amortization\nThe excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles in a business combination is recorded as goodwill. In addition to goodwill, our indefinite-lived intangible asset consists of the Bojangles' brand. We do not amortize our goodwill and brand. We perform an impairment test for goodwill and our brand annually as of December 1 and when a triggering event occurs or change in circumstances indicates that impairment might exist. Such events or circumstances may be a significant change in business climate, economic and industry trends, legal factors, negative operating performance indicators, significant competition, changes in strategy or disposition.\nOur impairment review for goodwill consists of a qualitative assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, and if required, followed by a two-step process of determining the fair value and comparing it to the carrying value of the net assets. If the qualitative assessment demonstrates that it is more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value, it is not necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. We may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the two-step process in any period. We can resume the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. When performing the two-step process, if the fair value exceeds its carrying value, no further analysis or write-down of goodwill is required. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of its net assets, the estimated fair value is allocated to all its underlying assets and liabilities, including both recognized and unrecognized tangible and intangible assets, based on their fair value. If necessary, goodwill is then written down to its implied fair value. Our impairment review for our brand consists of a qualitative assessment similar to goodwill and, if necessary, a comparison of the fair value of our brand with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. If the fair value exceeds its carrying amount, our brand is not considered impaired.\nThe estimated fair value is the amount for which the business could be sold in market. We estimate the fair value using a combination of market earnings multiples and discounted cash flow methodologies. This requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth of our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment.\nWe determined the fair value of our goodwill and the fair value of our brand and both were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values when we performed our annual goodwill and brand impairment tests as of December 1, 2015. As such, we have determined that no impairment to our goodwill or our brand occurred during the fiscal years ended December 27, 2015, December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe state the value of our long-lived assets at cost, minus accumulated depreciation and amortization. We calculate depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. We amortize our leasehold improvements using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term (including reasonably assured renewal periods) or the estimated useful lives of the related assets. We expense repairs and maintenance as incurred, but capitalize major improvements and betterments.\nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment, and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment, we first compare undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.\nSome of the events or changes in circumstances that would trigger an impairment test include, but are not limited to:\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>bankruptcy proceedings or other significant financial distress; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>significant negative industry or economic trends; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>knowledge of transactions involving the sale of similar property at amounts below our carrying value; or </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>our expectation to dispose of long-lived assets before the end of their estimated useful lives, even though the assets do not meet the criteria to be classified as \u201cheld for sale.\u201d </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe recorded impairment charges of $1.2 million, $0.5 million and $0.7 million due to underperforming restaurants during the fiscal years ended December 27, 2015, December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013, respectively. The impaired assets had no value at December 27, 2015.\nLeases\nWe lease restaurant land and buildings, certain restaurant, office and point-of-sale equipment, office space and vehicles under operating and capital leases. Accounting for leased properties requires compliance with technical accounting rules and significant judgment by management. Application of these accounting rules and assumptions made by management will determine whether we are considered the owner for accounting purposes or whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or as a capital lease.\nThe lease term for all types of leases begins on the date we become legally obligated for the rent payments or we take possession of the building or land, whichever is earlier.\nAdditionally, we review leases for which we are involved in construction to determine whether build-to-suit and sale-leaseback criteria are met. For those leases that trigger specific build-to-suit accounting, we are considered the accounting owner of the construction project and in such cases, developer's construction costs are capitalized, including the value of costs incurred up to the date we execute our lease and costs incurred during the remainder of the construction period, as such costs are incurred. During the construction period an offsetting liability is recognized as a financing lease obligation for the construction costs incurred by the developer. The construction period begins when we execute our lease agreement with the property owner and continues until the space is substantially complete and ready for its intended use.\nOnce construction is complete, we are required to perform a sale-leaseback analysis to determine if we can remove the developer's assets and associated financing obligations from the balance sheet. If, in such cases, we maintain any form of \u201ccontinuing involvement\u201d in the property, it would preclude us from derecognizing the asset and associated financing obligations following the completion of construction. In those cases, we will continue to account for the asset as if we are the legal owner, and the financing obligation similar to other debt, until the lease expires or is modified to remove the continuing involvement that prohibits derecognition. If there is no \u201ccontinuing involvement\u201d and derecognition is permitted, we would be required to account for the lease as either operating or capital.\nRent expense for operating leases that contain scheduled rent increases is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the respective lease. Favorable lease assets and unfavorable lease liabilities were recorded in connection with the acquisition of the company by Advent and other stockholders in 2011. We amortize favorable and unfavorable leases on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the leases. Upon early termination of a lease, the write-off of the favorable or unfavorable lease carrying value associated with the lease is recognized as a loss or gain in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nCertain leases contain rent escalation clauses based on escalation terms. The excess of cumulative rent expense over cumulative rent payments made on leases with fixed escalation terms is recognized as deferred rents within other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets. Contingent rentals are generally based on sales levels in excess of stipulated amounts, and thus are not considered minimum lease payments at lease inception. We recognize contingent rent expense when it is deemed probable.\nIf the lease is classified as a capital lease, we record the present value of the minimum lease payments and a related capital lease obligation on our consolidated balance sheet. The asset is then amortized over the lesser of the economic life of the asset or the lease term. Rent payments for these properties are not recorded as rent expense, but rather are recognized as a reduction of the capital lease obligation and as interest expense.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe record the stock-based awards on the fair value of the shares at the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures, less the amount that the employee is required to pay. In order to calculate our stock options' fair values and the associated compensation costs for share-based awards, we utilize the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, and we have developed estimates of various inputs including expected term, expected volatility and risk-free interest rate. These assumptions generally require significant judgment. The forfeiture rate is based on historical rates and reduces the compensation expense recognized. The expected term for options granted is derived using the \u201csimplified\u201d method, in accordance with SEC guidance. Expected volatility is estimated using publicly-traded peer companies in our market category. Volatility is calculated with reference to the historical daily closing equity prices of our peer companies, prior to the grant date, over a period equal to the expected term. We calculate the risk-free interest rate using the implied yield for a U.S. Treasury security with constant maturity and a remaining term equal to the expected term of our employee stock options. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero for option valuation purposes.\nThere were no stock options granted during the fiscal year ended December 27, 2015. The assumptions used for grants made during the fiscal years ended December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013 are provided in the following table:\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 28,\n2014 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 29,\n2013 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Valuation assumptions:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td> </td> <td>0% </td> <td> </td> <td>0% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td> </td> <td>32.00% to 34.90% </td> <td> </td> <td>34.70% to 36.09% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term\n</td> <td> </td> <td>5.75 to 6.49 years </td> <td> </td> <td>6.11 years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1.72% to 1.98% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.05% to 1.12% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf in the future we determine that another method is more reasonable, or if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance, and, therefore, should be used to estimate volatility or expected life, the fair value calculated for our stock options could change significantly. Higher volatility and longer expected lives result in an increase in stock-based compensation expense determined at the date of grant. Stock-based compensation expense affects our general and administrative expenses.\nPrior to our IPO, it was necessary to estimate the fair value of the common stock underlying our equity awards when computing fair value calculations under the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The fair value of our common stock was assessed on each grant date by our board of directors. Given the absence of an active market for our common stock, our board of directors estimated our common stock's fair value based on an analysis of a number of objective and subjective factors that they believed that market participants would consider in valuing it, including the following:\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>financial metrics, including, but not limited to, our results of operations; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the valuation of our common stock by an unrelated third-party valuation firm for all stock options awarded in fiscal 2014; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the hiring of key personnel; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the fact that the option grants involved illiquid securities in a private company; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the risks inherent in the development and expansion of our food and services; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or sale of our company, given prevailing market conditions. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBefore our IPO, we historically granted stock options with exercise prices not less than the fair value of our common stock underlying such stock options, as determined on the date of grant by our board of directors, with input from our management and from an independent third-party valuation expert for stock options awarded in fiscal 2014 only.\nWe did not grant any stock options to employees, officers or board members during the fiscal year ended December 27, 2015. We granted 1,155,022 and 143,613 stock options to employees, officers and board members during the fiscal years ended December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013, respectively. Stock option holders forfeited 6,732, 408,047 and 26,927 stock options during the fiscal years ended December 27, 2015, December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense of approximately $2.0 million, $1.4 million and $0.8 million for the fiscal years ended December 27, 2015, December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013, respectively, is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is the price the company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants. For those assets and liabilities recorded or disclosed at fair value, we determine fair value based upon the quoted market price, if available. If a quoted market price is not available for identical assets or liabilities, we determine fair value based upon the quoted market price of similar assets or liabilities or the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved, including counterparty performance risk, if appropriate, and using discount rates appropriate for the duration. The fair values are assigned a level within the fair value hierarchy depending on the source of the inputs into the calculation.\nLevel 1 - Inputs based upon quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3 - Inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nWe use interest-rate-related derivative instruments to manage our exposure related to changes in interest rates on our variable-rate debt instruments. We do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging. For all hedging relationships, we formally document the hedging relationship and risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the hedging instrument, the hedged transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, how the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively, and a description of the method used to measure ineffectiveness. We also formally assess, both at the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging relationships are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged transactions.\nWe recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at their fair values. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined using an income approach using the following significant inputs: the term of the swaps, the notional amount of the swaps, and the rate on the fixed leg of the swaps.\nFor derivative instruments designated in a cash flow hedging relationship, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.\nWe discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when we determine that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, the cash flow hedge is de-designated because a forecasted transaction is not probable of occurring, or management determines to remove the designation of the cash flow hedge.\nIn all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, we continue to carry the derivative at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and recognize any subsequent changes in its fair value in earnings.", "item_7_truncated": "Company Restaurant Revenues\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

The commencement of operations by the franchisee indicates substantial performance has occurred. If substantial performance of our obligations has not been completed, revenues are not recognized and the amount received is deferred until all material services or conditions have been satisfied by us or the franchise development agreement is terminated. Continuing franchise royalty revenues are recognized on the accrual basis and are based on a percentage of monthly sales, generally ranging from 3% to 4% for franchisees operating within the United States of America, and 5% for franchisees with operations in other countries.\nRestaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are supplemental measures of operating performance of our restaurants and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to those reported by other companies. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We believe that restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are important tools for investors as they are widely-used metrics within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant-level productivity, efficiency and performance. We use restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin as key metrics to evaluate profitability and performance of our restaurants across periods and to evaluate our restaurant financial performance compared to our competitors.\nTo evaluate the performance of our business, we utilize a variety of financial and performance measures. These key measures include company restaurant revenues, franchise royalty and other franchise revenues, system-wide AUVs, comparable restaurant sales, restaurant openings and net income. In addition, we also evaluate Pro Forma Net Income and Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, and restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin which are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe Pro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. These potential differences may be caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses) and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense). We also present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because (i) we believe these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry, (ii) we believe investors will find these measures useful in assessing our ability to service or incur indebtedness, and (iii) we use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA internally as benchmarks to evaluate our operating performance or compare our performance to that of our competitors.\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 27,\n2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 28,\n2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 29,\n2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Comparable Restaurant Sales:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Company-operated\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Franchised\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total system-wide\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRestaurant Labor Costs\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 28,\n2014 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 29,\n2013 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Valuation assumptions:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td> </td> <td>0% </td> <td> </td> <td>0% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td> </td> <td>32.00% to 34.90% </td> <td> </td> <td>34.70% to 36.09% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term\n</td> <td> </td> <td>5.75 to 6.49 years </td> <td> </td> <td>6.11 years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1.72% to 1.98% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.05% to 1.12% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718). The new guidance provides new criteria for accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period. The amendments require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period is treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Topic 718 as it relates to awards with performance conditions and compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved. The standard will be effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect to early adopt this guidance and do not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOther depreciation and amortization primarily consists of the depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets not directly located at company-operated restaurants.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (\u201cASU 2016-02\u201d). ASU 2016-02 is a comprehensive new leases standard that amends various aspects of existing guidance for leases and requires additional disclosures about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 will require companies to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. ASU 2016-02 retains a distinction between finance leases and operating leases. The classification criteria for distinguishing between finance leases and operating leases are substantially similar to the classification criteria for distinguishing between capital leases and operating leases in the previous leases guidance. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.\n (h) Includes legal and other expenses incurred in connection with the transition to our new distributor. \n (i) Includes loss on disposal of property and equipment, impairment and cash proceeds on disposals from disposition of property and equipment. \nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollar amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>December 27,\n2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 28,\n2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 29,\n2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,526 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,327 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,034 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,915 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,121 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,398 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization(a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,086 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,818 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,869 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBITDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65,953 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,648 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,509 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash rent(b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,642 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,513 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,336 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation(c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,420 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>838 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Preopening expenses(d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,540 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,358 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,112 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sponsor and board member fees and expenses(e)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,059 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,071 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Certain professional, transaction and other costs(f)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,254 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>805 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>159 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Employee contract expense(g)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Distributor transition costs(h)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>594 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment and dispositions(i)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,592 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>557 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>886 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain from termination of a vendor contract(j)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,475 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> One-time franchise equipment expenses(k)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>547 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>79,265 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>68,885 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,458 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLevel 2 -

Restaurant contribution is defined as company restaurant revenues less food and supplies costs, restaurant labor costs, and operating costs. We expect restaurant contribution to increase based on company-operated restaurants we open and our comparable restaurant sales growth. Restaurant contribution margin is defined as restaurant contribution as a percentage of company restaurant revenues. Fluctuations in restaurant contribution margin can be attributed to company comparable restaurant sales growth, sales volumes of newly opened company restaurants, and changes in company food and supplies costs, restaurant labor costs and operating costs.\nOperating costs increased $12.4 million during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to higher company restaurant revenues. As a percentage of company restaurant revenues, operating costs increased to 21.8% for fiscal 2015 from 21.7% in fiscal 2014.

In other words, an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\n (g) As a result of enacted reductions to the North Carolina corporate income tax rate, we adjusted our deferred income taxes during the fiscal years ended December 27, 2015 and December 29, 2013 by applying the lower rate, which resulted in a corresponding decrease to income tax expense. \nFair value is the price the company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants. For those assets and liabilities recorded or disclosed at fair value, we determine fair value based upon the quoted market price, if available. If a quoted market price is not available for identical assets or liabilities, we determine fair value based upon the quoted market price of similar assets or liabilities or the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved, including counterparty performance risk, if appropriate, and using discount rates appropriate for the duration. The fair values are assigned a level within the fair value hierarchy depending on the source of the inputs into the calculation.\n \u2022 our expectation to dispose of long-lived assets before the end of their estimated useful lives, even though the assets do not meet the criteria to be classified as \u201cheld for sale.\u201d \n \u2022 the fact that the option grants involved illiquid securities in a private company; \nIf in the future we determine that another method is more reasonable, or if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance, and, therefore, should be used to estimate volatility or expected life, the fair value calculated for our stock options could change significantly. Higher volatility and longer expected lives result in an increase in stock-based compensation expense determined at the date of grant. Stock-based compensation expense affects our general and administrative expenses.\n (a) Includes amortization of deferred debt issuance costs. \n (j) Represents the elimination of a gain from the termination of a contract with a beverage vendor. \nOur discussion and analysis of operating results and financial condition are based upon our financial statements. The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis.\nDebt Covenants\nThe following is the number of Bojangles' company-operated, franchised and system-wide restaurants at the beginning and end of fiscal 2013, 2014 and 2015:\nWe recorded impairment charges of $1.2 million, $0.5 million and $0.7 million due to underperforming restaurants during the fiscal years ended December 27, 2015, December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013, respectively. The impaired assets had no value at December 27, 2015.\n\nPrior to our IPO, it was necessary to estimate the fair value of the common stock underlying our equity awards when computing fair value calculations under the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The fair value of our common stock was assessed on each grant date by our board of directors. Given the absence of an active market for our common stock, our board of directors estimated our common stock's fair value based on an analysis of a number of objective and subjective factors that they believed that market participants would consider in valuing it, including the following:\nTotal Revenues\nFiscal Year 2015 Compared to Fiscal Year 2014\nOperating results for any one fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other fiscal year and our key performance indicators, as discussed below, may decrease for any future period. Unless otherwise stated, comparable restaurant sales and average unit volumes are presented on a system-wide basis, which means they include sales at both company-operated restaurants and franchised restaurants. Franchise sales represent sales at all franchised restaurants and are revenues to our franchisees. We do not record franchise sales as revenues; however, our franchise royalty revenues include royalties based on a percentage of franchise sales.\nOur operating results for the fiscal years ended December 27, 2015 and December 28, 2014 are compared below:\nOur impairment review for goodwill consists of a qualitative assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, and if required, followed by a two-step process of determining the fair value and comparing it to the carrying value of the net assets. If the qualitative assessment demonstrates that it is more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value, it is not necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. We may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the two-step process in any period. We can resume the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. When performing the two-step process, if the fair value exceeds its carrying value, no further analysis or write-down of goodwill is required. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of its net assets, the estimated fair value is allocated to all its underlying assets and liabilities, including both recognized and unrecognized tangible and intangible assets, based on their fair value. If necessary, goodwill is then written down to its implied fair value. Our impairment review for our brand consists of a qualitative assessment similar to goodwill and, if necessary, a comparison of the fair value of our brand with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. If the fair value exceeds its carrying amount, our brand is not considered impaired.\n \u2022 the hiring of key personnel; \nCompany Restaurant Revenues\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $4.6 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. The increase is due primarily to additional positions added to support an increased number of restaurants in our system, increased stock-based compensation expense of $0.6 million and employee relocation cost increase of $0.7 million. As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses were 7.5% and 7.3% in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively.\n (i) Represents a net gain from insurance proceeds associated with a fire at a company-operated restaurant. \n Operating Activities\nLong-Lived Assets\nFranchise Royalty and Other Franchise Revenues\nFranchise royalty revenues increased $2.2 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. The increase was primarily due to an additional 16 franchised restaurants at December 28, 2014 compared to December 29, 2013 and franchised comparable restaurant sales growth of 5.0%.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur growth plan is dependent upon many factors, including economic conditions, real estate markets, restaurant locations and the nature of our lease agreements. Our capital expenditure outlays are also dependent on costs for maintenance in our existing restaurants as well as information technology and other general corporate expenditures. We primarily utilize build-to-suit developments and equipment financing leases for our new company-operated restaurants, requiring minimal upfront cash investment. While we currently utilize a build-to-suit development strategy, our new restaurant strategy may change over time.\nWe measure system-wide AUVs on a fiscal year basis and on a trailing twelve month basis for each non-fiscal year-end period for system-wide restaurants. Annual AUVs are calculated using the following methodology: first, we determine the domestic free-standing restaurants with both a drive-thru and interior seating that have been open for a full 12 month period (excluding express units); and second, we calculate the revenues for these restaurants and divide by the number of restaurants in that base to arrive at our AUV calculation. This methodology is similar for each trailing twelve month period outside the fiscal year end.\n (h) Includes the cost of the purchase of equipment for franchisees in connection with a one-time initiative which was completed in fiscal 2013. \nFood and Supplies Costs\nInterest expense increased $0.7 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. The increase was due primarily to an amendment to our credit facility in May 2013 borrowing an additional $50.0 million partially offset by a reduction in our interest rate, and another amendment in April 2014 borrowing an additional $50.0 million, partially offset by repayment of $21.4 million in fiscal 2014.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased from $10.7 million during the fiscal year ended December 28, 2014 to $12.2 million during the fiscal year ended December 27, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in purchases of property and equipment of $4.6 million, partially offset by a $3.0 million decrease in the purchase of a franchisee's assets.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nEBITDA represents company net income before interest expense (net of interest income), provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents company net income before interest expense (net of interest income), provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, items that we do not consider representative of our ongoing operating performance and certain non-cash items, as identified in the reconciliation table below.\nOperating Costs\nWe discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when we determine that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, the cash flow hedge is de-designated because a forecasted transaction is not probable of occurring, or management determines to remove the designation of the cash flow hedge.\nAccounting policies are an integral part of our financial statements. A thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial position. Management believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve the most difficult management judgments due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions used. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more information about our significant accounting policies.\nOperating Costs\nBefore our IPO, we historically granted stock options with exercise prices not less than the fair value of our common stock underlying such stock options, as determined on the date of grant by our board of directors, with input from our management and from an independent third-party valuation expert for stock options awarded in fiscal 2014 only.\nIncome Taxes\n (c) Includes non-cash, stock-based compensation, as well as employer payroll taxes associated with stock option exercises related to stock options that were outstanding prior to our IPO. \nIncome Taxes\nLeases\n (j) Represents the income tax (expense) benefit associated with the adjustments in (a) through (i) that are deductible for income tax purposes. \nIn April 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest (\u201cASU 2015-03\u201d). The standard requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts or premiums. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. We adopted this guidance during our first fiscal quarter of 2016, and the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330) (\u201cASU 2015-11\u201d). The pronouncement was issued to simplify the measurement of inventory and changes the measurement from lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value. This pronouncement is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The adoption of ASU 2015-11 is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\n\n n/m = not meaningful\n Comparable Restaurant Sales\nawards, $0.6 million of legal and other expenses incurred in connection with the transition to a new distributor, a $0.5 million accrual pursuant to an employment agreement, additional positions added to support an increased number of restaurants in our system, and additional costs as a result of operating as a public company. As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses were 8.8% and 7.5% during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively.\n \u2022 financial metrics, including, but not limited to, our results of operations; \n A relocation results in a closure and an opening. During the fiscal years ended December 27, 2015, December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013, our franchisees closed 20, 4 and 5 restaurants, respectively, of which 7, 1 and 1, respectively, were relocations. During the fiscal years ended December 27, 2015, December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013, we closed 3, 3 and 2 Company-operated restaurants, respectively, of which 3, 2 and 2, respectively were relocations.\nWe maintain allowances, which management believes are adequate to absorb estimated losses to be incurred in realizing the recorded amounts of its accounts receivable. These allowances are determined by management based primarily on an analysis of collectability of individual accounts and historical trends.\nCompany restaurant revenues increased $55.4 million, or 13.6%, during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The growth in company restaurant revenues was primarily due to an increase in comparable company restaurant sales of $14.1 million, or 3.6%, composed of increases in price and mix at our comparable company restaurants, and an increase in the non-comparable restaurant base (net additions of 27 company-operated restaurants as of December 27, 2015 compared to December 28, 2014) accounting for $41.3 million.\nThe following table reconciles our restaurant contribution to the line item on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income entitled \u201cCompany restaurant revenues,\u201d which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP measure on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nPro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are (i) they do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, (ii) they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs, (iii) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt, (iv) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Pro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements, (v) they do not adjust for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows, (vi) they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations, and (vii) other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nNet Income, Pro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nInterest expense primarily consists of interest on our debt outstanding under our credit facility and capital lease obligations.\nOur operating results for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013 are compared below:\nHedging Arrangements\nThe following table presents summary cash flow information for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nThere were no stock options granted during the fiscal year ended December 27, 2015. The assumptions used for grants made during the fiscal years ended December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013 are provided in the following table:\nThe estimated fair value is the amount for which the business could be sold in market. We estimate the fair value using a combination of market earnings multiples and discounted cash flow methodologies. This requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth of our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment.\nOur Credit Agreement contains various covenants that, among other things, do not allow us to exceed a maximum consolidated total lease adjusted leverage ratio, requires us to maintain a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, and place certain limitations on cash capital expenditures. We were in compliance with all of the covenants under our Credit Agreement as of December 27, 2015.\nInterest Expense\nWe grant franchises to individual restaurant operators in exchange for initial franchise license fees and continuing royalty payments. We account for initial franchisee fees in accordance with FASB ASC 952, Franchisors. Franchise license fees are deferred when received and recognized as revenues when substantial performance of all franchisor obligations have been achieved or the franchise development agreement is\nKey Performance Indicators\nCompany-operated restaurant labor increased $13.9 million during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to higher company restaurant revenues and increased health care costs. As a percentage of company restaurant revenues, restaurant labor costs decreased to 27.3% in fiscal 2015 from 27.7% in fiscal 2014. This decrease was primarily driven by an increase in comparable company restaurant sales which resulted in leveraging certain fixed labor expenses and a reduction in payroll taxes, partially offset by an increase in health care costs related to enrollment from the PPACA and higher medical claims.\n (b) Includes deferred rent, which represents the extent to which our rent expense has been above or below our cash rent payments, amortization of favorable (unfavorable) leases and closed store reserves for rent net of cash payments. \nFranchise Royalty Revenues\nCompany restaurant depreciation and amortization primarily consists of the depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets at the restaurant level.\nWe did not grant any stock options to employees, officers or board members during the fiscal year ended December 27, 2015. We granted 1,155,022 and 143,613 stock options to employees, officers and board members during the fiscal years ended December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013, respectively. Stock option holders forfeited 6,732, 408,047 and 26,927 stock options during the fiscal years ended December 27, 2015, December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense of approximately $2.0 million, $1.4 million and $0.8 million for the fiscal years ended December 27, 2015, December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013, respectively, is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\n (1) Fiscal 2014 includes a one-time reduction in food and supplies cost of approximately $1.5 million resulting from the termination of a vendor contract. \nDebt and Other Obligations\nCompany-operated restaurant labor increased $13.1 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to higher company restaurant revenues. As a percentage of company restaurant revenues, restaurant labor costs decreased to 27.7% in fiscal 2014 from 28.1% in fiscal 2013. This decrease was primarily driven by an increase in comparable company restaurant sales which resulted in leveraging certain fixed labor expenses.\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from such non-GAAP financial measures. We further compensate for the limitations in our use of non-GAAP financial measures by presenting comparable GAAP measures more prominently.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from $41.6 million during the fiscal year ended December 28, 2014 to $45.5 million during the fiscal year ended December 27, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash generated from our operations due to the net increase in company-operated restaurants, franchise royalty revenues and an increase in comparable restaurant sales, partially offset by the costs associated with our IPO.\nCredit Agreement\nFood and Supplies Costs\nFranchise royalty revenues increased $2.4 million during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The increase was primarily due to an additional net 13 franchised restaurants at December 27, 2015 compared to December 28, 2014 and franchised comparable restaurant sales growth of 4.4%.\nLoss (Gain) on Disposal of Property and Equipment\nOur primary requirements for liquidity and capital are new company-operated restaurants, existing restaurant capital investments (remodels and maintenance), information technology investments, principal and interest payments on our term debt and capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations and working capital and general corporate needs. Our customers pay for their purchases in cash or by payment card (credit or debit) at the time of sale. Therefore, we are able to sell many of our inventory items before we have to pay our suppliers for such items. Our restaurants do not require significant inventories or receivables. We do have accounts receivable from our franchisees primarily related to royalty revenues, as well as from certain vendors.\nInterest Expense\nSeasonal factors cause our revenues to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our revenues per restaurant are typically lower in the first quarter. As a result, our quarterly and annual operating results and key performance indicators may fluctuate significantly.\nThe FASB has recently issued or discussed a number of proposed standards on such topics as consolidation, financial statement presentation, financial instruments and hedging. Some of the proposed changes are significant and could have a material impact on our reporting. We have not yet fully evaluated the potential impact of all these proposals, but will make such an evaluation as the standards are finalized.\n (2) Includes commitments for various marketing sponsorships and expenses.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n \u2022 significant negative industry or economic trends; \nSome of the events or changes in circumstances that would trigger an impairment test include, but are not limited to:\nRent expense for operating leases that contain scheduled rent increases is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the respective lease. Favorable lease assets and unfavorable lease liabilities were recorded in connection with the acquisition of the company by Advent and other stockholders in 2011. We amortize favorable and unfavorable leases on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the leases. Upon early termination of a lease, the write-off of the favorable or unfavorable lease carrying value associated with the lease is recognized as a loss or gain in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This update was issued to replace the current revenue recognition guidance, creating a more comprehensive revenue model. This update was originally to be effective in fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early application was not permitted. In July 2015, the FASB affirmed its proposal to defer the effective date by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The FASB also affirmed its proposal to permit early adoption of the standard, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements.\nLoss (gain) on disposal of property and equipment includes the net loss (gain) on disposal of assets related to retirements and replacements or write-off of leasehold improvements, equipment and other fixed assets. These losses (gains) are related to normal disposals in the ordinary course of business and gains from insurance proceeds, if any.\nIn all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, we continue to carry the derivative at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and recognize any subsequent changes in its fair value in earnings.\n \u2022 the risks inherent in the development and expansion of our food and services; and \nWe determined the fair value of our goodwill and the fair value of our brand and both were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values when we performed our annual goodwill and brand impairment tests as of December 1, 2015. As such, we have determined that no impairment to our goodwill or our brand occurred during the fiscal years ended December 27, 2015, December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013.\nIncome taxes increased $0.4 million during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. Our effective income tax rates were 37.7% and 37.4% during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively. The increase was primarily due to expenses incurred related to the IPO for which we will not receive a tax deduction, which was partially offset by the recognition of certain tax credits and a reduction in the North Carolina corporate income tax rate.\nThe number of restaurant openings reflects the number of restaurants opened during a particular reporting period. Before we open company-operated restaurants, we incur preopening expenses. System-wide, some of our restaurants open with an initial start-up period of higher than normal sales volume, which subsequently decreases to stabilized levels. Newly opened restaurants typically have lower annual sales volumes than our established company-operated restaurants. Newly opened company-operated restaurants typically experience normal inefficiencies such as higher food and supplies, labor and other direct operating costs and, as a result, restaurant contribution margins are typically lower during the start-up period of operations. In addition, newly opened restaurants typically have high occupancy costs compared to existing restaurants. When entering new markets, we may be exposed to longer start-up times and lower contribution margins than reflected in our average historical experience.\nThe following table sets forth reconciliations of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\n\nRestaurant operating costs include all other company-operated restaurant-level operating expenses, such as repairs and maintenance, utilities, credit and debit card processing, occupancy expenses and other restaurant operating costs. In addition, our advertising costs are included in operating costs and are comprised of our company-operated restaurants' portion of spending on all advertising which includes, but is not limited to, television, radio, social media, billboards, point-of-sale materials, sponsorships, and creation of media, such as commercials and marketing campaigns.\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased from $29.5 million during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2013 to $26.2 million during the fiscal year ended December 28, 2014. This decrease was primarily due to a $4.0 million decrease in principal payments on long-term debt, partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in principal payments on capital lease obligations.\nIncome taxes increased $5.7 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. For fiscal 2014, our effective income tax rate was 37.4%, compared to an effective tax rate of 29.0% for fiscal 2013. The lower effective income tax rate in fiscal 2013 was primarily due to a state income tax rate reduction enacted by the State of North Carolina which resulted in a deferred income tax benefit.\nRestaurant Labor Costs\nOnce construction is complete, we are required to perform a sale-leaseback analysis to determine if we can remove the developer's assets and associated financing obligations from the balance sheet. If, in such cases, we maintain any form of \u201ccontinuing involvement\u201d in the property, it would preclude us from derecognizing the asset and associated financing obligations following the completion of construction. In those cases, we will continue to account for the asset as if we are the legal owner, and the financing obligation similar to other debt, until the lease expires or is modified to remove the continuing involvement that prohibits derecognition. If there is no \u201ccontinuing involvement\u201d and derecognition is permitted, we would be required to account for the lease as either operating or capital.\nRestaurant Contribution and Restaurant Contribution Margin\nLevel 1 - Inputs based upon quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nIn connection with our Credit Agreement, we have three variable-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in the benchmark interest rate of LIBOR as of December 27, 2015. On May 17, 2013, we entered into an interest rate swap contract with a notional amount of $50.0 million, an effective date of November 30, 2015 and a termination date of September 29, 2017, under which we pay a fixed interest rate of 1.3325% and receive the one-month LIBOR rate. Also on May 17, 2013, we entered into a second interest rate swap contract with an effective date of May 31, 2013, a termination date of May 31, 2017 and a notional amount of $25.0 million, under which we pay interest fixed at 0.70125% and receive the one-month LIBOR rate. On October 26, 2015, we entered into a third interest rate swap contract with an effective date of October 30, 2015, a termination date of October 31, 2019 and a notional amount of $50.0 million, under which we pay interest fixed at 1.115% and receive the one-month LIBOR rate.\nOverview\nFood and supplies costs increased $14.6 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in company restaurant revenues. For fiscal 2014, food and supplies costs as a percentage of company restaurant revenues were 32.7% compared to 33.5% in fiscal 2013. This percentage decrease was primarily due to a $1.5 million gain associated with the termination of a beverage vendor contract which was recognized as an offset to food and supplies costs. Additionally, our menu price increase more than offset our commodity cost increases.\nOur revenues are derived from two primary sources: company restaurant revenues and franchise revenues. Franchise revenues are comprised of franchise royalty revenues and, to a lesser extent, other franchise revenues which include initial and renewal franchisee fees.\nWe believe that cash and cash equivalents and expected cash flow from operations are adequate to fund debt service requirements, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations, capital expenditures and working capital needs for at least the next 12 months. However, our ability to continue to meet these requirements and obligations will depend on, among other things, our ability to achieve anticipated levels of revenues and cash flow from operations, our ability to manage costs and working capital successfully and the continued availability of build-to-suit and equipment financing leases for our new company-operated restaurants. We have used excess cash flows to make payments on our outstanding long-term debt in advance of the required due date, and we may continue to do so in future periods.\nLevel 3 - Inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability.\n \u2022 knowledge of transactions involving the sale of similar property at amounts below our carrying value; or \n n/m = not meaningful\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets Not Subject to Amortization\nFiscal Year 2014 Compared to Fiscal Year 2013\nThe lease term for all types of leases begins on the date we become legally obligated for the rent payments or we take possession of the building or land, whichever is earlier.\nThe excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles in a business combination is recorded as goodwill. In addition to goodwill, our indefinite-lived intangible asset consists of the Bojangles' brand. We do not amortize our goodwill and brand. We perform an impairment test for goodwill and our brand annually as of December 1 and when a triggering event occurs or change in circumstances indicates that impairment might exist. Such events or circumstances may be a significant change in business climate, economic and industry trends, legal factors, negative operating performance indicators, significant competition, changes in strategy or disposition.\nWe have guaranteed through 2018 debt from a previous credit facility which was assumed by a franchisee. We may be required to perform this guarantee in the event of default or nonperformance of this franchisee. We have determined that default by the franchisee is unlikely due to timely and consistent payments, and have therefore not recorded a liability for the debt assumed by this franchisee on our consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value of debt covered by this additional guarantee by us was approximately $0.1 million and $0.2 million at December 27, 2015 and December 28, 2014, respectively.\nOn October 9, 2012, we entered into a credit agreement (\u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with several financial institutions. The Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets and originally provided for borrowings under a term loan of $175.0 million, and a revolving credit facility of $25.0 million, with a maturity date of October 9, 2017. In May 2013, we amended the Credit Agreement to provide for an additional $50.0 million term loan, the proceeds of which were used to fund a distribution to the holders of our Series A preferred stock. In April 2014, we further amended the Credit Agreement to provide for an additional $50.0 million term loan, the proceeds of which were also used to fund a distribution to the holders of our Series A preferred stock, and to extend the maturity date to October 9, 2018. On July 23, 2015, we amended the Credit Agreement in order to permit the merger of BHI Intermediate Holding Corp., our former wholly owned subsidiary into us. On September 25, 2015, we further amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, extend the maturity date on the Credit Agreement to October 9, 2020 and lower the applicable interest rate. We had $200.2 million of outstanding term loans and no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of December 27, 2015.\nIf the lease is classified as a capital lease, we record the present value of the minimum lease payments and a related capital lease obligation on our consolidated balance sheet. The asset is then amortized over the lesser of the economic life of the asset or the lease term. Rent payments for these properties are not recorded as rent expense, but rather are recognized as a reduction of the capital lease obligation and as interest expense.\nFinancing Activities\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $10.7 million during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The increase is due primarily to $4.6 million in legal, accounting and other expenses directly related to public offerings, $0.7 million of stock-based compensation expense as a result of the vesting of certain performance\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement are allowed under base rate and Eurodollar rate loans. Base rate loans bear interest at the higher of (1) the Bank of America prime rate, (2) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, or (3) the LIBOR rate for one-month loans plus 1.00% and an applicable rate. Eurodollar rate loans may be entered or converted into one-, two-, three-, or six-month periods and are charged interest at the LIBOR rate on the effective date for the period selected, plus an applicable rate. As of December 27, 2015, all of our outstanding term loan debt was in one-month Eurodollar loans with an interest rate of approximately 2.48%.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and of stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nInvesting Activities\n (a) Includes certain professional fees and transaction costs related to financing transactions, acquisitions and public offering expenses and third-party consultants for one-time projects. \nRestaurant Depreciation and Amortization\nFair Value Measurements\nCompany restaurant revenues consist of sales of food and beverages in company-operated restaurants. Company restaurant revenues in a period are influenced by several factors, including the number of operating weeks in such period, the number of open restaurants and comparable restaurant sales growth.\nLong-lived assets such as property, equipment and intangible assets are reviewed on a unit-by-unit basis for impairment. When circumstances indicate a carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable, an appropriate impairment is recorded.\nWe recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at their fair values. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined using an income approach using the following significant inputs: the term of the swaps, the notional amount of the swaps, and the rate on the fixed leg of the swaps.\n (k) Includes the cost of the purchase of equipment for franchisees in connection with a one-time initiative which was completed in fiscal 2013. \n (d) Represents a payment liability pursuant to an employment agreement. \nOther Depreciation and Amortization\nRestaurant depreciation and amortization increased $1.7 million during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, due primarily to the increased number of company-operated restaurants and our new point-of-sale system. As a percentage of company restaurant revenues, depreciation and amortization was 2.5% and 2.4% during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively.\nContractual Obligations\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from $37.9 million during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2013 to $41.6 million during the fiscal year ended December 28, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash generated from our operations due to the net increase in company-operated restaurants, franchise royalty revenues and an increase in comparable restaurant sales.\n (c) Includes non-cash, stock-based compensation related to the vesting of certain performance based stock option awards, as well as employer payroll taxes associated with stock option exercises related to stock options that were outstanding prior to our IPO. \nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (\u201cASU 2015-17\u201d). ASU 2015-17 requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in ASU 2015-17. ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted and the standard may be applied either retrospectively or on a prospective basis to all deferred tax assets and liabilities. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe consider net income to be a key performance indicator that shows the overall health of our entire business. We typically utilize net income in conjunction with the non-GAAP financial measures Pro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA when assessing the operational strength and the performance of our business.\nFranchise Royalty Revenues\nAmortization of Deferred Debt Issuance Costs\nStock-Based Compensation\n (e) Includes legal and other expenses incurred in connection with the transition to our new distributor. \nCompany restaurant revenues increased $53.2 million, or 15.0%, in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. The growth in company restaurant revenues was primarily due to an increase in comparable company restaurant sales of $13.5 million, or 4.0%, composed of increases in price, mix and transactions at our comparable company restaurants, and an increase in the non-comparable restaurant base (net additions of 29 company-operated restaurants as of December 28, 2014 compared to December 29, 2013) accounting for $39.7 million.\nFranchise royalty and other franchise revenues represents royalty income, and initial and renewal franchise fees. While we expect the majority of our total revenue growth will be driven by company-operated restaurants, our franchised restaurants and growth in franchise royalty and other franchise revenues remain an important part of our financial success.\nInterest Expense\nRestaurant depreciation and amortization increased $0.7 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, due primarily to the increased number of company-operated restaurants. As a percentage of company restaurant revenues, depreciation and amortization was 2.4% and 2.5% in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively.\nCertain leases contain rent escalation clauses based on escalation terms. The excess of cumulative rent expense over cumulative rent payments made on leases with fixed escalation terms is recognized as deferred rents within other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets. Contingent rentals are generally based on sales levels in excess of stipulated amounts, and thus are not considered minimum lease payments at lease inception. We recognize contingent rent expense when it is deemed probable.\n (b) Reflects an estimate of recurring incremental legal, accounting, insurance and other operating and compliance costs we expect to incur as a public company in addition to actual amounts incurred. By its nature, this adjustment involves risks and uncertainties, and the actual costs incurred could be different than this adjustment. \n\nCompany Restaurant Depreciation and Amortization\nThe following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations for Bojangles', Inc. (\u201cBojangles'\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report. In this annual report, unless the context otherwise requires, references to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour\u201d mean the Company, together with its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis.\n \u2022 bankruptcy proceedings or other significant financial distress; \nIncome Taxes\nAdditionally, we review leases for which we are involved in construction to determine whether build-to-suit and sale-leaseback criteria are met. For those leases that trigger specific build-to-suit accounting, we are considered the accounting owner of the construction project and in such cases, developer's construction costs are capitalized, including the value of costs incurred up to the date we execute our lease and costs incurred during the remainder of the construction period, as such costs are incurred. During the construction period an offsetting liability is recognized as a financing lease obligation for the construction costs incurred by the developer. The construction period begins when we execute our lease agreement with the property owner and continues until the space is substantially complete and ready for its intended use.\nGeneral and administrative expenses include expenses associated with corporate and administrative functions that support our operations, including compensation and benefits, travel expense, stock-based compensation expense, legal and professional fees, training, and other corporate costs. We expect we will incur incremental increases in general and administrative expenses as a result of operating as a public company.\nWe lease restaurant land and buildings, certain restaurant, office and point-of-sale equipment, office space and vehicles under operating and capital leases. Accounting for leased properties requires compliance with technical accounting rules and significant judgment by management. Application of these accounting rules and assumptions made by management will determine whether we are considered the owner for accounting purposes or whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or as a capital lease.\nComparable restaurant sales reflects the change in year-over-year sales for the comparable restaurant base. A restaurant enters our comparable restaurant base the first full day of the month after being open for 15 months using a mid-month convention. While we do not record franchised sales as revenues, our royalty revenues are calculated based on a percentage of franchised restaurant sales.\nKey Financial Definitions\n Restaurant Openings\nInterest expense decreased $0.8 million during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The decrease was due primarily to principal payments of $28.1 million on our long-term debt and a reduction in our applicable rate, partially offset by an increase in capital lease obligations during fiscal 2015.\nFood and supplies costs include the direct costs associated with food, beverage and packaging of our menu items at company-operated restaurants. The components of food and supplies are variable in nature, change with sales volume, are affected by menu mix and are subject to fluctuations in commodity costs.\nWe expect our recurring general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we grow our business and incur additional expenses related to being a newer public company.\nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment, and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment, we first compare undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.\n (f) Represents the elimination of a gain from the termination of a contract with a beverage vendor. \nFood and Supplies Costs\nFood and supplies costs increased $17.4 million during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in company restaurant revenues and a $1.5 million gain associated with the termination of a beverage vendor contract during fiscal 2014, which was recorded as a reduction to food and supplies costs. Excluding the impact of the $1.5 million gain associated with the termination of a beverage vendor contract, food and supplies costs as a percentage of company restaurant revenues during fiscal 2014 was 33.1% versus 32.6% during fiscal 2015. This percentage decrease was primarily due to our menu price increases, partially offset by commodity price increases.\nRestaurant Depreciation and Amortization\nNet cash used in investing activities increased from $8.6 million for fiscal 2013 to $10.7 million for fiscal 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the assets of eight Bojangles' restaurants from a franchisee in April 2014 for the purchase price of approximately $3.8 million of which approximately $0.6 million was deferred, a reduction in proceeds from disposition of property and equipment of approximately $0.8 million, offset by a decrease in purchases of property and equipment of approximately $1.9 million.\n (1) Includes estimated interest payments calculated based on current interest rates as of December 27, 2015. Interest includes interest and fees under our credit facility and our interest rate swaps. \nSystem-wide Average Unit Volumes\nOperating Costs\nPro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this Form 10-K are supplemental measures of our performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Pro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. In addition, in evaluating Pro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses or charges such as those added back to calculate Pro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Pro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nResults of Operations\nWe record the stock-based awards on the fair value of the shares at the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures, less the amount that the employee is required to pay. In order to calculate our stock options' fair values and the associated compensation costs for share-based awards, we utilize the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, and we have developed estimates of various inputs including expected term, expected volatility and risk-free interest rate. These assumptions generally require significant judgment. The forfeiture rate is based on historical rates and reduces the compensation expense recognized. The expected term for options granted is derived using the \u201csimplified\u201d method, in accordance with SEC guidance. Expected volatility is estimated using publicly-traded peer companies in our market category. Volatility is calculated with reference to the historical daily closing equity prices of our peer companies, prior to the grant date, over a period equal to the expected term. We calculate the risk-free interest rate using the implied yield for a U.S. Treasury security with constant maturity and a remaining term equal to the expected term of our employee stock options. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero for option valuation purposes.\nEmerging Growth Company\nWe use interest-rate-related derivative instruments to manage our exposure related to changes in interest rates on our variable-rate debt instruments. We do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging. For all hedging relationships, we formally document the hedging relationship and risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the hedging instrument, the hedged transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, how the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively, and a description of the method used to measure ineffectiveness. We also formally assess, both at the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging relationships are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged transactions.\n (d) Includes expenses directly associated with the opening of company-operated restaurants and incurred prior to the opening of a company-operated restaurant. \nRestaurant labor costs, including preopening labor, consist of company-operated restaurant-level management and hourly labor costs, including salaries, wages, payroll taxes, workers' compensation expense, benefits and bonuses paid to our company-operated restaurant-level team members. Like other cost items, we expect restaurant labor costs at our company-operated restaurants to grow due to inflation and as our company restaurant revenues grows. Factors that influence labor costs include minimum wage and employer payroll tax legislation, health care costs and the performance of our restaurants. The PPACA has increased health care costs for our restaurants in fiscal 2015.\nPro Forma Net Income represents company net income before items that we do not consider representative of our ongoing operating performance, as well as an estimate of recurring incremental legal, accounting, insurance and other operating and compliance costs we expect to incur as a public company for those periods where they had not yet been incurred, both as identified in the reconciliation table below. Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share represents company diluted net income per share before items that we do not consider representative of our ongoing operating performance, as well as an estimate of recurring incremental legal, accounting, insurance and other operating and compliance costs we expect to incur as a public company for those periods where they had not yet been incurred, both as identified in the reconciliation table below.\n (g) Represents a payment liability pursuant to an employment agreement. \nWe state the value of our long-lived assets at cost, minus accumulated depreciation and amortization. We calculate depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. We amortize our leasehold improvements using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term (including reasonably assured renewal periods) or the estimated useful lives of the related assets. We expense repairs and maintenance as incurred, but capitalize major improvements and betterments.\n (e) Includes reimbursement of expenses to our sponsor prior to our IPO, compensation and expense reimbursement to members of our board prior to our IPO and certain non-recurring executive search firm fees incurred on behalf of our board. \nWe could remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until December 27, 2020 or until the earliest of (a) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (b) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (c) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities in the preceding three-year period.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor derivative instruments designated in a cash flow hedging relationship, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.\nIncome taxes represent federal, state, and local current and deferred income tax expense.\nThe table below summarizes our contractual commitments to make future payments pursuant to our long-term debt and other obligations including operating lease obligations, capital lease obligations, marketing commitments and financing obligations under build-to-suit leases outstanding as of December 27, 2015, our most recent fiscal year-end for which a balance sheet is presented. The table does not include any new transactions after the fiscal year ended December 27, 2015 including, but not limited to, new operating and capital leases, new marketing commitments and new financing obligations under build-to-suit leases:\nNew Accounting Standards\nBojangles' is a highly differentiated and growing restaurant operator and franchisor dedicated to serving customers high-quality, craveable food made from our Southern recipes. We opened our first store in Charlotte, North Carolina in 1977 and, as of December 27, 2015, have expanded our system-wide restaurants to 662 across eleven states, the District of Columbia and Roatan Island, Honduras. Our system of restaurants, which includes both company-operated and franchised restaurants, generated approximately $1.2 billion of system-wide sales during fiscal year 2015. We offer fast-casual quality food and preparation combined with quick-service speed, convenience and value.\nWe currently expect our cash capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 will range between $12.5 million and $13.5 million excluding approximately $1.7 million to $1.8 million of restaurant preopening expenses for restaurants that are not capitalized. These capital estimates are based on restaurant capital expenditures for the opening of 28 to 29 company-operated restaurants as well as investments to remodel and improve our existing restaurants, and for general corporate purposes.\n \u2022 the valuation of our common stock by an unrelated third-party valuation firm for all stock options awarded in fiscal 2014; ", "item_7_text": "Company Restaurant Revenues\nCompany Restaurant Revenues\nImpairment\nThe following tables set forth reconciliations of net income to Pro Forma Net Income and diluted net income per share to Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share:\nDeferred debt issuance costs are amortized over the term of the related debt on the effective interest method.\nRestaurant Labor Costs\nNet cash used in financing activities increased from $26.2 million during the fiscal year ended December 28, 2014 to $32.3 million during the fiscal year ended December 27, 2015. This increase was primarily due to a $6.7 million increase in principal payments on long-term debt and a $0.7 million increase in principal payments on capital lease obligations, partially offset by a $0.6 million increase in excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation and $0.3 million of proceeds from stock option exercises.\nFranchise Fee and Royalty Accounting\nterminated. The commencement of operations by the franchisee indicates substantial performance has occurred. If substantial performance of our obligations has not been completed, revenues are not recognized and the amount received is deferred until all material services or conditions have been satisfied by us or the franchise development agreement is terminated. Continuing franchise royalty revenues are recognized on the accrual basis and are based on a percentage of monthly sales, generally ranging from 3% to 4% for franchisees operating within the United States of America, and 5% for franchisees with operations in other countries.\nRestaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are supplemental measures of operating performance of our restaurants and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to those reported by other companies. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We believe that restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are important tools for investors as they are widely-used metrics within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant-level productivity, efficiency and performance. We use restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin as key metrics to evaluate profitability and performance of our restaurants across periods and to evaluate our restaurant financial performance compared to our competitors.\nTo evaluate the performance of our business, we utilize a variety of financial and performance measures. These key measures include company restaurant revenues, franchise royalty and other franchise revenues, system-wide AUVs, comparable restaurant sales, restaurant openings and net income. In addition, we also evaluate Pro Forma Net Income and Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, and restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin which are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe Pro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. These potential differences may be caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses) and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense). We also present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because (i) we believe these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry, (ii) we believe investors will find these measures useful in assessing our ability to service or incur indebtedness, and (iii) we use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA internally as benchmarks to evaluate our operating performance or compare our performance to that of our competitors.\nRestaurant Labor Costs\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718). The new guidance provides new criteria for accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period. The amendments require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period is treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Topic 718 as it relates to awards with performance conditions and compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved. The standard will be effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect to early adopt this guidance and do not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOther depreciation and amortization primarily consists of the depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets not directly located at company-operated restaurants.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (\u201cASU 2016-02\u201d). ASU 2016-02 is a comprehensive new leases standard that amends various aspects of existing guidance for leases and requires additional disclosures about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 will require companies to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. ASU 2016-02 retains a distinction between finance leases and operating leases. The classification criteria for distinguishing between finance leases and operating leases are substantially similar to the classification criteria for distinguishing between capital leases and operating leases in the previous leases guidance. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.\n (h) Includes legal and other expenses incurred in connection with the transition to our new distributor. \n (i) Includes loss on disposal of property and equipment, impairment and cash proceeds on disposals from disposition of property and equipment. \nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\nOperating costs increased $13.3 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to higher company restaurant revenues. As a percentage of company restaurant revenues, operating costs increased to 21.7% for fiscal 2014 from 21.3% in fiscal 2013. This increase was primarily attributable to new company-operated restaurants having higher occupancy costs as a percentage of company restaurant revenues, partially offset by leveraging comparable company restaurant sales growth.\n (f) Includes certain professional fees and transaction costs related to financing transactions, acquisitions and public offering expenses, third-party consultants for one-time projects and certain executive relocation costs. \nRestaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Restaurant contribution is defined as company restaurant revenues less food and supplies costs, restaurant labor costs, and operating costs. We expect restaurant contribution to increase based on company-operated restaurants we open and our comparable restaurant sales growth. Restaurant contribution margin is defined as restaurant contribution as a percentage of company restaurant revenues. Fluctuations in restaurant contribution margin can be attributed to company comparable restaurant sales growth, sales volumes of newly opened company restaurants, and changes in company food and supplies costs, restaurant labor costs and operating costs.\nOperating costs increased $12.4 million during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to higher company restaurant revenues. As a percentage of company restaurant revenues, operating costs increased to 21.8% for fiscal 2015 from 21.7% in fiscal 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in local store marketing and occupancy costs, partially offset by leveraging comparable company restaurant sales growth.\n \u2022 the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or sale of our company, given prevailing market conditions. \nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\n (g) As a result of enacted reductions to the North Carolina corporate income tax rate, we adjusted our deferred income taxes during the fiscal years ended December 27, 2015 and December 29, 2013 by applying the lower rate, which resulted in a corresponding decrease to income tax expense. \nFair value is the price the company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants. For those assets and liabilities recorded or disclosed at fair value, we determine fair value based upon the quoted market price, if available. If a quoted market price is not available for identical assets or liabilities, we determine fair value based upon the quoted market price of similar assets or liabilities or the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved, including counterparty performance risk, if appropriate, and using discount rates appropriate for the duration. The fair values are assigned a level within the fair value hierarchy depending on the source of the inputs into the calculation.\n \u2022 our expectation to dispose of long-lived assets before the end of their estimated useful lives, even though the assets do not meet the criteria to be classified as \u201cheld for sale.\u201d \n \u2022 the fact that the option grants involved illiquid securities in a private company; \nIf in the future we determine that another method is more reasonable, or if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance, and, therefore, should be used to estimate volatility or expected life, the fair value calculated for our stock options could change significantly. Higher volatility and longer expected lives result in an increase in stock-based compensation expense determined at the date of grant. Stock-based compensation expense affects our general and administrative expenses.\n (a) Includes amortization of deferred debt issuance costs. \n (j) Represents the elimination of a gain from the termination of a contract with a beverage vendor. \nOur discussion and analysis of operating results and financial condition are based upon our financial statements. The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis.\nDebt Covenants\nThe following is the number of Bojangles' company-operated, franchised and system-wide restaurants at the beginning and end of fiscal 2013, 2014 and 2015:\nWe recorded impairment charges of $1.2 million, $0.5 million and $0.7 million due to underperforming restaurants during the fiscal years ended December 27, 2015, December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013, respectively. The impaired assets had no value at December 27, 2015.\n\nPrior to our IPO, it was necessary to estimate the fair value of the common stock underlying our equity awards when computing fair value calculations under the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The fair value of our common stock was assessed on each grant date by our board of directors. Given the absence of an active market for our common stock, our board of directors estimated our common stock's fair value based on an analysis of a number of objective and subjective factors that they believed that market participants would consider in valuing it, including the following:\nTotal Revenues\nFiscal Year 2015 Compared to Fiscal Year 2014\nOperating results for any one fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other fiscal year and our key performance indicators, as discussed below, may decrease for any future period. Unless otherwise stated, comparable restaurant sales and average unit volumes are presented on a system-wide basis, which means they include sales at both company-operated restaurants and franchised restaurants. Franchise sales represent sales at all franchised restaurants and are revenues to our franchisees. We do not record franchise sales as revenues; however, our franchise royalty revenues include royalties based on a percentage of franchise sales.\nOur operating results for the fiscal years ended December 27, 2015 and December 28, 2014 are compared below:\nOur impairment review for goodwill consists of a qualitative assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, and if required, followed by a two-step process of determining the fair value and comparing it to the carrying value of the net assets. If the qualitative assessment demonstrates that it is more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value, it is not necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. We may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the two-step process in any period. We can resume the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. When performing the two-step process, if the fair value exceeds its carrying value, no further analysis or write-down of goodwill is required. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of its net assets, the estimated fair value is allocated to all its underlying assets and liabilities, including both recognized and unrecognized tangible and intangible assets, based on their fair value. If necessary, goodwill is then written down to its implied fair value. Our impairment review for our brand consists of a qualitative assessment similar to goodwill and, if necessary, a comparison of the fair value of our brand with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. If the fair value exceeds its carrying amount, our brand is not considered impaired.\n \u2022 the hiring of key personnel; \nCompany Restaurant Revenues\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $4.6 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. The increase is due primarily to additional positions added to support an increased number of restaurants in our system, increased stock-based compensation expense of $0.6 million and employee relocation cost increase of $0.7 million. As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses were 7.5% and 7.3% in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively.\n (i) Represents a net gain from insurance proceeds associated with a fire at a company-operated restaurant. \n Operating Activities\nLong-Lived Assets\nFranchise Royalty and Other Franchise Revenues\nFranchise royalty revenues increased $2.2 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. The increase was primarily due to an additional 16 franchised restaurants at December 28, 2014 compared to December 29, 2013 and franchised comparable restaurant sales growth of 5.0%.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur growth plan is dependent upon many factors, including economic conditions, real estate markets, restaurant locations and the nature of our lease agreements. Our capital expenditure outlays are also dependent on costs for maintenance in our existing restaurants as well as information technology and other general corporate expenditures. We primarily utilize build-to-suit developments and equipment financing leases for our new company-operated restaurants, requiring minimal upfront cash investment. While we currently utilize a build-to-suit development strategy, our new restaurant strategy may change over time.\nWe measure system-wide AUVs on a fiscal year basis and on a trailing twelve month basis for each non-fiscal year-end period for system-wide restaurants. Annual AUVs are calculated using the following methodology: first, we determine the domestic free-standing restaurants with both a drive-thru and interior seating that have been open for a full 12 month period (excluding express units); and second, we calculate the revenues for these restaurants and divide by the number of restaurants in that base to arrive at our AUV calculation. This methodology is similar for each trailing twelve month period outside the fiscal year end.\n (h) Includes the cost of the purchase of equipment for franchisees in connection with a one-time initiative which was completed in fiscal 2013. \nFood and Supplies Costs\nInterest expense increased $0.7 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. The increase was due primarily to an amendment to our credit facility in May 2013 borrowing an additional $50.0 million partially offset by a reduction in our interest rate, and another amendment in April 2014 borrowing an additional $50.0 million, partially offset by repayment of $21.4 million in fiscal 2014.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased from $10.7 million during the fiscal year ended December 28, 2014 to $12.2 million during the fiscal year ended December 27, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in purchases of property and equipment of $4.6 million, partially offset by a $3.0 million decrease in the purchase of a franchisee's assets.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nEBITDA represents company net income before interest expense (net of interest income), provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents company net income before interest expense (net of interest income), provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, items that we do not consider representative of our ongoing operating performance and certain non-cash items, as identified in the reconciliation table below.\nOperating Costs\nWe discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when we determine that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, the cash flow hedge is de-designated because a forecasted transaction is not probable of occurring, or management determines to remove the designation of the cash flow hedge.\nAccounting policies are an integral part of our financial statements. A thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial position. Management believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve the most difficult management judgments due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions used. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more information about our significant accounting policies.\nOperating Costs\nBefore our IPO, we historically granted stock options with exercise prices not less than the fair value of our common stock underlying such stock options, as determined on the date of grant by our board of directors, with input from our management and from an independent third-party valuation expert for stock options awarded in fiscal 2014 only.\nIncome Taxes\n (c) Includes non-cash, stock-based compensation, as well as employer payroll taxes associated with stock option exercises related to stock options that were outstanding prior to our IPO. \nIncome Taxes\nLeases\n (j) Represents the income tax (expense) benefit associated with the adjustments in (a) through (i) that are deductible for income tax purposes. \nIn April 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest (\u201cASU 2015-03\u201d). The standard requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts or premiums. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. We adopted this guidance during our first fiscal quarter of 2016, and the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330) (\u201cASU 2015-11\u201d). The pronouncement was issued to simplify the measurement of inventory and changes the measurement from lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value. This pronouncement is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The adoption of ASU 2015-11 is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\n\n n/m = not meaningful\n Comparable Restaurant Sales\nawards, $0.6 million of legal and other expenses incurred in connection with the transition to a new distributor, a $0.5 million accrual pursuant to an employment agreement, additional positions added to support an increased number of restaurants in our system, and additional costs as a result of operating as a public company. As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses were 8.8% and 7.5% during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively.\n \u2022 financial metrics, including, but not limited to, our results of operations; \n A relocation results in a closure and an opening. During the fiscal years ended December 27, 2015, December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013, our franchisees closed 20, 4 and 5 restaurants, respectively, of which 7, 1 and 1, respectively, were relocations. During the fiscal years ended December 27, 2015, December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013, we closed 3, 3 and 2 Company-operated restaurants, respectively, of which 3, 2 and 2, respectively were relocations.\nWe maintain allowances, which management believes are adequate to absorb estimated losses to be incurred in realizing the recorded amounts of its accounts receivable. These allowances are determined by management based primarily on an analysis of collectability of individual accounts and historical trends.\nCompany restaurant revenues increased $55.4 million, or 13.6%, during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The growth in company restaurant revenues was primarily due to an increase in comparable company restaurant sales of $14.1 million, or 3.6%, composed of increases in price and mix at our comparable company restaurants, and an increase in the non-comparable restaurant base (net additions of 27 company-operated restaurants as of December 27, 2015 compared to December 28, 2014) accounting for $41.3 million.\nThe following table reconciles our restaurant contribution to the line item on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income entitled \u201cCompany restaurant revenues,\u201d which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP measure on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nPro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are (i) they do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, (ii) they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs, (iii) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt, (iv) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Pro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements, (v) they do not adjust for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows, (vi) they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations, and (vii) other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nNet Income, Pro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nInterest expense primarily consists of interest on our debt outstanding under our credit facility and capital lease obligations.\nOur operating results for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013 are compared below:\nHedging Arrangements\nThe following table presents summary cash flow information for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nThere were no stock options granted during the fiscal year ended December 27, 2015. The assumptions used for grants made during the fiscal years ended December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013 are provided in the following table:\nThe estimated fair value is the amount for which the business could be sold in market. We estimate the fair value using a combination of market earnings multiples and discounted cash flow methodologies. This requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth of our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment.\nOur Credit Agreement contains various covenants that, among other things, do not allow us to exceed a maximum consolidated total lease adjusted leverage ratio, requires us to maintain a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, and place certain limitations on cash capital expenditures. We were in compliance with all of the covenants under our Credit Agreement as of December 27, 2015.\nInterest Expense\nWe grant franchises to individual restaurant operators in exchange for initial franchise license fees and continuing royalty payments. We account for initial franchisee fees in accordance with FASB ASC 952, Franchisors. Franchise license fees are deferred when received and recognized as revenues when substantial performance of all franchisor obligations have been achieved or the franchise development agreement is\nKey Performance Indicators\nCompany-operated restaurant labor increased $13.9 million during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to higher company restaurant revenues and increased health care costs. As a percentage of company restaurant revenues, restaurant labor costs decreased to 27.3% in fiscal 2015 from 27.7% in fiscal 2014. This decrease was primarily driven by an increase in comparable company restaurant sales which resulted in leveraging certain fixed labor expenses and a reduction in payroll taxes, partially offset by an increase in health care costs related to enrollment from the PPACA and higher medical claims.\n (b) Includes deferred rent, which represents the extent to which our rent expense has been above or below our cash rent payments, amortization of favorable (unfavorable) leases and closed store reserves for rent net of cash payments. \nFranchise Royalty Revenues\nCompany restaurant depreciation and amortization primarily consists of the depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets at the restaurant level.\nWe did not grant any stock options to employees, officers or board members during the fiscal year ended December 27, 2015. We granted 1,155,022 and 143,613 stock options to employees, officers and board members during the fiscal years ended December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013, respectively. Stock option holders forfeited 6,732, 408,047 and 26,927 stock options during the fiscal years ended December 27, 2015, December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense of approximately $2.0 million, $1.4 million and $0.8 million for the fiscal years ended December 27, 2015, December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013, respectively, is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\n (1) Fiscal 2014 includes a one-time reduction in food and supplies cost of approximately $1.5 million resulting from the termination of a vendor contract. \nDebt and Other Obligations\nCompany-operated restaurant labor increased $13.1 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to higher company restaurant revenues. As a percentage of company restaurant revenues, restaurant labor costs decreased to 27.7% in fiscal 2014 from 28.1% in fiscal 2013. This decrease was primarily driven by an increase in comparable company restaurant sales which resulted in leveraging certain fixed labor expenses.\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from such non-GAAP financial measures. We further compensate for the limitations in our use of non-GAAP financial measures by presenting comparable GAAP measures more prominently.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from $41.6 million during the fiscal year ended December 28, 2014 to $45.5 million during the fiscal year ended December 27, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash generated from our operations due to the net increase in company-operated restaurants, franchise royalty revenues and an increase in comparable restaurant sales, partially offset by the costs associated with our IPO.\nCredit Agreement\nFood and Supplies Costs\nFranchise royalty revenues increased $2.4 million during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The increase was primarily due to an additional net 13 franchised restaurants at December 27, 2015 compared to December 28, 2014 and franchised comparable restaurant sales growth of 4.4%.\nLoss (Gain) on Disposal of Property and Equipment\nOur primary requirements for liquidity and capital are new company-operated restaurants, existing restaurant capital investments (remodels and maintenance), information technology investments, principal and interest payments on our term debt and capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations and working capital and general corporate needs. Our customers pay for their purchases in cash or by payment card (credit or debit) at the time of sale. Therefore, we are able to sell many of our inventory items before we have to pay our suppliers for such items. Our restaurants do not require significant inventories or receivables. We do have accounts receivable from our franchisees primarily related to royalty revenues, as well as from certain vendors.\nInterest Expense\nSeasonal factors cause our revenues to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our revenues per restaurant are typically lower in the first quarter. As a result, our quarterly and annual operating results and key performance indicators may fluctuate significantly.\nThe FASB has recently issued or discussed a number of proposed standards on such topics as consolidation, financial statement presentation, financial instruments and hedging. Some of the proposed changes are significant and could have a material impact on our reporting. We have not yet fully evaluated the potential impact of all these proposals, but will make such an evaluation as the standards are finalized.\n (2) Includes commitments for various marketing sponsorships and expenses.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n \u2022 significant negative industry or economic trends; \nSome of the events or changes in circumstances that would trigger an impairment test include, but are not limited to:\nRent expense for operating leases that contain scheduled rent increases is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the respective lease. Favorable lease assets and unfavorable lease liabilities were recorded in connection with the acquisition of the company by Advent and other stockholders in 2011. We amortize favorable and unfavorable leases on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the leases. Upon early termination of a lease, the write-off of the favorable or unfavorable lease carrying value associated with the lease is recognized as a loss or gain in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This update was issued to replace the current revenue recognition guidance, creating a more comprehensive revenue model. This update was originally to be effective in fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early application was not permitted. In July 2015, the FASB affirmed its proposal to defer the effective date by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The FASB also affirmed its proposal to permit early adoption of the standard, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements.\nLoss (gain) on disposal of property and equipment includes the net loss (gain) on disposal of assets related to retirements and replacements or write-off of leasehold improvements, equipment and other fixed assets. These losses (gains) are related to normal disposals in the ordinary course of business and gains from insurance proceeds, if any.\nIn all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, we continue to carry the derivative at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and recognize any subsequent changes in its fair value in earnings.\n \u2022 the risks inherent in the development and expansion of our food and services; and \nWe determined the fair value of our goodwill and the fair value of our brand and both were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values when we performed our annual goodwill and brand impairment tests as of December 1, 2015. As such, we have determined that no impairment to our goodwill or our brand occurred during the fiscal years ended December 27, 2015, December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013.\nIncome taxes increased $0.4 million during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. Our effective income tax rates were 37.7% and 37.4% during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively. The increase was primarily due to expenses incurred related to the IPO for which we will not receive a tax deduction, which was partially offset by the recognition of certain tax credits and a reduction in the North Carolina corporate income tax rate.\nThe number of restaurant openings reflects the number of restaurants opened during a particular reporting period. Before we open company-operated restaurants, we incur preopening expenses. System-wide, some of our restaurants open with an initial start-up period of higher than normal sales volume, which subsequently decreases to stabilized levels. Newly opened restaurants typically have lower annual sales volumes than our established company-operated restaurants. Newly opened company-operated restaurants typically experience normal inefficiencies such as higher food and supplies, labor and other direct operating costs and, as a result, restaurant contribution margins are typically lower during the start-up period of operations. In addition, newly opened restaurants typically have high occupancy costs compared to existing restaurants. When entering new markets, we may be exposed to longer start-up times and lower contribution margins than reflected in our average historical experience.\nThe following table sets forth reconciliations of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\n\nRestaurant operating costs include all other company-operated restaurant-level operating expenses, such as repairs and maintenance, utilities, credit and debit card processing, occupancy expenses and other restaurant operating costs. In addition, our advertising costs are included in operating costs and are comprised of our company-operated restaurants' portion of spending on all advertising which includes, but is not limited to, television, radio, social media, billboards, point-of-sale materials, sponsorships, and creation of media, such as commercials and marketing campaigns.\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased from $29.5 million during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2013 to $26.2 million during the fiscal year ended December 28, 2014. This decrease was primarily due to a $4.0 million decrease in principal payments on long-term debt, partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in principal payments on capital lease obligations.\nIncome taxes increased $5.7 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. For fiscal 2014, our effective income tax rate was 37.4%, compared to an effective tax rate of 29.0% for fiscal 2013. The lower effective income tax rate in fiscal 2013 was primarily due to a state income tax rate reduction enacted by the State of North Carolina which resulted in a deferred income tax benefit.\nRestaurant Labor Costs\nOnce construction is complete, we are required to perform a sale-leaseback analysis to determine if we can remove the developer's assets and associated financing obligations from the balance sheet. If, in such cases, we maintain any form of \u201ccontinuing involvement\u201d in the property, it would preclude us from derecognizing the asset and associated financing obligations following the completion of construction. In those cases, we will continue to account for the asset as if we are the legal owner, and the financing obligation similar to other debt, until the lease expires or is modified to remove the continuing involvement that prohibits derecognition. If there is no \u201ccontinuing involvement\u201d and derecognition is permitted, we would be required to account for the lease as either operating or capital.\nRestaurant Contribution and Restaurant Contribution Margin\nLevel 1 - Inputs based upon quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nIn connection with our Credit Agreement, we have three variable-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in the benchmark interest rate of LIBOR as of December 27, 2015. On May 17, 2013, we entered into an interest rate swap contract with a notional amount of $50.0 million, an effective date of November 30, 2015 and a termination date of September 29, 2017, under which we pay a fixed interest rate of 1.3325% and receive the one-month LIBOR rate. Also on May 17, 2013, we entered into a second interest rate swap contract with an effective date of May 31, 2013, a termination date of May 31, 2017 and a notional amount of $25.0 million, under which we pay interest fixed at 0.70125% and receive the one-month LIBOR rate. On October 26, 2015, we entered into a third interest rate swap contract with an effective date of October 30, 2015, a termination date of October 31, 2019 and a notional amount of $50.0 million, under which we pay interest fixed at 1.115% and receive the one-month LIBOR rate.\nOverview\nFood and supplies costs increased $14.6 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in company restaurant revenues. For fiscal 2014, food and supplies costs as a percentage of company restaurant revenues were 32.7% compared to 33.5% in fiscal 2013. This percentage decrease was primarily due to a $1.5 million gain associated with the termination of a beverage vendor contract which was recognized as an offset to food and supplies costs. Additionally, our menu price increase more than offset our commodity cost increases.\nOur revenues are derived from two primary sources: company restaurant revenues and franchise revenues. Franchise revenues are comprised of franchise royalty revenues and, to a lesser extent, other franchise revenues which include initial and renewal franchisee fees.\nWe believe that cash and cash equivalents and expected cash flow from operations are adequate to fund debt service requirements, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations, capital expenditures and working capital needs for at least the next 12 months. However, our ability to continue to meet these requirements and obligations will depend on, among other things, our ability to achieve anticipated levels of revenues and cash flow from operations, our ability to manage costs and working capital successfully and the continued availability of build-to-suit and equipment financing leases for our new company-operated restaurants. We have used excess cash flows to make payments on our outstanding long-term debt in advance of the required due date, and we may continue to do so in future periods.\nLevel 3 - Inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability.\n \u2022 knowledge of transactions involving the sale of similar property at amounts below our carrying value; or \n n/m = not meaningful\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets Not Subject to Amortization\nFiscal Year 2014 Compared to Fiscal Year 2013\nThe lease term for all types of leases begins on the date we become legally obligated for the rent payments or we take possession of the building or land, whichever is earlier.\nThe excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles in a business combination is recorded as goodwill. In addition to goodwill, our indefinite-lived intangible asset consists of the Bojangles' brand. We do not amortize our goodwill and brand. We perform an impairment test for goodwill and our brand annually as of December 1 and when a triggering event occurs or change in circumstances indicates that impairment might exist. Such events or circumstances may be a significant change in business climate, economic and industry trends, legal factors, negative operating performance indicators, significant competition, changes in strategy or disposition.\nWe have guaranteed through 2018 debt from a previous credit facility which was assumed by a franchisee. We may be required to perform this guarantee in the event of default or nonperformance of this franchisee. We have determined that default by the franchisee is unlikely due to timely and consistent payments, and have therefore not recorded a liability for the debt assumed by this franchisee on our consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value of debt covered by this additional guarantee by us was approximately $0.1 million and $0.2 million at December 27, 2015 and December 28, 2014, respectively.\nOn October 9, 2012, we entered into a credit agreement (\u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with several financial institutions. The Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets and originally provided for borrowings under a term loan of $175.0 million, and a revolving credit facility of $25.0 million, with a maturity date of October 9, 2017. In May 2013, we amended the Credit Agreement to provide for an additional $50.0 million term loan, the proceeds of which were used to fund a distribution to the holders of our Series A preferred stock. In April 2014, we further amended the Credit Agreement to provide for an additional $50.0 million term loan, the proceeds of which were also used to fund a distribution to the holders of our Series A preferred stock, and to extend the maturity date to October 9, 2018. On July 23, 2015, we amended the Credit Agreement in order to permit the merger of BHI Intermediate Holding Corp., our former wholly owned subsidiary into us. On September 25, 2015, we further amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, extend the maturity date on the Credit Agreement to October 9, 2020 and lower the applicable interest rate. We had $200.2 million of outstanding term loans and no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of December 27, 2015.\nIf the lease is classified as a capital lease, we record the present value of the minimum lease payments and a related capital lease obligation on our consolidated balance sheet. The asset is then amortized over the lesser of the economic life of the asset or the lease term. Rent payments for these properties are not recorded as rent expense, but rather are recognized as a reduction of the capital lease obligation and as interest expense.\nFinancing Activities\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $10.7 million during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The increase is due primarily to $4.6 million in legal, accounting and other expenses directly related to public offerings, $0.7 million of stock-based compensation expense as a result of the vesting of certain performance\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement are allowed under base rate and Eurodollar rate loans. Base rate loans bear interest at the higher of (1) the Bank of America prime rate, (2) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, or (3) the LIBOR rate for one-month loans plus 1.00% and an applicable rate. Eurodollar rate loans may be entered or converted into one-, two-, three-, or six-month periods and are charged interest at the LIBOR rate on the effective date for the period selected, plus an applicable rate. As of December 27, 2015, all of our outstanding term loan debt was in one-month Eurodollar loans with an interest rate of approximately 2.48%.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and of stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nInvesting Activities\n (a) Includes certain professional fees and transaction costs related to financing transactions, acquisitions and public offering expenses and third-party consultants for one-time projects. \nRestaurant Depreciation and Amortization\nFair Value Measurements\nCompany restaurant revenues consist of sales of food and beverages in company-operated restaurants. Company restaurant revenues in a period are influenced by several factors, including the number of operating weeks in such period, the number of open restaurants and comparable restaurant sales growth.\nLong-lived assets such as property, equipment and intangible assets are reviewed on a unit-by-unit basis for impairment. When circumstances indicate a carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable, an appropriate impairment is recorded.\nWe recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at their fair values. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined using an income approach using the following significant inputs: the term of the swaps, the notional amount of the swaps, and the rate on the fixed leg of the swaps.\n (k) Includes the cost of the purchase of equipment for franchisees in connection with a one-time initiative which was completed in fiscal 2013. \n (d) Represents a payment liability pursuant to an employment agreement. \nOther Depreciation and Amortization\nRestaurant depreciation and amortization increased $1.7 million during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, due primarily to the increased number of company-operated restaurants and our new point-of-sale system. As a percentage of company restaurant revenues, depreciation and amortization was 2.5% and 2.4% during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively.\nContractual Obligations\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from $37.9 million during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2013 to $41.6 million during the fiscal year ended December 28, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash generated from our operations due to the net increase in company-operated restaurants, franchise royalty revenues and an increase in comparable restaurant sales.\n (c) Includes non-cash, stock-based compensation related to the vesting of certain performance based stock option awards, as well as employer payroll taxes associated with stock option exercises related to stock options that were outstanding prior to our IPO. \nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (\u201cASU 2015-17\u201d). ASU 2015-17 requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in ASU 2015-17. ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted and the standard may be applied either retrospectively or on a prospective basis to all deferred tax assets and liabilities. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe consider net income to be a key performance indicator that shows the overall health of our entire business. We typically utilize net income in conjunction with the non-GAAP financial measures Pro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA when assessing the operational strength and the performance of our business.\nFranchise Royalty Revenues\nAmortization of Deferred Debt Issuance Costs\nStock-Based Compensation\n (e) Includes legal and other expenses incurred in connection with the transition to our new distributor. \nCompany restaurant revenues increased $53.2 million, or 15.0%, in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. The growth in company restaurant revenues was primarily due to an increase in comparable company restaurant sales of $13.5 million, or 4.0%, composed of increases in price, mix and transactions at our comparable company restaurants, and an increase in the non-comparable restaurant base (net additions of 29 company-operated restaurants as of December 28, 2014 compared to December 29, 2013) accounting for $39.7 million.\nFranchise royalty and other franchise revenues represents royalty income, and initial and renewal franchise fees. While we expect the majority of our total revenue growth will be driven by company-operated restaurants, our franchised restaurants and growth in franchise royalty and other franchise revenues remain an important part of our financial success.\nInterest Expense\nRestaurant depreciation and amortization increased $0.7 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, due primarily to the increased number of company-operated restaurants. As a percentage of company restaurant revenues, depreciation and amortization was 2.4% and 2.5% in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively.\nCertain leases contain rent escalation clauses based on escalation terms. The excess of cumulative rent expense over cumulative rent payments made on leases with fixed escalation terms is recognized as deferred rents within other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets. Contingent rentals are generally based on sales levels in excess of stipulated amounts, and thus are not considered minimum lease payments at lease inception. We recognize contingent rent expense when it is deemed probable.\n (b) Reflects an estimate of recurring incremental legal, accounting, insurance and other operating and compliance costs we expect to incur as a public company in addition to actual amounts incurred. By its nature, this adjustment involves risks and uncertainties, and the actual costs incurred could be different than this adjustment. \n\nCompany Restaurant Depreciation and Amortization\nThe following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations for Bojangles', Inc. (\u201cBojangles'\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report. In this annual report, unless the context otherwise requires, references to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour\u201d mean the Company, together with its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis.\n \u2022 bankruptcy proceedings or other significant financial distress; \nIncome Taxes\nAdditionally, we review leases for which we are involved in construction to determine whether build-to-suit and sale-leaseback criteria are met. For those leases that trigger specific build-to-suit accounting, we are considered the accounting owner of the construction project and in such cases, developer's construction costs are capitalized, including the value of costs incurred up to the date we execute our lease and costs incurred during the remainder of the construction period, as such costs are incurred. During the construction period an offsetting liability is recognized as a financing lease obligation for the construction costs incurred by the developer. The construction period begins when we execute our lease agreement with the property owner and continues until the space is substantially complete and ready for its intended use.\nGeneral and administrative expenses include expenses associated with corporate and administrative functions that support our operations, including compensation and benefits, travel expense, stock-based compensation expense, legal and professional fees, training, and other corporate costs. We expect we will incur incremental increases in general and administrative expenses as a result of operating as a public company.\nWe lease restaurant land and buildings, certain restaurant, office and point-of-sale equipment, office space and vehicles under operating and capital leases. Accounting for leased properties requires compliance with technical accounting rules and significant judgment by management. Application of these accounting rules and assumptions made by management will determine whether we are considered the owner for accounting purposes or whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or as a capital lease.\nComparable restaurant sales reflects the change in year-over-year sales for the comparable restaurant base. A restaurant enters our comparable restaurant base the first full day of the month after being open for 15 months using a mid-month convention. While we do not record franchised sales as revenues, our royalty revenues are calculated based on a percentage of franchised restaurant sales.\nKey Financial Definitions\n Restaurant Openings\nInterest expense decreased $0.8 million during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The decrease was due primarily to principal payments of $28.1 million on our long-term debt and a reduction in our applicable rate, partially offset by an increase in capital lease obligations during fiscal 2015.\nFood and supplies costs include the direct costs associated with food, beverage and packaging of our menu items at company-operated restaurants. The components of food and supplies are variable in nature, change with sales volume, are affected by menu mix and are subject to fluctuations in commodity costs.\nWe expect our recurring general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we grow our business and incur additional expenses related to being a newer public company.\nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment, and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment, we first compare undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.\n (f) Represents the elimination of a gain from the termination of a contract with a beverage vendor. \nFood and Supplies Costs\nFood and supplies costs increased $17.4 million during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in company restaurant revenues and a $1.5 million gain associated with the termination of a beverage vendor contract during fiscal 2014, which was recorded as a reduction to food and supplies costs. Excluding the impact of the $1.5 million gain associated with the termination of a beverage vendor contract, food and supplies costs as a percentage of company restaurant revenues during fiscal 2014 was 33.1% versus 32.6% during fiscal 2015. This percentage decrease was primarily due to our menu price increases, partially offset by commodity price increases.\nRestaurant Depreciation and Amortization\nNet cash used in investing activities increased from $8.6 million for fiscal 2013 to $10.7 million for fiscal 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the assets of eight Bojangles' restaurants from a franchisee in April 2014 for the purchase price of approximately $3.8 million of which approximately $0.6 million was deferred, a reduction in proceeds from disposition of property and equipment of approximately $0.8 million, offset by a decrease in purchases of property and equipment of approximately $1.9 million.\n (1) Includes estimated interest payments calculated based on current interest rates as of December 27, 2015. Interest includes interest and fees under our credit facility and our interest rate swaps. \nSystem-wide Average Unit Volumes\nOperating Costs\nPro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this Form 10-K are supplemental measures of our performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Pro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. In addition, in evaluating Pro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses or charges such as those added back to calculate Pro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Pro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nResults of Operations\nWe record the stock-based awards on the fair value of the shares at the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures, less the amount that the employee is required to pay. In order to calculate our stock options' fair values and the associated compensation costs for share-based awards, we utilize the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, and we have developed estimates of various inputs including expected term, expected volatility and risk-free interest rate. These assumptions generally require significant judgment. The forfeiture rate is based on historical rates and reduces the compensation expense recognized. The expected term for options granted is derived using the \u201csimplified\u201d method, in accordance with SEC guidance. Expected volatility is estimated using publicly-traded peer companies in our market category. Volatility is calculated with reference to the historical daily closing equity prices of our peer companies, prior to the grant date, over a period equal to the expected term. We calculate the risk-free interest rate using the implied yield for a U.S. Treasury security with constant maturity and a remaining term equal to the expected term of our employee stock options. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero for option valuation purposes.\nEmerging Growth Company\nWe use interest-rate-related derivative instruments to manage our exposure related to changes in interest rates on our variable-rate debt instruments. We do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging. For all hedging relationships, we formally document the hedging relationship and risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the hedging instrument, the hedged transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, how the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively, and a description of the method used to measure ineffectiveness. We also formally assess, both at the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging relationships are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged transactions.\n (d) Includes expenses directly associated with the opening of company-operated restaurants and incurred prior to the opening of a company-operated restaurant. \nRestaurant labor costs, including preopening labor, consist of company-operated restaurant-level management and hourly labor costs, including salaries, wages, payroll taxes, workers' compensation expense, benefits and bonuses paid to our company-operated restaurant-level team members. Like other cost items, we expect restaurant labor costs at our company-operated restaurants to grow due to inflation and as our company restaurant revenues grows.
