This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ significantly from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those set forth in the sections entitled Risk Factors\u201d and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nBusiness Summary\nLazard is one of the world's preeminent financial advisory and asset management firms. We have long specialized in crafting solutions to the complex financial and strategic challenges of a diverse set of clients around the world, including corporations, governments, institutions, partnerships and individuals. Founded in 1848 in New Orleans, we currently operate from more than 40 cities and 25 countries across key business and financial centers in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and Central and South America.\nOur primary business purpose is to serve our clients. Our deep roots in business centers around the world form a global network of relationships with key decision-makers in corporations, governments and investing institutions. This network is both a competitive strength and a powerful resource for Lazard and our clients. As a firm that competes on the quality of our advice, we have two fundamental assets: our people and our reputation.\nWe operate in cyclical businesses across multiple geographies, industries and asset classes. In recent years, we have expanded our geographic reach, bolstered our industry expertise and continued to build in growth areas. Companies, government bodies and investors seek independent advice with a geographic perspective, deep understanding of capital structure, informed research and knowledge of global, regional and local economic conditions. We believe that our business model as an independent advisor will continue to create opportunities for us to attract new clients and key personnel.\nOur principal sources of revenue are derived from activities in the following business segments:\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Financial Advisory, which offers corporate, partnership, institutional, government, sovereign and individual clients across the globe a wide array of financial advisory services regarding mergers and acquisitions ( M&A\u201d), capital advisory, restructurings, shareholder advisory, sovereign advisory, capital raising and other strategic advisory matters, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Asset Management, which offers a broad range of global investment solutions and investment management services in equity and fixed income strategies, asset allocation strategies, alternative investments and private equity funds to corporations, public funds, sovereign entities, endowments and foundations, labor funds, financial intermediaries and private clients.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, we record selected other activities in our Corporate segment, including management of cash, investments, deferred tax assets, outstanding indebtedness, certain contingent obligations, and assets and liabilities associated with Lazard Group's Paris-based subsidiary, Lazard Fr\u00e8res Banque SA ( LFB\u201d).\nOur consolidated net revenue was derived from the following segments:\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financial Advisory\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset Management\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe also invest our own capital from time to time, generally alongside capital of qualified institutional and individual investors in alternative investments or private equity investments, and, since 2005, we have engaged in a number of alternative investments and private equity activities, including, historically, investments through (i)\nEdgewater, our Chicago-based private equity firm and (ii) a fund targeting significant noncontrolling-stake investments in established private companies. We also make investments to seed our Asset Management strategies.\nBusiness Environment and Outlook\nEconomic and global financial market conditions can materially affect our financial performance. As described above, our principal sources of revenue are derived from activities in our Financial Advisory and Asset Management business segments. As our Financial Advisory revenues are primarily dependent on the successful completion of merger, acquisition, restructuring, capital raising or similar transactions, and our Asset Management revenues are primarily driven by the levels of assets under management, weak economic and global financial market conditions can result in a challenging business environment for M&A and capital-raising activity as well as our Asset Management business, but may provide opportunities for our restructuring business.\nOn an ongoing basis, regional, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including trade policy and regional tax and regulatory reform, may impact our business. Overall, the global macroeconomic environment remains favorable, equity market fundamentals are strong and credit is widely available.\nOur outlook with respect to our Financial Advisory and Asset Management businesses is described below.\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Financial Advisory-The fundamentals for continued M&A activity and recent trends such as technological disruption and shareholder activism, which can be a catalyst for global strategic activity, appear to remain in place. We believe our Financial Advisory business is in a strong competitive position as demand continues for expert, independent strategic advice that can be levered across geographies and our range of capabilities. The global scale and breadth of our Financial Advisory business allows us to advise on a wide range of strategic and restructuring transactions across a variety of industries. In addition, we believe our businesses throughout North America, Europe and the emerging markets position us for growth in these markets, while enhancing our relationships with, and the services that we can provide to, clients in other economies. We continue to invest in our Financial Advisory business by selectively hiring talented senior professionals and continuing to focus on our M&A and other advisory services.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Asset Management-In the short to intermediate term, we expect most investor demand will come through financial institutions, and from defined benefit and defined contribution plans in developed economies because of their sheer scope and size. Over the longer term, and depending upon local market conditions, we would expect an increasing share of our AUM to come from the developing economies around the globe, as their retirement systems evolve and individual wealth is increasingly deployed in the financial markets. Given our diversified investment platform and our ability to provide investment solutions for a global mix of clients, we believe we are positioned to benefit from opportunities across the asset management industry. We are continually developing and seeding new investment strategies that extend our existing platforms and assessing potential product acquisitions or other inorganic growth opportunities. Recent examples of growth initiatives include the following investment strategies: various Quantitative Equity strategies, explainable AI capabilities, a U.S. Systematic Equity strategy, and sustainable investment strategies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge continuously, and it is not possible for our management to predict all risks and uncertainties, nor can we assess the impact of all potentially applicable factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. See Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K. Furthermore, net income and revenue in any period may not be indicative of full-year results or the results of any other period and may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter.\nOverall, we continue to focus on the development of our business, including the generation of stable revenue growth, earnings growth and shareholder returns, the evaluation of potential growth opportunities, the investment in new technology to support the development of existing and new business opportunities, the prudent management of our costs and expenses, the efficient use of our assets and the return of capital to our shareholders.\nCertain market data with respect to our Financial Advisory and Asset Management businesses is included below.\nFinancial Advisory\nAs reflected in the following table, which sets forth global M&A industry statistics, the value and number of all completed transactions, including the subset of completed transactions involving values greater than $500 million, decreased in 2019 as compared to 2018. With respect to announced M&A transactions, the value and number of all transactions, including the subset of announced transactions involving values greater than $500 million, are flat as compared to 2018, apart from the number of announced transactions involving values greater than $500 million, which decreased in 2019 as compared to 2018.\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nIncr / (Decr)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in billions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Completed M&A Transactions:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All deals:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deals Greater than $500 million:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Announced M&A Transactions:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All deals:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deals Greater than $500 million:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td> Source:\n</td> <td> Dealogic as of January 3, 2020.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGlobal restructuring activity during 2019, as measured by the number of corporate defaults, increased as compared to 2018. The number of defaulting issuers increased to 101 in 2019, according to Moody's Investors Service, Inc., as compared to 79 in 2018.\nNet revenue trends in Financial Advisory are generally correlated to the level of completed industry-wide M&A transactions and restructuring transactions occurring subsequent to corporate debt defaults, respectively. However, deviations from this relationship can occur in any given year for a number of reasons. For instance, our results can diverge from industry-wide activity where there are material variances from the level of industry-wide M&A activity in a particular market where Lazard has significant market share, or regarding the relative number of our advisory engagements with respect to larger-sized transactions, and where we are involved in non-public or sovereign advisory assignments.\nAsset Management\nEquity market indices for major markets at December 31, 2019 generally increased as compared to such indices at December 31, 2018. Equity market indices for major markets at December 31, 2018 generally decreased as compared to such indices at December 31, 2017.\nThe percentage change in major equity market indices (i) at December 31, 2019, as compared to such indices at December 31, 2018, and (ii) at December 31, 2018, as compared to such indices at December 31, 2017, is shown in the table below.\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage Changes\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 vs. 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MSCI World Index\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Euro Stoxx\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MSCI Emerging Market\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> S&P 500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe fees that we receive for providing investment management and advisory services are primarily driven by the level of AUM and the nature of the AUM product mix. Accordingly, market movements, foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changes in our AUM product mix will impact the level of revenues we receive from our Asset Management business when comparing periodic results. A substantial portion of our AUM is invested in equities. Movements in AUM during the period generally reflect the changes in equity market indices.\nFinancial Statement Overview\nNet Revenue\nThe majority of Lazard's Financial Advisory net revenue historically has been earned from the successful completion of M&A transactions, capital advisory services, capital raising, restructuring, shareholder advisory, sovereign advisory and other strategic advisory matters. The main drivers of Financial Advisory net revenue are overall M&A activity, the level of corporate debt defaults and the environment for capital raising activities, particularly in the industries and geographic markets in which Lazard focuses. In some client engagements, often those involving financially distressed companies, revenue is earned in the form of retainers and similar fees that are contractually agreed upon with each client for each assignment and are not necessarily linked to the completion of a transaction. In addition, Lazard also earns fees from providing strategic advice to clients, with such fees not being dependent on a specific transaction, and may also earn fees in connection with public and private securities offerings. Significant fluctuations in Financial Advisory net revenue can occur over the course of any given year, because a significant portion of such net revenue is earned upon the successful completion of a transaction, restructuring or capital raising activity, the timing of which is uncertain and is not subject to Lazard's control.\nLazard's Asset Management segment principally includes LAM, LFG and Edgewater. Asset Management net revenue is derived from fees for investment management and advisory services provided to clients. As noted above, the main driver of Asset Management net revenue is the level and product mix of AUM, which is generally influenced by the performance of the global equity markets and, to a lesser extent, fixed income markets as well as Lazard's investment performance, which impacts its ability to successfully attract and retain assets. As a result, fluctuations (including timing thereof) in financial markets and client asset inflows and outflows have a direct effect on Asset Management net revenue and operating income. Asset Management fees are generally based on the level of AUM measured daily, monthly or quarterly, and an increase or reduction in AUM, due to market price fluctuations, currency fluctuations, changes in product mix, or net client asset flows will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in management fees. The majority of our investment advisory contracts are generally terminable at any time or on notice of 30 days or less. Institutional and individual clients, and firms with which we have strategic alliances, can terminate their relationship with us, reduce the aggregate amount of AUM or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for a number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates and financial market performance. In addition, as Lazard's AUM includes significant amounts of assets that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. Dollars, changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies will impact the value of Lazard's AUM and the overall amount of management fees generated by the AUM. Fees vary with the type of assets managed and the vehicle in which they are managed, with higher fees earned on equity assets and alternative investment funds, such as hedge funds and private equity funds, and lower fees earned on fixed income and cash management products.\nThe Company earns performance-based incentive fees on various investment products, including traditional products and alternative investment funds, such as hedge funds and private equity funds.\nFor hedge funds, incentive fees are calculated based on a specified percentage of a fund's net appreciation, in some cases in excess of established benchmarks or thresholds. The Company records incentive fees on traditional products and hedge funds at the end of the relevant performance measurement period, when potential uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizable amounts have been determined. The incentive fee measurement period is generally an annual period (unless an account terminates or redemption occurs during the year). The incentive fees received at the end of the measurement period are not subject to reversal or payback. Incentive fees on hedge funds are often subject to loss carryforward provisions in which losses incurred by the hedge funds in any year are applied against certain gains realized by the hedge funds in future periods before any incentive fees can be earned.\nFor private equity funds, incentive fees may be earned in the form of a carried interest\u201d if profits arising from realized investments exceed a specified threshold. Typically, such carried interest is ultimately calculated on a whole-fund basis and, therefore, clawback of carried interest during the life of the fund can occur. As a result, incentive fees earned on our private equity funds are not recognized until potential uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizable amounts have been determined, including any potential for clawback.\nCorporate segment net revenue consists primarily of investment gains and losses on the Company's seed investments\u201d related to our Asset Management business and principal investments in private equity funds, net of hedging activities, as well as gains and losses on investments held in connection with Lazard Fund Interests ( LFI\u201d) and interest income and interest expense. Corporate net revenue also can fluctuate due to changes in the fair value of debt and equity securities, as well as due to changes in interest and currency exchange rates and in the levels of cash, investments and indebtedness.\nAlthough Corporate segment net revenue during 2019 is not significant compared to Lazard's net revenue, total assets in the Corporate segment represented 65% of Lazard's consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2019, which are attributable to cash and cash equivalents, investments in debt and equity securities, interests in alternative investment, debt, equity and private equity funds, deferred tax assets and certain assets associated with LFB.\nOperating Expenses\nThe majority of Lazard's operating expenses relate to compensation and benefits for managing directors and employees. Our compensation and benefits expense includes (i) salaries and benefits, (ii) amortization of the relevant portion of previously granted deferred incentive compensation awards, including (a) share-based incentive compensation under the Lazard Ltd 2018 Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2018 Plan\u201d) and the Lazard Ltd 2008 Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2008 Plan\u201d), and (b) LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements (see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), (iii) a provision for discretionary or guaranteed cash bonuses and profit pools and (iv) when applicable, severance payments. Compensation expense in any given period is dependent on many factors, including general economic and market conditions, our actual and forecasted operating and financial performance, staffing levels, estimated forfeiture rates, competitive pay conditions and the nature of revenues earned, as well as the mix between current and deferred compensation.\nWe believe that awarded compensation and benefits expense\u201d and the ratio of awarded compensation and benefits expense\u201d to operating revenue,\u201d both non-GAAP measures, are the most appropriate measures to assess the annual cost of compensation and provide the most meaningful basis for comparison of compensation and benefits expense between present, historical and future years. Awarded compensation and benefits expense\u201d for a given year is calculated using adjusted compensation and benefits expense,\u201d also a non-GAAP measure, as modified by the following items:\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> we deduct amortization expense recorded for accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) purposes in the fiscal year associated with deferred incentive compensation awards;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> we add incentive compensation with respect to the fiscal year, which is comprised of:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (i)\n</td> <td> the deferred incentive compensation awards granted in the year-end compensation process with respect to the fiscal year (e.g., deferred incentive compensation awards granted in 2020 related to the 2019 year-end compensation process), including performance-based restricted stock unit ( PRSU\u201d) and performance-based restricted participation unit ( PRPU\u201d) awards (based on the target payout level);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (ii)\n</td> <td> the portion of investments in people (e.g., sign-on\u201d bonuses or retention awards) and other special deferred incentive compensation awards that is applicable to the fiscal year the award becomes effective; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (iii)\n</td> <td> amounts in excess of the target payout level for PRSU and PRPU awards at the end of their respective performance periods; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> we reduce the amounts in (i), (ii) and (iii) above by an estimate of future forfeitures with respect to such awards.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe also use adjusted compensation and benefits expense\u201d and the ratio of adjusted compensation and benefits expense\u201d to operating revenue,\u201d both non-GAAP measures, for comparison of compensation and benefits expense between periods. For the reconciliations and calculations with respect to adjusted compensation and benefits expense\u201d and awarded compensation and benefits expense\u201d and related ratios to operating revenue,\u201d see the table under Consolidated Results of Operations\u201d below.\nCompensation and benefits expense is the largest component of our operating expenses. We seek to maintain discipline with respect to compensation, including the rate at which we award deferred compensation. Our goal is to maintain a ratio of awarded compensation and benefits expense to operating revenue and a ratio of adjusted compensation and benefits expense to operating revenue over the cycle in the mid- to high-50s percentage range. While we have implemented policies and initiatives that we believe will assist us in maintaining ratios within this range, there can be no guarantee that we will continue to maintain such ratios, or that our policies or initiatives will not change in the future. We may benefit from pressure on compensation costs within the financial services industry in future periods; however, increased competition for senior professionals, changes in the macroeconomic environment or the financial markets generally, lower operating revenue resulting from, for example, a decrease in M&A activity, our share of the M&A market or our AUM levels, changes in the mix of revenues from our businesses, investments in our businesses or various other factors could prevent us from achieving this goal.\nOur operating expenses also include non-compensation expense\u201d, which includes costs for occupancy and equipment, marketing and business development, technology and information services, professional services, fund administration and outsourced services and other expenses. Our occupancy costs represent a significant portion of our aggregate operating expenses and are subject to change from time to time, particularly as leases for real property expire and are renewed or replaced with new, long-term leases for the same or other real property.\nWe believe that adjusted non-compensation expense\u201d, a non-GAAP measure, provides a more meaningful basis for our investors to assess our operating results. For calculations with respect to adjusted non-compensation expense\u201d, see the table under Consolidated Results of Operations\u201d below.\nOur operating expenses also include our benefit pursuant to the tax receivable agreement\u201d (which, in 2017, was offset by the charges described below relating to the Tax Act) and amortization and other acquisition-related (benefits) costs\u201d, which includes the change in fair value of the contingent consideration associated with business acquisitions.\nBusiness Realignment\nWe conducted a review of our business, which resulted in a realignment that included employee reductions and the closing of subscale offices and investment strategies, most of which were completed during the third quarter of 2019. We believe these actions better align the business with changes in the marketplace and create greater flexibility to focus on strategic growth opportunities. These actions resulted in expenses of $68 million in 2019. See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nLazard Ltd, through its subsidiaries, is subject to U.S. federal income taxes on all of its U.S. operating income, as well as on the portion of non-U.S. income attributable to its U.S. subsidiaries. In addition, Lazard Ltd, through its subsidiaries, is subject to state and local taxes on its income apportioned to various state and local jurisdictions. Outside the U.S., Lazard Group operates principally through subsidiary corporations that are subject to local income taxes in foreign jurisdictions. Lazard Group is also subject to Unincorporated Business Tax ( UBT\u201d) attributable to its operations apportioned to New York City.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) was enacted. The Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax system by, among other changes, lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, implementing a partial territorial tax system and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on the deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Act also included several provisions that limited the benefit of the tax rate reduction, such as restricting the deductibility of interest expense and other corporate business expenses. The Tax Act further included anti-base erosion provisions such as the BEAT and tax on GILTI. The GILTI provisions impose a tax on certain income from foreign operations and we have elected to account for the tax on GILTI as a current period expense.\nSee Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Income Taxes\u201d below and Notes 19 and 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes, the impact of the Tax Act on us, our deferred tax assets and the tax receivable agreement obligation.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests primarily consist of amounts related to Edgewater's management vehicles that the Company is deemed to control but not own, profits interest participation rights and consolidated VIE interests held by employees. See Notes 15 and 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company's noncontrolling interests and consolidated VIEs.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nLazard's consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars. Many of our non-U.S. subsidiaries have a functional currency (i.e., the currency in which operational activities are primarily conducted) that is other than the U.S. Dollar, generally the currency of the country in which the subsidiaries are domiciled. Such subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars using exchange rates as of the respective balance sheet date, while revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the respective periods based on the daily closing exchange rates. Adjustments that result from translating amounts from a subsidiary's functional currency are reported as a component of stockholders' equity. Foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on transactions in non-functional currencies are included in the consolidated statements of operations.\nA portion of our net revenue is derived from transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was negatively impacted, and net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was positively impacted, by exchange rate movements, in each case in comparison to the relevant prior year period. The majority of the impact to net revenue, in both periods, was offset by the impact of the exchange rate movements on our operating expenses during the years denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Selected financial data derived from the Company's reported consolidated results of operations is set forth below, followed by a more detailed discussion of both the consolidated and business segment results.\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,586,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,826,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,644,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Expenses (a):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,563,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,514,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,512,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 611,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 653,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 499,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization and other acquisition-related (benefits) costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15,897\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Benefit pursuant to tax receivable agreement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (503\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,495\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (202,546\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,194,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,145,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,818,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 392,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 680,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 825,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 94,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 148,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 565,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 297,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 532,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 259,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less - Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income Attributable to Lazard Ltd\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 286,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 527,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 253,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Income, as a % of net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding business realignment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe tables below describe the components of operating revenue, adjusted and awarded compensation and benefits expense, adjusted non-compensation expense, earnings from operations and related key ratios, which are non-GAAP measures used by the Company to manage its business.

operating results for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2018 appears below. A detailed review of our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 under the caption Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Operating Results\u201d.\nOperating Results\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 versus December 31, 2018\nThe Company reported net income attributable to Lazard Ltd of $287 million, as compared to net income attributable to Lazard Ltd of $527 million in 2018.\nNet revenue decreased $240 million, or 8%, with operating revenue decreasing $209 million, or 8%, as compared to 2018. Fee revenue from investment banking and other advisory activities decreased $183 million, or 12%, as compared to 2018. Asset management fees, including incentive fees, decreased $88 million, or 7%, as compared to 2018. In the aggregate, interest income, other revenue and interest expense increased $31 million as compared to 2018.\nCompensation and benefits expense, which included $57 million associated with business realignment in 2019, increased $49 million, or 3%, as compared to 2018.\nAdjusted compensation and benefits expense was $1,464 million, a decrease of $53 million, or 3%, as compared to $1,517 million in 2018. The ratio of adjusted compensation and benefits expense to operating revenue was 57.5% for 2019, as compared to 55.1% for 2018. Awarded compensation and benefits expense in 2019 was $1,469 million, a decrease of $68 million, or 4%, when compared to $1,537 million in 2018. The ratio of awarded compensation and benefits expense to operating revenue was 57.7%, as compared to 55.8% for 2018. The year-end deferred incentive compensation awarded for 2019 was $361 million, representing a decrease of $17 million, or 4%, as compared to 2018. As described above, when analyzing compensation and benefits expense on a full-year basis, we believe that awarded compensation and benefits expense provides the most meaningful basis for comparison of compensation and benefits expense between present, historical and future years.\nNon-compensation expense decreased $41 million, or 6%, as compared to 2018, primarily due to higher bad debt expense in 2018 and lower fund administration fees in 2019, partially offset by investments in technology infrastructure and increased business development expenses in 2019. Adjusted non-compensation expense increased $14 million, or 3%, as compared to 2018, primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure and increased\nbusiness development expenses in 2019. The ratio of adjusted non-compensation expense to operating revenue was 19.6% for 2019, as compared to 17.6% in 2018.\nAmortization and other acquisition-related (benefits) costs reflect a cost of $19 million in the 2019 period, as compared to a benefit of $16 million in the 2018 period, primarily due to the change in the fair market value of contingent consideration.\nOperating income decreased $288 million, or 42%, as compared to 2018.\nEarnings from operations decreased $171 million, or 23%, as compared to 2018, and, as a percentage of operating revenue, was 22.9%, as compared to 27.4% in 2018.\nThe provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of 24.2%, as compared to 21.8% in 2018. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Critical Accounting Policies-Income Taxes\u201d below.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $6 million as compared to 2018.\nBusiness Segments\nThe following is a discussion of net revenue and operating income for the Company's segments: Financial Advisory, Asset Management and Corporate. Each segment's operating expenses include (i) compensation and benefits expenses that are incurred directly in support of the segment and (ii) other operating expenses, which include directly incurred expenses for occupancy and equipment, marketing and business development, technology and information services, professional services, fund administration and outsourcing, and indirect support costs (including compensation and benefits expense and other operating expenses related thereto) for administrative services. Such administrative services include, but are not limited to, accounting, tax, human resources, legal, information technology, facilities management and senior management activities. Such support costs are allocated to the relevant segments based on various statistical drivers such as revenue, headcount, square footage and other factors.\nFinancial Advisory\nThe following table

professionals have significant experience, and many of them are able to use this experience to advise on M&A, restructuring and other strategic advisory matters, depending on clients' needs. This flexibility allows Lazard to better match its professionals with the counter-cyclical business cycles of mergers and acquisitions and restructurings. While Lazard measures revenue by practice area, Lazard does not separately measure the costs or profitability of M&A services as compared to restructuring or other services. Accordingly, Lazard measures performance in its Financial Advisory segment based on overall segment operating revenue and operating income margins.\nFinancial Advisory Results of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 versus December 31, 2018\nFinancial Advisory net revenue decreased $181 million, or 12%, as compared to 2018. The decrease in Financial Advisory net revenue was primarily a result of a decrease in the number of fees greater than $5 million as compared to 2018.\nOperating expenses, which included $40 million associated with business realignment in 2019, increased $27 million, or 2%, as compared to 2018.\nFinancial Advisory operating income was $148 million, a decrease of $208 million, or 58%, as compared to operating income of $357 million in 2018 and, as a percentage of net revenue, was 10.8%, as compared to 22.9% in 2018.\nAsset Management\nThe following table shows the composition of AUM for the Asset Management segment (see Item 1, Business-Principal Business Lines-Asset Management-Investment Strategies\u201d):\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AUM by Asset Class:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Emerging Markets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Global\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Local\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Multi-Regional\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 205,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 176,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 209,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed Income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Emerging Markets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Global\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Local\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Multi-Regional\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Fixed Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Alternative Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Private Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash Management\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total AUM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 248,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 214,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 249,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal AUM at December 31, 2019 was $248 billion, an increase of $33 billion, or 16%, as compared to total AUM of $215 billion at December 31, 2018, due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows and foreign exchange depreciation. Average AUM for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $7 billion, or 3%, as compared to 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2019 approximately 86% of our AUM was managed on behalf of institutional clients, including corporations, labor unions, public pension funds, insurance companies and banks, and through sub-advisory relationships, mutual fund sponsors, broker-dealers and registered advisors as compared to approximately 88% as of December 31, 2018.

Management fees and other revenue was $1,216 million, a decrease of $95 million, or 7%, as compared to $1,311 million in 2018, primarily due to a decrease in average AUM and change in asset mix. Incentive fees were unchanged as compared to 2018.\nOperating expenses, which included $16 million associated with business realignment in 2019, decreased $25 million, or 3%, as compared to 2018, primarily due to a decrease in compensation and benefits expense associated with decreased operating revenue as well as lower fund administration fees.\nAsset Management operating income was $350 million, a decrease of $70 million, or 17%, as compared to operating income of $420 million in 2018 and, as a percentage of net revenue, was 28.3%, as compared to 31.5% in 2018.\nCorporate\nThe following table summarizes the reported operating results attributable to the Corporate segment:\nTable 167: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (75,593\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (55,021\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (51,452\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Interest (Expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (63,563\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (43,869\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (45,914\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Revenue (Expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17,106\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Revenue (Expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24,653\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (60,975\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Expenses (Benefit) (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 80,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (135,591\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Income (Loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (105,411\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (95,644\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 136,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> Includes in 2019, 2018 and 2017, benefits of $503, $6,495 and $202,546, respectively, pursuant to the tax receivable agreement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCorporate Results of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 versus December 31, 2018\nNet interest expense increased $20 million, or 45%, as compared to 2018 due to an increase in senior debt outstanding in 2019.\nOther revenue increased $56 million as compared to 2018, primarily due to higher income in 2019 attributable to investments held in connection with LFI.\nOperating expenses, which included (i) in 2019, $8 million associated with business realignment and (ii) in 2018, $10 million relating to expenses associated with an unconditional commitment to the Lazard Foundation, increased $46 million in 2019, primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense, which reflected an increase in charges pertaining to LFI.\nCash Flows\nThe Company's cash flows are influenced primarily by the timing of the receipt of Financial Advisory and Asset Management fees, the timing of distributions to shareholders, payments of incentive compensation to managing directors and employees and purchases of Class A common stock. Cash flows were also affected: (i) in 2019, by Lazard Group's issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.375% senior notes maturing in 2029 (the 2029 Notes\u201d); (ii) in 2018, by Lazard Group's issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.50% senior notes maturing in 2028 (the 2028 Notes\u201d) and (iii) in 2019 and 2018, the redemption of the 2020 Notes.\nM&A and other advisory and Asset Management fees are generally collected within 60 days of billing, while Restructuring fee collections may extend beyond 60 days, particularly those that involve bankruptcies with court-ordered holdbacks. Fees from our Private Capital Advisory activities are generally collected over a four-year period from billing and typically include an interest component.\nThe Company makes cash payments for, or in respect of, a significant portion of its incentive compensation during the first three months of each calendar year with respect to the prior year's results. The Company also paid a special dividend in 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nSummary of Cash Flows:\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr>

are derived from operating activities, financing activities and equity offerings.\nOperating Activities\nNet revenue, operating income and cash receipts fluctuate significantly between periods. In the case of Financial Advisory, fee receipts are generally dependent upon the successful completion of client transactions, the occurrence and timing of which is irregular and not subject to Lazard's control.\nLiquidity is significantly impacted by cash payments for, or in respect of, incentive compensation, a significant portion of which are made during the first three months of the year. As a consequence, cash on hand generally declines in the beginning of the year and gradually builds over the remainder of the year. We also pay certain tax advances during the year on behalf of certain managing directors, which serve to reduce their respective incentive compensation payments. We expect this seasonal pattern of cash flow to continue.\nLiquidity is also affected by the level of deposits and other customer payables, principally at LFB. To the extent that such deposits and other customer payables rise or fall, this has a corresponding impact on liquidity held at LFB, with the majority of such amounts generally being recorded in deposits with banks and short-term investments\u201d. In the year ended December 31, 2019, as reflected on the consolidated statements of financial condition, both deposits with banks and short-term investments\u201d and deposits and other customer payables\u201d increased as compared to December 31, 2018, due to a higher level of LFB customer-related demand deposits, primarily from clients and funds managed by LFG.\nLazard's consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars. Many of Lazard's non-U.S. subsidiaries have a functional currency (i.e., the currency in which operational activities are primarily conducted) that is other than the U.S. Dollar, generally the currency of the country in which such subsidiaries are domiciled. Such subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at the respective balance sheet date exchange rates, while revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year based on the daily closing exchange rates. Adjustments that result from translating amounts from a subsidiary's functional currency are reported as a component of stockholders' equity. Foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on transactions in non-functional currencies are included on the consolidated statements of operations.\nWe regularly monitor our liquidity position, including cash levels, investments in U.S. Treasury securities, credit lines, principal investment commitments, interest and principal payments on debt, capital expenditures, dividend payments, purchases of shares of Class A common stock and matters relating to liquidity and to compliance with regulatory net capital requirements. At December 31, 2019, Lazard had approximately $1,232 million of cash, with such amount including approximately $612 million held at Lazard's operations outside the U.S. Lazard provides for income taxes on substantially all of its foreign earnings. We expect that no material amount of additional taxes would be recognized upon receipt of dividends or distributions of such earnings from our foreign operations.\nWe maintain lines of credit in excess of anticipated liquidity requirements. As of December 31, 2019, Lazard had approximately $168 million in unused lines of credit available to it, including a $150 million, five-year, senior revolving credit facility with a group of lenders that expires in September 2020 (the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\u201d) (see -Financing Activities\u201d below) and unused lines of credit available to LFB of approximately $17 million.\nThe Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains customary terms and conditions, including limitations on consolidations, mergers, indebtedness and certain payments, as well as financial condition covenants relating to leverage and interest coverage ratios. Lazard Group's obligations under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement may be accelerated upon customary events of default, including non-payment of principal or interest, breaches of covenants, cross-defaults to other material debt, a change in control and specified bankruptcy events.\nFinancing Activities\nThe table below sets forth our corporate indebtedness as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Lazard Group used a portion of the net proceeds of the 2029 Notes to redeem or otherwise retire the remaining 2020 Notes in transactions that occurred during March 2019 and April 2019.\nDuring September 2018, Lazard Group completed an offering of the 2028 Notes. Lazard Group used a portion of the net proceeds of the 2028 Notes to redeem or otherwise retire $250 million of the 2020 Notes.\nLazard's annual cash flow generated from operations historically has been sufficient to enable it to meet its annual obligations. We believe that our cash flows from operating activities, along with the use of our credit lines as needed, should be sufficient for us to fund our current obligations for the next 12 months.\nAs long as the lenders' commitments remain in effect, any loan pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement remains outstanding and unpaid or any other amount is due to the lending bank group, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement includes financial covenants that require that Lazard Group not permit (i) its Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) for the 12-month period ending on the last day of any fiscal quarter to be greater than 3.25 to 1.00 or (ii) its Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) for the 12-month period ending on the last day of any fiscal quarter to be less than 3.00 to 1.00. For the 12-month period ended December 31, 2019, Lazard Group was in compliance with such ratios, with its Consolidated Leverage Ratio being 1.84 to 1.00 and its Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio being 12.82 to 1.00. In any event, no amounts were outstanding under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2019.\nIn addition, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, indenture and supplemental indentures relating to Lazard Group's senior notes contain certain other covenants (none of which relate to financial condition), events of default and other customary provisions. At December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all of these provisions. We may, to the extent required and subject to restrictions contained in our financing arrangements, use other financing sources, which may cause us to be subject to additional restrictions or covenants.\nSee Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding senior debt.\nStockholders' Equity\nAt December 31, 2019, total stockholders' equity was $682 million, as compared to $970 million and $1,259 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, including $610 million, $917 million and $1,200 million attributable to Lazard Ltd on the respective dates.

During a given year the Company intends to repurchase at least as many shares as it expects to ultimately issue pursuant to such compensation plans in respect of year-end incentive compensation attributable to the prior year. The rate at which the Company purchases shares in connection with this annual objective may vary from period to period due to a variety of factors. Purchases with respect to such program are set forth in the table below:\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td> Year Ended December 31:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Number of\nShares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average\nPrice Per\nShare\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,956,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 44.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,206,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,674,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2019, a total of $401 million of share repurchase authorization remained available under the Company's share repurchase program, $101 million of which will expire on December 31, 2020 and $300 million of which will expire on December 31, 2021.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company had in place trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, pursuant to which it effected stock repurchases in the open market.\nOn October 31, 2019, Lazard Group distributed to its managing members, which are subsidiaries of Lazard Ltd, 17,000,000 shares of Class A common stock that were held by Lazard Group. These shares were ultimately received by Lazard Ltd and cancelled. There was no impact on total stockholders' equity as a result of the share cancellation.\nOn January 29, 2020, the Board of Directors of Lazard declared a quarterly dividend of $0.47 per share on our Class A common stock. The dividend is payable on February 28, 2020, to stockholders of record on February 18, 2020.\nThe Company plans to continue to deploy excess cash and may do so in a variety of ways, which may include repurchasing outstanding shares of Class A common stock, paying dividends to stockholders and repurchasing its outstanding debt.\nSee Notes 15 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Lazard's stockholders' equity and incentive plans, respectively.\nRegulatory Capital\nWe actively monitor our regulatory capital base. Our principal subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements in their respective jurisdictions to ensure their general financial soundness and liquidity, which require, among other things, that we comply with rules regarding certain minimum capital requirements, record-keeping, reporting procedures, relationships with customers, experience and training requirements for employees and certain other requirements and procedures. These regulatory requirements may restrict the flow of funds to and from affiliates. See Note 22 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. These regulations differ in the U.S., the U.K., France and other countries in which we operate. Our capital structure is designed to provide each of our subsidiaries with capital and liquidity consistent with its business and regulatory requirements. For a discussion of regulations relating to us, see Item 1, Business-Regulation\u201d included in this Form 10-K.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth information relating to Lazard's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Contractual Obligations Payment Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior debt (including interest) (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,273,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 70,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 140,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 140,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,922,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases (exclusive of $19,584 of\ncommitted sublease income)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 794,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 89,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 152,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 124,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 428,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment capital funding commitments (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,073,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 165,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 292,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 264,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,350,826\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> During March 2019, Lazard Group completed an offering of $500,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes.

See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Income Taxes\u201d below. See also Notes 14, 16, 17, 19 and 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding information in connection with commitments, incentive plans, employee benefit plans, income taxes and tax receivable agreement obligations, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEffect of Inflation\nWe do not believe inflation will significantly affect our compensation costs as they are substantially variable in nature. However, the rate of inflation may affect certain of our other expenses, such as information technology and occupancy costs. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other effects upon the securities markets or general macroeconomic conditions, it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations by impacting overall levels of M&A activity, reducing our AUM or net revenue, or otherwise. See Item 1A, Risk Factors-Other Business Risks-Difficult market conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the volume of the transactions involving our Financial Advisory business and reducing the value or performance of the assets we manage in our Asset Management business, which, in each case, could materially reduce our revenue or income and adversely affect our financial position\u201d.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of Lazard's consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, Lazard evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, income taxes (including the impact on the tax receivable agreement obligation), investing activities and goodwill. Lazard bases these estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments, including judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities, that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nLazard believes that the critical accounting policies set forth below comprise the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nLazard generates substantially all of its net revenue from providing Financial Advisory and Asset Management services to clients. Lazard recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met:\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a contract with a client has been identified;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the performance obligations in the contract have been identified;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the fee or other transaction price has been determined;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the fee or other transaction price has been allocated to each performance obligation in the contract; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the Company has satisfied the applicable performance obligation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company earns performance-based incentive fees on various investment products, including traditional products and alternative investment funds such as hedge funds and private equity funds. See Financial Statement Overview\u201d for a description of our revenue recognition policies on such fees.\nIf, in Lazard's judgment, collection of a fee is not probable, Lazard will not recognize revenue until the uncertainty is removed. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide coverage for estimated losses from our receivables. We determine the adequacy of the allowance by estimating the probability of loss based on our analysis of the client's creditworthiness and specifically reserve against exposures where we determine the receivables are impaired, which may include situations where a fee is in dispute or litigation has commenced.\nWith respect to fees receivable from Financial Advisory activities, such receivables are generally deemed past due when they are outstanding 60 days from the date of invoice. However, some Financial Advisory transactions include specific contractual payment terms that may vary from one month to four years (as is the case for our Private Capital Advisory fees) following the invoice date or may be subject to court approval (as is the case with restructuring assignments that include bankruptcy proceedings). In such cases, receivables are deemed past due\nwhen payment is not received by the agreed-upon contractual date or the court approval date, respectively. Financial Advisory fee receivables past due in excess of 180 days are fully provided for unless there is evidence that the balance is collectible. Asset Management fees are deemed past due and fully provided for when such receivables are outstanding 12 months after the invoice date. Notwithstanding our policy for receivables past due, we specifically reserve against exposures relating to Financial Advisory and Asset Management fees where we determine receivables are impaired.\nIncome Taxes\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income taxes for each of our tax-paying entities in its respective jurisdiction. In addition to estimating actual current tax liabilities for these jurisdictions, we also must account for the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting of items, such as basis adjustments, compensation and benefits expense, and depreciation and amortization. Differences which are temporary in nature result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets and our unrecognized tax benefits.\nWe recognize a deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of greater than 50%) that a tax benefit will be accepted by a taxing authority. The measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based upon currently enacted tax rates in the applicable jurisdictions. At December 31, 2019, on a consolidated basis, we recorded gross deferred tax assets of approximately $737 million, with such amount partially offset by a valuation allowance of approximately $76 million (as described below).\nSubsequent to the initial recognition of deferred tax assets, we also must continually assess the likelihood that such deferred tax assets will be realized. If we determine that we may not fully derive the benefit from a deferred tax asset, we consider whether it would be appropriate to apply a valuation allowance against the applicable deferred tax asset, taking into account all available information. The ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset for a particular entity depends, among other things, on the generation of taxable income by such entity in the applicable jurisdiction.\nWe consider multiple possible sources of taxable income when assessing a valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset, including:\nTable 188: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> taxable income in prior carryback years; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> tax-planning strategies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted also considers all available information, including the following:\nTable 192: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> nature, frequency, magnitude and duration of any past losses and current operating results;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> duration of statutory carryforward periods;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> historical experience with tax attributes expiring unused; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> near-term and medium-term financial outlook.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe weight we give to any particular item is, in part, dependent upon the degree to which it can be objectively verified. We give greater weight to the recent results of operations of a relevant entity. Pre-tax operating losses on a three year cumulative basis or lack of sustainable profitability are considered objectively verifiable evidence and will generally outweigh a projection of future taxable income.\nCertain of our tax-paying entities have individually experienced losses on a cumulative three year basis or have tax attributes that may expire unused. In addition, one of our tax-paying entities has recorded a valuation allowance on substantially all of its deferred tax assets due to the combined effect of operating losses in certain subsidiaries of that entity as well as foreign taxes that together substantially offset any U.S. tax liability. Taking into\naccount all available information, we cannot determine that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets held by these entities will be realized. Consequently, we have recorded valuation allowances on $76 million of deferred tax assets held by these entities as of December 31, 2019.\nWe record tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return based upon our estimates regarding the amount that is more likely than not to be realized or paid, including in connection with the resolution of any related appeals or other legal processes. Accordingly, we recognize liabilities for certain unrecognized tax benefits based on the amounts that are more likely than not to be settled with the relevant taxing authority. Such liabilities are evaluated periodically as new information becomes available and any changes in the amounts of such liabilities are recorded as adjustments to income tax expense.\u201d Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits involve significant judgment and the ultimate resolution of such matters may be materially different from our estimates.\nOn January 1, 2017, we adopted new accounting guidance on share-based incentive compensation. As a result of the adoption of this new guidance, we recognized excess tax benefits of $11 million, $33 million and $9 million from the vesting of share-based incentive compensation in the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Upon adoption of the new guidance, we also recorded deferred tax assets of $82 million, net of a valuation allowance of $12 million, for previously unrecognized excess tax benefits (including tax benefits from dividends or dividend equivalents) on share-based incentive compensation, with an offsetting adjustment to retained earnings. The new guidance has since January 1, 2017 affected, and the Company expects that in future periods the new guidance will affect, the provision for income taxes for the delivery of stock under share-based incentive compensation arrangements, as well as the effective tax rate in the relevant periods, which could be material to the consolidated statements of operations and the classification of cash flows in the relevant periods.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted. The Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax system by, among other changes, lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, implementing a partial territorial tax system and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on the deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Act also included several provisions that limited the benefit of the tax rate reduction, such as restricting the deductibility of interest expense and other corporate business expenses. The Tax Act further included anti-base erosion provisions such as the BEAT and tax on GILTI and in 2019, the IRS issued broad and complex final and proposed regulations interpreting such provisions of the Tax Act.\nLazard is a holding company that is treated as a publicly traded partnership for U.S. tax purposes, and our U.S. and certain foreign subsidiaries were impacted by the Tax Act. See Notes 19 and 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the impact of the Tax Act on us.\nIn addition to the discussion above regarding deferred tax assets and associated valuation allowances, as well as unrecognized tax benefit liability estimates, other factors affect our provision for income taxes, including changes in the geographic mix of our business, the level of our annual pre-tax income, transfer pricing and intercompany transactions.\nSee Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d and Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to income taxes.\nAmended and Restated Tax Receivable Agreement\nDuring the period ended June 30, 2015, we released substantially all of our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. As a result, we accrued a corresponding liability during the period ended June 30, 2015 for amounts relating to the Second Amended and Restated Tax Receivable Agreement, dated as of October 26, 2015 (the Amended and Restated Tax Receivable Agreement\u201d), between Lazard and LTBP Trust (the Trust\u201d). See Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Amended and Restated Tax Receivable Agreement.\nThe amount of the Amended and Restated Tax Receivable Agreement liability is an undiscounted amount based upon currently enacted tax laws, including the Tax Act, the current structure of the Company and various\nassumptions regarding potential future operating profitability. The assumptions reflected in the estimate involve significant judgment, and if our structure were to change or our annual taxable income were to increase, we could be required to accelerate payments under the Amended and Restated Tax Receivable Agreement. As such, the actual amount and timing of payments under the Amended and Restated Tax Receivable Agreement could differ materially from our estimates. Any changes in the amount of the estimated liability would be recorded as a non-compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations. Adjustments, if necessary, to the related deferred tax assets would be recorded through income tax expense.\nThe cumulative liability relating to our obligations under the Amended and Restated Tax Receivable Agreement recorded as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $247 million and $271 million, respectively, and is recorded in tax receivable agreement obligation\u201d on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\nInvestments\nInvestments consist primarily of interest-bearing deposits, debt and equity securities, and interests in alternative investment, debt, equity and private equity funds.\nThese investments, with the exception of interest-bearing deposits, are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition, and any increases or decreases in the fair value of these investments are reflected in earnings. The fair value of investments is generally based upon market prices or the net asset value ( NAV\u201d) or its equivalent for investments in funds. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the measurement of the fair value of investments.\nLazard is subject to market and credit risk on investments held. As such, gains and losses on investment positions held, which arise from sales or changes in the fair value of the investments, are not predictable and can cause periodic fluctuations in net income.\nData relating to investments is set forth below:\nTable 196: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Seed investments by asset class:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equities (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 93,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 73,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Alternative investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total seed investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 113,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 90,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other investments owned:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Private equity (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest-bearing deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed income and other (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 124,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 226,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other investments owned\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 148,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 268,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subtotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 262,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 358,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Private equity consolidated, not owned (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> LFI (e)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 259,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 201,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 531,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 575,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> At December 31, 2019 and 2018, seed investments in directly owned equity securities were invested as follows:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage invested in:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financials\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Technology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 199: <table> <tr> <td> (b)\n</td> <td> Private equity investments include investments related to certain legacy businesses and co-investments in private equity funds managed by our Asset Management business.

See -Risk Management-Risks Related to Derivatives\u201d for risk management information relating to derivatives. LFI investments held in entities in which the Company maintained a controlling interest were $93 million in eight entities as of December 31, 2019, as compared to $69 million in three entities as of December 31, 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, total investments with a fair value of $531 million and $575 million, respectively, included $34 million and $57 million, respectively, or 6% and 10%, respectively, of investments that were classified using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient. See Notes 6 and 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding investments measured at fair value, including the levels of fair value within which such measurements of fair value fall.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company held seed investments of approximately $113 million and $90 million, respectively. Seed investments held in entities in which the Company maintained a controlling interest were $47 million in seven entities as of December 31, 2019, as compared to $31 million in eight entities as of December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company did not consolidate or deconsolidate any seed investment entities or LFI investment entities, with the exception of the recent consolidation of certain LFI funds (see Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). As such, 100% of the recorded balance of seed investments and substantially all of LFI investments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 represented the Company's economic interest in the seed and LFI investments. See -Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities\u201d below for more information on the Company's policy regarding the consolidation of seed and LFI investment entities.\nFor additional information regarding risks associated with our investments, see Risk Management-Investments\u201d below as well as Item 1A, Risk Factors-Other Business Risks-Our results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the fair value of positions held in our investment portfolios\u201d.\nAssets Under Management\nAUM primarily consists of debt and equity instruments, which have a value that is readily available based on either prices quoted on a recognized exchange or prices provided by external pricing services.\nPrices of equity and debt securities and other instruments that comprise our AUM are provided by well-recognized, independent, third-party vendors. Such third-party vendors rely on prices provided by external pricing services which are obtained from recognized exchanges or markets, or, for certain fixed income securities, from an evaluated bid or other similarly sourced price.\nEither directly, or through our third-party vendors, we perform a variety of regular due diligence procedures on our pricing service providers. Those procedures include oversight by our internal operations group, review of the pricing service providers' internal control frameworks, review of the pricing service providers' valuation methodologies, reconciliation to client custodial account values and comparison of significant pricing differences.\nGoodwill\nIn accordance with current accounting guidance, goodwill has an indefinite life and is tested for impairment annually, as of November 1, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The Company performs a qualitative evaluation about whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount in lieu of actually calculating the fair value of the reporting unit. The goodwill impairment test as of November 1, 2019 indicated that no reporting units were at risk of impairment. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding goodwill.\nConsolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Lazard Group and entities in which it has a controlling interest. Lazard determines whether it has a controlling interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity ( VOE\u201d) or a variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d) under U.S. GAAP.\nTable 203: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Voting Interest Entities. VOEs are entities in which (i) the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance itself independently and (ii) the equity holders have the obligation to absorb losses, the right to receive residual returns and the right to make decisions about the entity's activities. Lazard is required to consolidate a VOE if it holds a majority of the voting interest in such VOE.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Variable Interest Entities. VIEs are entities that lack one or more of the characteristics of a VOE. If Lazard has a variable interest, or a combination of variable interests, in a VIE, it is required to analyze whether it needs to consolidate such VIE. Lazard is required to consolidate a VIE if we are the primary beneficiary having (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of, or receive benefits from, the VIE that could be potentially significant to the VIE.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLazard's involvement with various entities that are VOEs or VIEs primarily arises from LFI investments and investment management contracts with fund entities in our Asset Management business. Lazard is not required to consolidate such entities because, with the exception of certain seed and LFI investments, as discussed below, we do not hold more than an inconsequential equity interest in such entities and we do not hold other variable interests (including our investment management agreements, which do not meet the definition of variable interests) in such entities.\nLazard makes seed and LFI investments in certain entities that are considered VOEs and VIEs and often require consolidation as a result of our investment. The impact of seed and LFI investment entities that require consolidation on the consolidated financial statements, including any consolidation or deconsolidation of such entities, is not material to our financial statements. Our exposure to loss from entities in which we have made such investments is limited to the extent of our investment in, or investment commitment to, such entities. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Investments\u201d above for more information regarding our investments.\nGenerally, when the Company initially invests to seed an investment entity, the Company is the majority owner of the entity. Our majority ownership in seed investment entities represents a controlling interest, except when we are the general partner in such entities and the third-party investors have the right to replace the general partner. To the extent material, we consolidate seed and LFI investment entities in which we own a controlling interest, and we would deconsolidate any such entity when we no longer have a controlling interest in such entity.\nRisk Management\nInvestments\nThe Company has investments in a variety of asset classes, primarily debt and equity securities, and interests in alternative investments, debt, equity and private equity funds. The Company makes investments primarily to seed strategies in our Asset Management business or to reduce exposure arising from LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements. The Company measures its net economic exposure to market and other risks arising from investments that it owns, excluding (i) investments held in connection with LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements, (ii) investments in funds owned entirely by the noncontrolling interest holders of certain acquired entities and (iii) interest-bearing deposits with maturities over 90 days that allow daily withdrawals without principal penalties.\nRisk sensitivities include the effects of economic hedging. For equity market price risk, investment portfolios and their corresponding hedges are beta-adjusted to the All-Country World equity index. Fair value and sensitivity measurements presented herein are based on various portfolio exposures at a particular point in time and may not be representative of future results. Risk exposures may change as a result of ongoing portfolio activities and changing market conditions, among other things.\nEquity Market Price Risk-At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company's exposure to equity market price risk in its investment portfolio, which primarily relates to investments in equity securities, equity funds and hedge funds, was approximately $85 million and $84 million, respectively. The Company hedges market exposure arising from a significant portion of our equity investment portfolios by entering into total return swaps. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a net decrease of approximately $1.0 million and $0.8 million in the carrying value of such investments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, including the effect of the hedging transactions.\nInterest Rate/Credit Spread Risk-At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company's exposure to interest rate and credit spread risk in its investment portfolio related to investments in debt securities or funds which invest primarily in debt securities was $153 million and $245 million, respectively. The Company hedges market exposure arising from a portion of our debt investment portfolios by entering into total return swaps. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse change in interest rates or credit spreads would result in a decrease of approximately $1.0 million and $0.9 million in the carrying value of such investments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, including the effect of the hedging transactions.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk-At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company's exposure to foreign exchange rate risk in its investment portfolio, which primarily relates to investments in foreign currency denominated equity and debt securities, was $37 million and $41 million, respectively. A significant portion of the Company's foreign currency exposure related to our equity and debt investment portfolios is hedged through the aforementioned total return swaps. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar would result in a decrease of approximately $0.2 million and $0.1 million in the carrying value of such investments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, including the effect of the hedging transactions.\nPrivate Equity-The Company invests in private equity primarily as a part of its co-investment activities and in connection with certain legacy businesses. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company's exposure to changes in fair value of such investments was approximately $24 million and $42 million, respectively. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in fair value would result in a decrease of approximately $2.4 million and $4.2 million in the carrying value of such investments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nRisks Related to Receivables\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide coverage for probable losses from our receivables. We determine the adequacy of the allowance by estimating the probability of loss based on our analysis of the client's creditworthiness, among other things, and specifically provide for exposures where we determine the receivables are impaired. At December 31, 2019, total receivables amounted to $663 million, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $27 million. As of that date, Financial Advisory and Asset Management fees, and customers and other receivables comprised 81% and 19% of total receivables, respectively. At December 31, 2018, total receivables amounted to $686 million, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $40 million. As of that date, Financial Advisory and Asset Management fees, and customers and other receivables comprised 73% and 27% of total receivables, respectively. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had receivables past due or deemed uncollectible of approximately $43 million and $42 million, respectively. See also Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Revenue Recognition\u201d above and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding receivables.\nLFB engages in lending activities, including commitments to extend credit (primarily for clients of LFG). At December 31, 2019 and 2018, customer receivables included $76 million and $64 million, respectively, of LFB loans, with such loans being fully collateralized and closely monitored for counterparty creditworthiness.\nCredit Concentrations\nTo reduce the exposure to concentrations of credit, the Company monitors large exposures to individual counterparties.\nRisks Related to Derivatives\nLazard enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge exposures to currency exchange rates and interest rates and uses total return swap contracts on various equity and debt indices to hedge a portion of its market exposure with respect to certain seed investments related to our Asset Management business. Derivative contracts are recorded at fair value. Derivative assets amounted to $1 million and $12 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and derivative liabilities, excluding the derivative liability arising from the Company's obligation pertaining to LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements, amounted to $10 million and $1 million at such respective dates.\nThe Company also records derivative liabilities relating to its obligations pertaining to LFI awards and other similar deferred compensation arrangements, the fair value of which is based on the value of the underlying investments, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. Changes in the fair value of the derivative liabilities are equally offset by the changes in the fair value of investments which are expected to be delivered upon settlement of LFI awards. Derivative liabilities relating to LFI amounted to $226 million and $188 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nRisks Related to Cash and Cash Equivalents and Corporate Indebtedness\nA significant portion of the Company's indebtedness has fixed interest rates, while its cash and cash equivalents generally have market interest rates. Based on account balances as of December 31, 2019, Lazard estimates that its annual operating income relating to cash and cash equivalents would increase by approximately $12 million in the event interest rates were to increase by 1% and decrease by approximately $12 million if rates were to decrease by 1%.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company's cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $1,232 million. Substantially all of the Company's cash and cash equivalents were invested in (i) highly liquid institutional money market funds (a significant majority of which were invested solely in U.S. Government or agency money market funds), (ii) short-term interest bearing and non-interest bearing accounts at a number of leading banks throughout the world, (iii) short-term certificates of deposit from such banks and (iv) short-term U.S. Treasury securities. Cash and cash equivalents are constantly monitored. On a regular basis, management reviews its investment profile as well as the credit profile of its list of depositor banks in order to adjust any deposit or investment thresholds as necessary.\nOperational Risk\nOperational risk is inherent in all of our businesses and may, for example, manifest itself in the form of errors, breaches in the system of internal controls, employee misconduct, business interruptions, fraud, including fraud perpetrated by third parties, or legal actions due to operating deficiencies or noncompliance. The Company maintains a framework including policies and a system of internal controls designed to monitor and manage operational risk and provide management with timely and accurate information. Management within each of the operating companies is primarily responsible for its operational risk programs. The Company has in place business continuity and disaster recovery programs that manage its capabilities to provide services in the case of a disruption. We purchase insurance policies designed to help protect the Company against accidental loss and losses that may significantly affect our financial objectives, personnel, property or our ability to continue to meet our responsibilities to our various stakeholder groups. See Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d above for more information regarding operational risk in our business.\nRecent Accounting Developments\nFor a discussion of recently issued accounting developments and their impact or potential impact on Lazard's consolidated financial statements, see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTable 205: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": " \u2022 Financial Advisory-The fundamentals for continued M&A activity and recent trends such as technological disruption and shareholder activism, which can be a catalyst for global strategic activity, appear to remain in place.

The Company hedges market exposure arising from a significant portion of our equity investment portfolios by entering into total return swaps. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a net decrease of approximately $1.0 million and $0.8 million in the carrying value of such investments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, including the effect of the hedging transactions.\n (b) Unfunded commitments to private equity investments consolidated but not owned by Lazard of $11,155 are excluded.

The Company hedges market exposure arising from a portion of our debt investment portfolios by entering into total return swaps. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse change in interest rates or credit spreads would result in a decrease of approximately $1.0 million and $0.9 million in the carrying value of such investments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, including the effect of the hedging transactions.\nThe Company has investments in a variety of asset classes, primarily debt and equity securities, and interests in alternative investments, debt, equity and private equity funds. The Company makes investments primarily to seed strategies in our Asset Management business or to reduce exposure arising from LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements. The Company measures its net economic exposure to market and other risks arising from investments that it owns, excluding (i) investments held in connection with LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements, (ii) investments in funds owned entirely by the noncontrolling interest holders of certain acquired entities and (iii) interest-bearing deposits with maturities over 90 days that allow daily withdrawals without principal penalties.\nOn October 31, 2019, Lazard Group distributed to its managing members, which are subsidiaries of Lazard Ltd, 17,000,000 shares of Class A common stock that were held by Lazard Group. These shares were ultimately received by Lazard Ltd and cancelled. There was no impact on total stockholders' equity as a result of the share cancellation.\nCertain Lazard fee and transaction statistics for the Financial Advisory segment are set forth below:\nCompensation and benefits expense is the largest component of our operating expenses. We seek to maintain discipline with respect to compensation, including the rate at which we award deferred compensation. Our goal is to maintain a ratio of awarded compensation and benefits expense to operating revenue and a ratio of adjusted compensation and benefits expense to operating revenue over the cycle in the mid- to high-50s percentage range. While we have implemented policies and initiatives that we believe will assist us in maintaining ratios within this range, there can be no guarantee that we will continue to maintain such ratios, or that our policies or initiatives will not change in the future. We may benefit from pressure on compensation costs within the financial services industry in future periods; however, increased competition for senior professionals, changes in the macroeconomic environment or the financial markets generally, lower operating revenue resulting from, for example, a decrease in M&A activity, our share of the M&A market or our AUM levels, changes in the mix of revenues from our businesses, investments in our businesses or various other factors could prevent us from achieving this goal.\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended

\n\nWe recognize a deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of greater than 50%) that a tax benefit will be accepted by a taxing authority. The measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based upon currently enacted tax rates in the applicable jurisdictions. At December 31, 2019, on a consolidated basis, we recorded gross deferred tax assets of approximately $737 million, with such amount partially offset by a valuation allowance of approximately $76 million (as described below).\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company's cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $1,232 million. Substantially all of the Company's cash and cash equivalents were invested in (i) highly liquid institutional money market funds (a significant majority of which were invested solely in U.S. Government or agency money market funds), (ii) short-term interest bearing and non-interest bearing accounts at a number of leading banks throughout the world, (iii) short-term certificates of deposit from such banks and (iv) short-term U.S. Treasury securities. Cash and cash equivalents are constantly monitored. On a regular basis, management reviews its investment profile as well as the credit profile of its list of depositor banks in order to adjust any deposit or investment thresholds as necessary.\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted Non-Compensation Expense:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 611,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 653,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 499,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expenses associated with business realignment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,922\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expenses associated with ERP system implementation (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17,359\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (27,495\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25,308\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expenses relating to office space reorganization (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,711\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,345\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,354\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Distribution fees, reimbursable deal costs and bad debt\nexpense (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (76,032\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (120,995\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Charges pertaining to senior debt refinancing (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,505\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,523\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noncontrolling interests (e)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,693\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,754\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,684\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expenses associated with the Lazard Foundation (f)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted non-compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 498,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 484,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 460,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted non-compensation expense, as\na % of operating revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLazard's annual cash flow generated from operations historically has been sufficient to enable it to meet its annual obligations.

Lazard recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met:\nLazard's consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars. Many of our non-U.S. subsidiaries have a functional currency (i.e., the currency in which operational activities are primarily conducted) that is other than the U.S. Dollar, generally the currency of the country in which the subsidiaries are domiciled. Such subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars using exchange rates as of the respective balance sheet date, while revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the respective periods based on the daily closing exchange rates.

Adjusted non-compensation expense increased $14 million, or 3%, as compared to 2018, primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure and increased\nIn addition, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, indenture and supplemental indentures relating to Lazard Group's senior notes contain certain other covenants (none of which relate to financial condition), events of default and other customary provisions. At December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all of these provisions. We may, to the extent required and subject to restrictions contained in our financing arrangements, use other financing sources, which may cause us to be subject to additional restrictions or covenants.\nNet revenue, operating income and cash receipts fluctuate significantly between periods. In the case of Financial Advisory, fee receipts are generally dependent upon the successful completion of client transactions, the occurrence and timing of which is irregular and not subject to Lazard's control.\n (g) An estimate, based on historical experience and future expectations, for future forfeitures of the deferred portion of such awards in order to present awarded compensation and benefits expense on a similar basis to that under U.S. GAAP, which also considers estimated forfeitures. \nAs of December 31, 2019 approximately 86% of our AUM was managed on behalf of institutional clients, including corporations, labor unions, public pension funds, insurance companies and banks, and through sub-advisory relationships, mutual fund sponsors, broker-dealers and registered advisors as compared to approximately 88% as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 14% of our AUM was managed on behalf of individual client relationships, which are principally with family offices and individuals, as compared to approximately 12% as of December 31, 2018.\nThe Board of Directors of Lazard has issued a series of authorizations to repurchase Class A common stock, which help offset the dilutive effect of our share-based incentive compensation plans. During a given year the Company intends to repurchase at least as many shares as it expects to ultimately issue pursuant to such compensation plans in respect of year-end incentive compensation attributable to the prior year. The rate at which the Company purchases shares in connection with this annual objective may vary from period to period due to a variety of factors. Purchases with respect to such program are set forth in the table below:\nAs reflected in the following table, which sets forth global M&A industry statistics, the value and number of all completed transactions, including the subset of completed transactions involving values greater than $500 million, decreased in 2019 as compared to 2018. With respect to announced M&A transactions, the value and number of all transactions, including the subset of announced transactions involving values greater than $500 million, are flat as compared to 2018, apart from the number of announced transactions involving values greater than $500 million, which decreased in 2019 as compared to 2018.\nGlobal restructuring activity during 2019, as measured by the number of corporate defaults, increased as compared to 2018. The number of defaulting issuers increased to 101 in 2019, according to Moody's Investors Service, Inc., as compared to 79 in 2018.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with Lazard Ltd's consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this Form 10-K\u201d). This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ significantly from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those set forth in the sections entitled Risk Factors\u201d and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nWe operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge continuously, and it is not possible for our management to predict all risks and uncertainties, nor can we assess the impact of all potentially applicable factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. See Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K. Furthermore, net income and revenue in any period may not be indicative of full-year results or the results of any other period and may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter.\nNet Revenue\nLazard is one of the world's preeminent financial advisory and asset management firms. We have long specialized in crafting solutions to the complex financial and strategic challenges of a diverse set of clients around the world, including corporations, governments, institutions, partnerships and individuals. Founded in 1848 in New Orleans, we currently operate from more than 40 cities and 25 countries across key business and financial centers in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and Central and South America.\nOur primary business purpose is to serve our clients. Our deep roots in business centers around the world form a global network of relationships with key decision-makers in corporations, governments and investing institutions. This network is both a competitive strength and a powerful resource for Lazard and our clients. As a firm that competes on the quality of our advice, we have two fundamental assets: our people and our reputation.\n \u2022 the fee or other transaction price has been determined; \n (a) Interest expense (excluding interest expense incurred by LFB) is added back in determining operating revenue because such expense relates to corporate financing activities and is not considered to be a cost directly related to the revenue of our business. \nOn January 29, 2020, the Board of Directors of Lazard declared a quarterly dividend of $0.47 per share on our Class A common stock. The dividend is payable on February 28, 2020, to stockholders of record on February 18, 2020.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\n\nAt December 31, 2019, total stockholders' equity was $682 million, as compared to $970 million and $1,259 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, including $610 million, $917 million and $1,200 million attributable to Lazard Ltd on the respective dates. The net activity in stockholders' equity during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 is reflected in the table below:\n \u2022 tax-planning strategies. \nCompensation and benefits expense, which included $57 million associated with business realignment in 2019, increased $49 million, or 3%, as compared to 2018.\n\nOperating income decreased $288 million, or 42%, as compared to 2018.\nThe cumulative liability relating to our obligations under the Amended and Restated Tax Receivable Agreement recorded as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $247 million and $271 million, respectively, and is recorded in tax receivable agreement obligation\u201d on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\n\nOperating Expenses\nAsset Management net revenue decreased $94 million, or 7%, as compared to 2018. Management fees and other revenue was $1,216 million, a decrease of $95 million, or 7%, as compared to $1,311 million in 2018, primarily due to a decrease in average AUM and change in asset mix. Incentive fees were unchanged as compared to 2018.\n (i) the deferred incentive compensation awards granted in the year-end compensation process with respect to the fiscal year (e.g., deferred incentive compensation awards granted in 2020 related to the 2019 year-end compensation process), including performance-based restricted stock unit ( PRSU\u201d) and performance-based restricted participation unit ( PRPU\u201d) awards (based on the target payout level); \naccount all available information, we cannot determine that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets held by these entities will be realized. Consequently, we have recorded valuation allowances on $76 million of deferred tax assets held by these entities as of December 31, 2019.\nThe following is a summary of changes in AUM by asset class for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nThe majority of Lazard's Financial Advisory net revenue historically has been earned from the successful completion of M&A transactions, capital advisory services, capital raising, restructuring, shareholder advisory, sovereign advisory and other strategic advisory matters. The main drivers of Financial Advisory net revenue are overall M&A activity, the level of corporate debt defaults and the environment for capital raising activities, particularly in the industries and geographic markets in which Lazard focuses. In some client engagements, often those involving financially distressed companies, revenue is earned in the form of retainers and similar fees that are contractually agreed upon with each client for each assignment and are not necessarily linked to the completion of a transaction. In addition, Lazard also earns fees from providing strategic advice to clients, with such fees not being dependent on a specific transaction, and may also earn fees in connection with public and private securities offerings. Significant fluctuations in Financial Advisory net revenue can occur over the course of any given year, because a significant portion of such net revenue is earned upon the successful completion of a transaction, restructuring or capital raising activity, the timing of which is uncertain and is not subject to Lazard's control.\n (ii) the portion of investments in people (e.g., sign-on\u201d bonuses or retention awards) and other special deferred incentive compensation awards that is applicable to the fiscal year the award becomes effective; and \nFinancial Advisory\nThe table below sets forth our corporate indebtedness as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The agreements with respect to this indebtedness are discussed in more detail in our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nThe following table summarizes the reported operating results attributable to the Financial Advisory segment:\n (a) See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding business realignment. \n (a) See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding business realignment. \n \u2022 future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; \nPrivate Equity-The Company invests in private equity primarily as a part of its co-investment activities and in connection with certain legacy businesses. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company's exposure to changes in fair value of such investments was approximately $24 million and $42 million, respectively. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in fair value would result in a decrease of approximately $2.4 million and $4.2 million in the carrying value of such investments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nEconomic and global financial market conditions can materially affect our financial performance. As described above, our principal sources of revenue are derived from activities in our Financial Advisory and Asset Management business segments. As our Financial Advisory revenues are primarily dependent on the successful completion of merger, acquisition, restructuring, capital raising or similar transactions, and our Asset Management revenues are primarily driven by the levels of assets under management, weak economic and global financial market conditions can result in a challenging business environment for M&A and capital-raising activity as well as our Asset Management business, but may provide opportunities for our restructuring business.\nFor a discussion of recently issued accounting developments and their impact or potential impact on Lazard's consolidated financial statements, see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn addition to the discussion above regarding deferred tax assets and associated valuation allowances, as well as unrecognized tax benefit liability estimates, other factors affect our provision for income taxes, including changes in the geographic mix of our business, the level of our annual pre-tax income, transfer pricing and intercompany transactions.\nAdjusted compensation and benefits expense was $1,464 million, a decrease of $53 million, or 3%, as compared to $1,517 million in 2018. The ratio of adjusted compensation and benefits expense to operating revenue was 57.5% for 2019, as compared to 55.1% for 2018. Awarded compensation and benefits expense in 2019 was $1,469 million, a decrease of $68 million, or 4%, when compared to $1,537 million in 2018. The ratio of awarded compensation and benefits expense to operating revenue was 57.7%, as compared to 55.8% for 2018. The year-end deferred incentive compensation awarded for 2019 was $361 million, representing a decrease of $17 million, or 4%, as compared to 2018. As described above, when analyzing compensation and benefits expense on a full-year basis, we believe that awarded compensation and benefits expense provides the most meaningful basis for comparison of compensation and benefits expense between present, historical and future years.\nBusiness Summary\nAs of December 31, 2019, a total of $401 million of share repurchase authorization remained available under the Company's share repurchase program, $101 million of which will expire on December 31, 2020 and $300 million of which will expire on December 31, 2021.\nM&A and other advisory and Asset Management fees are generally collected within 60 days of billing, while Restructuring fee collections may extend beyond 60 days, particularly those that involve bankruptcies with court-ordered holdbacks. Fees from our Private Capital Advisory activities are generally collected over a four-year period from billing and typically include an interest component.\nGenerally, when the Company initially invests to seed an investment entity, the Company is the majority owner of the entity. Our majority ownership in seed investment entities represents a controlling interest, except when we are the general partner in such entities and the third-party investors have the right to replace the general partner. To the extent material, we consolidate seed and LFI investment entities in which we own a controlling interest, and we would deconsolidate any such entity when we no longer have a controlling interest in such entity.\nFor hedge funds, incentive fees are calculated based on a specified percentage of a fund's net appreciation, in some cases in excess of established benchmarks or thresholds. The Company records incentive fees on traditional products and hedge funds at the end of the relevant performance measurement period, when potential uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizable amounts have been determined. The incentive fee measurement period is generally an annual period (unless an account terminates or redemption occurs during the year). The incentive fees received at the end of the measurement period are not subject to reversal or payback. Incentive fees on hedge funds are often subject to loss carryforward provisions in which losses incurred by the hedge funds in any year are applied against certain gains realized by the hedge funds in future periods before any incentive fees can be earned.\n (e) Represents write-down of a private equity investment to the potential transaction value. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\n\nAverage AUM for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 for each significant asset class is set forth below. Average AUM generally represents the average of the monthly ending AUM balances for the period.\n \u2022 taxable income in prior carryback years; and \nFinancial Advisory Results of Operations\nLiquidity is also affected by the level of deposits and other customer payables, principally at LFB. To the extent that such deposits and other customer payables rise or fall, this has a corresponding impact on liquidity held at LFB, with the majority of such amounts generally being recorded in deposits with banks and short-term investments\u201d. In the year ended December 31, 2019, as reflected on the consolidated statements of financial condition, both deposits with banks and short-term investments\u201d and deposits and other customer payables\u201d increased as compared to December 31, 2018, due to a higher level of LFB customer-related demand deposits, primarily from clients and funds managed by LFG.\nWe believe that adjusted non-compensation expense\u201d, a non-GAAP measure, provides a more meaningful basis for our investors to assess our operating results. For calculations with respect to adjusted non-compensation expense\u201d, see the table under Consolidated Results of Operations\u201d below.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n (d) Represents private equity investments that are consolidated but owned by noncontrolling interests, and therefore do not subject the Company to market or credit risk. The applicable noncontrolling interests are presented within stockholders' equity\u201d on the consolidated statements of financial condition. \nThe Company also records derivative liabilities relating to its obligations pertaining to LFI awards and other similar deferred compensation arrangements, the fair value of which is based on the value of the underlying investments, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. Changes in the fair value of the derivative liabilities are equally offset by the changes in the fair value of investments which are expected to be delivered upon settlement of LFI awards. Derivative liabilities relating to LFI amounted to $226 million and $188 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of Lazard's consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, Lazard evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, income taxes (including the impact on the tax receivable agreement obligation), investing activities and goodwill. Lazard bases these estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments, including judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities, that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $6 million as compared to 2018.\nThe weight we give to any particular item is, in part, dependent upon the degree to which it can be objectively verified. We give greater weight to the recent results of operations of a relevant entity. Pre-tax operating losses on a three year cumulative basis or lack of sustainable profitability are considered objectively verifiable evidence and will generally outweigh a projection of future taxable income.\n (f) Represents special deferred incentive awards that are granted outside the year-end compensation process, and includes grants to new hires, retention awards and performance units earned under PRSU grants. \nLiquidity is significantly impacted by cash payments for, or in respect of, incentive compensation, a significant portion of which are made during the first three months of the year. As a consequence, cash on hand generally declines in the beginning of the year and gradually builds over the remainder of the year. We also pay certain tax advances during the year on behalf of certain managing directors, which serve to reduce their respective incentive compensation payments. We expect this seasonal pattern of cash flow to continue.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Lazard Group and entities in which it has a controlling interest. Lazard determines whether it has a controlling interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity ( VOE\u201d) or a variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d) under U.S. GAAP.\nOperating expenses, which included $16 million associated with business realignment in 2019, decreased $25 million, or 3%, as compared to 2018, primarily due to a decrease in compensation and benefits expense associated with decreased operating revenue as well as lower fund administration fees.\nThe following table shows the composition of AUM for the Asset Management segment (see Item 1, Business-Principal Business Lines-Asset Management-Investment Strategies\u201d):\nSee Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Income Taxes\u201d below and Notes 19 and 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes, the impact of the Tax Act on us, our deferred tax assets and the tax receivable agreement obligation.\nLazard Ltd, through its subsidiaries, is subject to U.S. federal income taxes on all of its U.S. operating income, as well as on the portion of non-U.S. income attributable to its U.S. subsidiaries. In addition, Lazard Ltd, through its subsidiaries, is subject to state and local taxes on its income apportioned to various state and local jurisdictions. Outside the U.S., Lazard Group operates principally through subsidiary corporations that are subject to local income taxes in foreign jurisdictions. Lazard Group is also subject to Unincorporated Business Tax ( UBT\u201d) attributable to its operations apportioned to New York City.\n \u2022 Asset Management-In the short to intermediate term, we expect most investor demand will come through financial institutions, and from defined benefit and defined contribution plans in developed economies because of their sheer scope and size. Over the longer term, and depending upon local market conditions, we would expect an increasing share of our AUM to come from the developing economies around the globe, as their retirement systems evolve and individual wealth is increasingly deployed in the financial markets. Given our diversified investment platform and our ability to provide investment solutions for a global mix of clients, we believe we are positioned to benefit from opportunities across the asset management industry. We are continually developing and seeding new investment strategies that extend our existing platforms and assessing potential product acquisitions or other inorganic growth opportunities. Recent examples of growth initiatives include the following investment strategies: various Quantitative Equity strategies, explainable AI capabilities, a U.S. Systematic Equity strategy, and sustainable investment strategies. \nassumptions regarding potential future operating profitability. The assumptions reflected in the estimate involve significant judgment, and if our structure were to change or our annual taxable income were to increase, we could be required to accelerate payments under the Amended and Restated Tax Receivable Agreement. As such, the actual amount and timing of payments under the Amended and Restated Tax Receivable Agreement could differ materially from our estimates. Any changes in the amount of the estimated liability would be recorded as a non-compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations. Adjustments, if necessary, to the related deferred tax assets would be recorded through income tax expense.\n\nTotal AUM at December 31, 2019 was $248 billion, an increase of $33 billion, or 16%, as compared to total AUM of $215 billion at December 31, 2018, due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows and foreign exchange depreciation. Average AUM for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $7 billion, or 3%, as compared to 2018.\nDuring the period ended June 30, 2015, we released substantially all of our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. As a result, we accrued a corresponding liability during the period ended June 30, 2015 for amounts relating to the Second Amended and Restated Tax Receivable Agreement, dated as of October 26, 2015 (the Amended and Restated Tax Receivable Agreement\u201d), between Lazard and LTBP Trust (the Trust\u201d). See Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Amended and Restated Tax Receivable Agreement.\n\n (e) Deferred incentive compensation awards applicable to the relevant year-end compensation process (e.g., deferred incentive compensation awards granted in 2020, 2019 and 2018 related to the 2019, 2018 and 2017 year-end compensation processes, respectively). \nWe actively monitor our regulatory capital base. Our principal subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements in their respective jurisdictions to ensure their general financial soundness and liquidity, which require, among other things, that we comply with rules regarding certain minimum capital requirements, record-keeping, reporting procedures, relationships with customers, experience and training requirements for employees and certain other requirements and procedures. These regulatory requirements may restrict the flow of funds to and from affiliates. See Note 22 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. These regulations differ in the U.S., the U.K., France and other countries in which we operate. Our capital structure is designed to provide each of our subsidiaries with capital and liquidity consistent with its business and regulatory requirements. For a discussion of regulations relating to us, see Item 1, Business-Regulation\u201d included in this Form 10-K.\nOverall, we continue to focus on the development of our business, including the generation of stable revenue growth, earnings growth and shareholder returns, the evaluation of potential growth opportunities, the investment in new technology to support the development of existing and new business opportunities, the prudent management of our costs and expenses, the efficient use of our assets and the return of capital to our shareholders.\n</table>\nWith respect to fees receivable from Financial Advisory activities, such receivables are generally deemed past due when they are outstanding 60 days from the date of invoice. However, some Financial Advisory transactions include specific contractual payment terms that may vary from one month to four years (as is the case for our Private Capital Advisory fees) following the invoice date or may be subject to court approval (as is the case with restructuring assignments that include bankruptcy proceedings). In such cases, receivables are deemed past due\nThe amount of the Amended and Restated Tax Receivable Agreement liability is an undiscounted amount based upon currently enacted tax laws, including the Tax Act, the current structure of the Company and various\n (a) During March 2019, Lazard Group completed an offering of $500,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes. Interest on the 2029 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 11 and September 11 of each year, beginning September 11, 2019. Lazard Group used a portion of the net proceeds of the 2029 Notes during March and April 2019 to redeem or otherwise retire the remaining $250,000 of the 2020 Notes. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nThe geographical distribution of Asset Management net revenue is set forth below in percentage terms, and is based on the Lazard offices that manage and distribute the respective AUM amounts. Such geographical distribution may not be reflective of the geography of the investment products or clients.\n (e) Expenses related to the consolidation of noncontrolling interests are excluded because the Company has no economic interest in such amounts. \nYear Ended December 31, 2019 versus December 31, 2018\nFinancial Advisory\nIf, in Lazard's judgment, collection of a fee is not probable, Lazard will not recognize revenue until the uncertainty is removed. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide coverage for estimated losses from our receivables. We determine the adequacy of the allowance by estimating the probability of loss based on our analysis of the client's creditworthiness and specifically reserve against exposures where we determine the receivables are impaired, which may include situations where a fee is in dispute or litigation has commenced.\nAlthough Corporate segment net revenue during 2019 is not significant compared to Lazard's net revenue, total assets in the Corporate segment represented 65% of Lazard's consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2019, which are attributable to cash and cash equivalents, investments in debt and equity securities, interests in alternative investment, debt, equity and private equity funds, deferred tax assets and certain assets associated with LFB.\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Selected financial data derived from the Company's reported consolidated results of operations is set forth below, followed by a more detailed discussion of both the consolidated and business segment results.\nOur operating expenses also include our benefit pursuant to the tax receivable agreement\u201d (which, in 2017, was offset by the charges described below relating to the Tax Act) and amortization and other acquisition-related (benefits) costs\u201d, which includes the change in fair value of the contingent consideration associated with business acquisitions.\nWe conducted a review of our business, which resulted in a realignment that included employee reductions and the closing of subscale offices and investment strategies, most of which were completed during the third quarter of 2019. We believe these actions better align the business with changes in the marketplace and create greater flexibility to focus on strategic growth opportunities. These actions resulted in expenses of $68 million in 2019. See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe Company reported net income attributable to Lazard Ltd of $287 million, as compared to net income attributable to Lazard Ltd of $527 million in 2018.\nLazard makes seed and LFI investments in certain entities that are considered VOEs and VIEs and often require consolidation as a result of our investment. The impact of seed and LFI investment entities that require consolidation on the consolidated financial statements, including any consolidation or deconsolidation of such entities, is not material to our financial statements. Our exposure to loss from entities in which we have made such investments is limited to the extent of our investment in, or investment commitment to, such entities. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Investments\u201d above for more information regarding our investments.\nOperational Risk\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company did not consolidate or deconsolidate any seed investment entities or LFI investment entities, with the exception of the recent consolidation of certain LFI funds (see Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). As such, 100% of the recorded balance of seed investments and substantially all of LFI investments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 represented the Company's economic interest in the seed and LFI investments. See -Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities\u201d below for more information on the Company's policy regarding the consolidation of seed and LFI investment entities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company had in place trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, pursuant to which it effected stock repurchases in the open market.\nDuring March 2019, Lazard Group completed an offering of the 2029 Notes. Lazard Group used a portion of the net proceeds of the 2029 Notes to redeem or otherwise retire the remaining 2020 Notes in transactions that occurred during March 2019 and April 2019.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nThe Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains customary terms and conditions, including limitations on consolidations, mergers, indebtedness and certain payments, as well as financial condition covenants relating to leverage and interest coverage ratios. Lazard Group's obligations under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement may be accelerated upon customary events of default, including non-payment of principal or interest, breaches of covenants, cross-defaults to other material debt, a change in control and specified bankruptcy events.\n \u2022 Variable Interest Entities. VIEs are entities that lack one or more of the characteristics of a VOE. If Lazard has a variable interest, or a combination of variable interests, in a VIE, it is required to analyze whether it needs to consolidate such VIE. Lazard is required to consolidate a VIE if we are the primary beneficiary having (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of, or receive benefits from, the VIE that could be potentially significant to the VIE. \nA portion of our net revenue is derived from transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was negatively impacted, and net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was positively impacted, by exchange rate movements, in each case in comparison to the relevant prior year period. The majority of the impact to net revenue, in both periods, was offset by the impact of the exchange rate movements on our operating expenses during the years denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.\n\n\n (b) Represents incremental rent expense and lease abandonment costs related to office space reorganization. \nCertain of our tax-paying entities have individually experienced losses on a cumulative three year basis or have tax attributes that may expire unused. In addition, one of our tax-paying entities has recorded a valuation allowance on substantially all of its deferred tax assets due to the combined effect of operating losses in certain subsidiaries of that entity as well as foreign taxes that together substantially offset any U.S. tax liability. Taking into\n (a) The tax withholding portion of share-based compensation is settled in cash, not shares. \n (b) Represents certain distribution fees, reimbursable deal costs paid to third parties and bad debt expense relating to fees that are deemed uncollectible for which an equal amount is excluded for purposes of determining adjusted non-compensation expense. \nYear Ended December 31, 2019 versus December 31, 2018\nCorporate segment net revenue consists primarily of investment gains and losses on the Company's seed investments\u201d related to our Asset Management business and principal investments in private equity funds, net of hedging activities, as well as gains and losses on investments held in connection with Lazard Fund Interests ( LFI\u201d) and interest income and interest expense. Corporate net revenue also can fluctuate due to changes in the fair value of debt and equity securities, as well as due to changes in interest and currency exchange rates and in the levels of cash, investments and indebtedness.\nBusiness Segments\n (a) Includes the impact of business realignment as of December 31, 2019. \nInvestments\nThe assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted also considers all available information, including the following:\nInflows in the Equity asset class were primarily attributable to the Global, Local and Multi-Regional platforms, and inflows in the Fixed Income asset class were primarily attributable to the Global, Multi-Regional and Emerging Markets platforms. Outflows in the Equity asset class were primarily attributable to the Emerging Markets, Global and Multi-Regional equity platforms, and outflows in the Fixed Income asset class were primarily attributable to the Emerging Markets and Global platforms.\nThe Company makes cash payments for, or in respect of, a significant portion of its incentive compensation during the first three months of each calendar year with respect to the prior year's results. The Company also paid a special dividend in 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Company plans to continue to deploy excess cash and may do so in a variety of ways, which may include repurchasing outstanding shares of Class A common stock, paying dividends to stockholders and repurchasing its outstanding debt.\nLazard believes that the critical accounting policies set forth below comprise the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 Asset Management, which offers a broad range of global investment solutions and investment management services in equity and fixed income strategies, asset allocation strategies, alternative investments and private equity funds to corporations, public funds, sovereign entities, endowments and foundations, labor funds, financial intermediaries and private clients. \n (a) Expenses related to the consolidation of noncontrolling interests are excluded because Lazard has no economic interest in such amounts. \nThe Company's managing directors and many of its professionals have significant experience, and many of them are able to use this experience to advise on M&A, restructuring and other strategic advisory matters, depending on clients' needs. This flexibility allows Lazard to better match its professionals with the counter-cyclical business cycles of mergers and acquisitions and restructurings. While Lazard measures revenue by practice area, Lazard does not separately measure the costs or profitability of M&A services as compared to restructuring or other services. Accordingly, Lazard measures performance in its Financial Advisory segment based on overall segment operating revenue and operating income margins.\nLFB engages in lending activities, including commitments to extend credit (primarily for clients of LFG). At December 31, 2019 and 2018, customer receivables included $76 million and $64 million, respectively, of LFB loans, with such loans being fully collateralized and closely monitored for counterparty creditworthiness.\nFinancial Advisory operating income was $148 million, a decrease of $208 million, or 58%, as compared to operating income of $357 million in 2018 and, as a percentage of net revenue, was 10.8%, as compared to 22.9% in 2018.\nOperating expenses, which included $40 million associated with business realignment in 2019, increased $27 million, or 2%, as compared to 2018.\nWe consider multiple possible sources of taxable income when assessing a valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset, including:\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 versus December 31, 2018\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income taxes for each of our tax-paying entities in its respective jurisdiction. In addition to estimating actual current tax liabilities for these jurisdictions, we also must account for the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting of items, such as basis adjustments, compensation and benefits expense, and depreciation and amortization. Differences which are temporary in nature result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets and our unrecognized tax benefits.\n (d) Includes base salaries and benefits of $705,156, $695,398 and $648,130 for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and cash incentive compensation of $390,852, $445,462 and $465,582 for the respective years. \nThe fees that we receive for providing investment management and advisory services are primarily driven by the level of AUM and the nature of the AUM product mix. Accordingly, market movements, foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changes in our AUM product mix will impact the level of revenues we receive from our Asset Management business when comparing periodic results. A substantial portion of our AUM is invested in equities. Movements in AUM during the period generally reflect the changes in equity market indices.\nNet revenue trends in Financial Advisory are generally correlated to the level of completed industry-wide M&A transactions and restructuring transactions occurring subsequent to corporate debt defaults, respectively. However, deviations from this relationship can occur in any given year for a number of reasons. For instance, our results can diverge from industry-wide activity where there are material variances from the level of industry-wide M&A activity in a particular market where Lazard has significant market share, or regarding the relative number of our advisory engagements with respect to larger-sized transactions, and where we are involved in non-public or sovereign advisory assignments.\n (iii) amounts in excess of the target payout level for PRSU and PRPU awards at the end of their respective performance periods; and \nCredit Concentrations\n\n \u2022 nature, frequency, magnitude and duration of any past losses and current operating results; \nWe regularly monitor our liquidity position, including cash levels, investments in U.S. Treasury securities, credit lines, principal investment commitments, interest and principal payments on debt, capital expenditures, dividend payments, purchases of shares of Class A common stock and matters relating to liquidity and to compliance with regulatory net capital requirements. At December 31, 2019, Lazard had approximately $1,232 million of cash, with such amount including approximately $612 million held at Lazard's operations outside the U.S. Lazard provides for income taxes on substantially all of its foreign earnings. We expect that no material amount of additional taxes would be recognized upon receipt of dividends or distributions of such earnings from our foreign operations.\nRisks Related to Cash and Cash Equivalents and Corporate Indebtedness\nOn January 1, 2017, we adopted new accounting guidance on share-based incentive compensation. As a result of the adoption of this new guidance, we recognized excess tax benefits of $11 million, $33 million and $9 million from the vesting of share-based incentive compensation in the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Upon adoption of the new guidance, we also recorded deferred tax assets of $82 million, net of a valuation allowance of $12 million, for previously unrecognized excess tax benefits (including tax benefits from dividends or dividend equivalents) on share-based incentive compensation, with an offsetting adjustment to retained earnings. The new guidance has since January 1, 2017 affected, and the Company expects that in future periods the new guidance will affect, the provision for income taxes for the delivery of stock under share-based incentive compensation arrangements, as well as the effective tax rate in the relevant periods, which could be material to the consolidated statements of operations and the classification of cash flows in the relevant periods.\n (f) Represents losses associated with the closing of certain offices as part of business realignment. \nCertain market data with respect to our Financial Advisory and Asset Management businesses is included below.\n\nWe operate in cyclical businesses across multiple geographies, industries and asset classes. In recent years, we have expanded our geographic reach, bolstered our industry expertise and continued to build in growth areas. Companies, government bodies and investors seek independent advice with a geographic perspective, deep understanding of capital structure, informed research and knowledge of global, regional and local economic conditions. We believe that our business model as an independent advisor will continue to create opportunities for us to attract new clients and key personnel.\nSee Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d and Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to income taxes.\nOperating expenses, which included (i) in 2019, $8 million associated with business realignment and (ii) in 2018, $10 million relating to expenses associated with an unconditional commitment to the Lazard Foundation, increased $46 million in 2019, primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense, which reflected an increase in charges pertaining to LFI.\n \u2022 Financial Advisory, which offers corporate, partnership, institutional, government, sovereign and individual clients across the globe a wide array of financial advisory services regarding mergers and acquisitions ( M&A\u201d), capital advisory, restructurings, shareholder advisory, sovereign advisory, capital raising and other strategic advisory matters, and \n\n \u2022 the performance obligations in the contract have been identified; \nThe following table sets forth information relating to Lazard's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019:\nThe following is a discussion of net revenue and operating income for the Company's segments: Financial Advisory, Asset Management and Corporate. Each segment's operating expenses include (i) compensation and benefits expenses that are incurred directly in support of the segment and (ii) other operating expenses, which include directly incurred expenses for occupancy and equipment, marketing and business development, technology and information services, professional services, fund administration and outsourcing, and indirect support costs (including compensation and benefits expense and other operating expenses related thereto) for administrative services. Such administrative services include, but are not limited to, accounting, tax, human resources, legal, information technology, facilities management and senior management activities. Such support costs are allocated to the relevant segments based on various statistical drivers such as revenue, headcount, square footage and other factors.\n (a) No individual client constituted more than 10% of our Financial Advisory segment net revenue in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. \n \u2022 we add incentive compensation with respect to the fiscal year, which is comprised of: \nInvestments consist primarily of interest-bearing deposits, debt and equity securities, and interests in alternative investment, debt, equity and private equity funds.\nWe also use adjusted compensation and benefits expense\u201d and the ratio of adjusted compensation and benefits expense\u201d to operating revenue,\u201d both non-GAAP measures, for comparison of compensation and benefits expense between periods. For the reconciliations and calculations with respect to adjusted compensation and benefits expense\u201d and awarded compensation and benefits expense\u201d and related ratios to operating revenue,\u201d see the table under Consolidated Results of Operations\u201d below.\nTable 205: <table> <tr> <td>\nEquity market indices for major markets at December 31, 2019 generally increased as compared to such indices at December 31, 2018. Equity market indices for major markets at December 31, 2018 generally decreased as compared to such indices at December 31, 2017.\nSee Notes 15 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Lazard's stockholders' equity and incentive plans, respectively.\nOperating Results\n \u2022 we reduce the amounts in (i), (ii) and (iii) above by an estimate of future forfeitures with respect to such awards. \nConsolidation\n\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, total investments with a fair value of $531 million and $575 million, respectively, included $34 million and $57 million, respectively, or 6% and 10%, respectively, of investments that were classified using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient. See Notes 6 and 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding investments measured at fair value, including the levels of fair value within which such measurements of fair value fall.\nLazard's consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars. Many of Lazard's non-U.S. subsidiaries have a functional currency (i.e., the currency in which operational activities are primarily conducted) that is other than the U.S. Dollar, generally the currency of the country in which such subsidiaries are domiciled. Such subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at the respective balance sheet date exchange rates, while revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year based on the daily closing exchange rates. Adjustments that result from translating amounts from a subsidiary's functional currency are reported as a component of stockholders' equity. Foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on transactions in non-functional currencies are included on the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nWe maintain lines of credit in excess of anticipated liquidity requirements. As of December 31, 2019, Lazard had approximately $168 million in unused lines of credit available to it, including a $150 million, five-year, senior revolving credit facility with a group of lenders that expires in September 2020 (the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\u201d) (see -Financing Activities\u201d below) and unused lines of credit available to LFB of approximately $17 million.\nEarnings from operations decreased $171 million, or 23%, as compared to 2018, and, as a percentage of operating revenue, was 22.9%, as compared to 27.4% in 2018.\nOperating Activities\n (b) Represents changes in fair value of the compensation liability recorded in connection with LFI and other similar deferred incentive compensation awards for which a corresponding equal amount is excluded from operating revenue. \n\n\n \u2022 the fee or other transaction price has been allocated to each performance obligation in the contract; and \nOur operating expenses also include non-compensation expense\u201d, which includes costs for occupancy and equipment, marketing and business development, technology and information services, professional services, fund administration and outsourced services and other expenses. Our occupancy costs represent a significant portion of our aggregate operating expenses and are subject to change from time to time, particularly as leases for real property expire and are renewed or replaced with new, long-term leases for the same or other real property.\n (a) Includes in 2019, 2018 and 2017, benefits of $503, $6,495 and $202,546, respectively, pursuant to the tax receivable agreement. \nThe following table summarizes the reported operating results attributable to the Corporate segment:\nThe following table summarizes the reported operating results attributable to the Asset Management segment:\nAs of February 18, 2020, AUM was $247.8 billion, a $0.4 billion decrease since December 31, 2019. The decrease in AUM was due to foreign exchange depreciation of $3.7 billion and net outflows of $1.4 billion, offset by market appreciation of $4.7 billion.\nThe majority of Lazard's operating expenses relate to compensation and benefits for managing directors and employees. Our compensation and benefits expense includes (i) salaries and benefits, (ii) amortization of the relevant portion of previously granted deferred incentive compensation awards, including (a) share-based incentive compensation under the Lazard Ltd 2018 Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2018 Plan\u201d) and the Lazard Ltd 2008 Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2008 Plan\u201d), and (b) LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements (see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), (iii) a provision for discretionary or guaranteed cash bonuses and profit pools and (iv) when applicable, severance payments. Compensation expense in any given period is dependent on many factors, including general economic and market conditions, our actual and forecasted operating and financial performance, staffing levels, estimated forfeiture rates, competitive pay conditions and the nature of revenues earned, as well as the mix between current and deferred compensation.\nThe Company earns performance-based incentive fees on various investment products, including traditional products and alternative investment funds, such as hedge funds and private equity funds.\n (d) In 2019 and 2018, represents charges pertaining to the redemption of the Company's 4.25% senior notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes\u201d), due to the non-operating nature of such transaction. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Financing Activities.\u201d \nRecent Accounting Developments\n (b) Includes net changes in operating assets and liabilities. \n (a) At December 31, 2019 and 2018, seed investments in directly owned equity securities were invested as follows: \nOur principal sources of revenue are derived from activities in the following business segments:\nThese investments, with the exception of interest-bearing deposits, are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition, and any increases or decreases in the fair value of these investments are reflected in earnings. The fair value of investments is generally based upon market prices or the net asset value ( NAV\u201d) or its equivalent for investments in funds. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the measurement of the fair value of investments.\nLazard's Asset Management segment principally includes LAM, LFG and Edgewater. Asset Management net revenue is derived from fees for investment management and advisory services provided to clients. As noted above, the main driver of Asset Management net revenue is the level and product mix of AUM, which is generally influenced by the performance of the global equity markets and, to a lesser extent, fixed income markets as well as Lazard's investment performance, which impacts its ability to successfully attract and retain assets. As a result, fluctuations (including timing thereof) in financial markets and client asset inflows and outflows have a direct effect on Asset Management net revenue and operating income. Asset Management fees are generally based on the level of AUM measured daily, monthly or quarterly, and an increase or reduction in AUM, due to market price fluctuations, currency fluctuations, changes in product mix, or net client asset flows will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in management fees. The majority of our investment advisory contracts are generally terminable at any time or on notice of 30 days or less. Institutional and individual clients, and firms with which we have strategic alliances, can terminate their relationship with us, reduce the aggregate amount of AUM or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for a number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates and financial market performance. In addition, as Lazard's AUM includes significant amounts of assets that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. Dollars, changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies will impact the value of Lazard's AUM and the overall amount of management fees generated by the AUM. Fees vary with the type of assets managed and the vehicle in which they are managed, with higher fees earned on equity assets and alternative investment funds, such as hedge funds and private equity funds, and lower fees earned on fixed income and cash management products.\nLazard enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge exposures to currency exchange rates and interest rates and uses total return swap contracts on various equity and debt indices to hedge a portion of its market exposure with respect to certain seed investments related to our Asset Management business. Derivative contracts are recorded at fair value. Derivative assets amounted to $1 million and $12 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and derivative liabilities, excluding the derivative liability arising from the Company's obligation pertaining to LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements, amounted to $10 million and $1 million at such respective dates.\nFinancial Advisory net revenue decreased $181 million, or 12%, as compared to 2018. The decrease in Financial Advisory net revenue was primarily a result of a decrease in the number of fees greater than $5 million as compared to 2018.\nNet revenue decreased $240 million, or 8%, with operating revenue decreasing $209 million, or 8%, as compared to 2018. Fee revenue from investment banking and other advisory activities decreased $183 million, or 12%, as compared to 2018. Asset management fees, including incentive fees, decreased $88 million, or 7%, as compared to 2018. In the aggregate, interest income, other revenue and interest expense increased $31 million as compared to 2018.\n (d) Represents changes in the fair value of investments held in connection with LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements for which a corresponding equal amount is excluded from compensation and benefits expense. \nLazard is a holding company that is treated as a publicly traded partnership for U.S. tax purposes, and our U.S. and certain foreign subsidiaries were impacted by the Tax Act. See Notes 19 and 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the impact of the Tax Act on us.\nIn addition, we record selected other activities in our Corporate segment, including management of cash, investments, deferred tax assets, outstanding indebtedness, certain contingent obligations, and assets and liabilities associated with Lazard Group's Paris-based subsidiary, Lazard Fr\u00e8res Banque SA ( LFB\u201d).\n (c) At December 31, 2019 and 2018, includes investments in U.S. Treasury securities of approximately $100 million and $200 million, respectively, with original maturities of greater than three months and less than one year. \nSee Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding senior debt.\nEffect of Inflation\nAs of December 31, 2019, AUM with foreign currency exposure represented approximately 67% of our total AUM, as compared to 70% at December 31, 2018. AUM with foreign currency exposure generally declines in value with the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar and increases in value as the U.S. Dollar weakens, with all other factors held constant.\nStockholders' Equity\n\n\n Source: Dealogic as of January 3, 2020. \n \u2022 Voting Interest Entities. VOEs are entities in which (i) the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance itself independently and (ii) the equity holders have the obligation to absorb losses, the right to receive residual returns and the right to make decisions about the entity's activities. Lazard is required to consolidate a VOE if it holds a majority of the voting interest in such VOE. \nThe Company's liquidity and capital resources are derived from operating activities, financing activities and equity offerings.\nRisks Related to Receivables\nSubsequent to the initial recognition of deferred tax assets, we also must continually assess the likelihood that such deferred tax assets will be realized. If we determine that we may not fully derive the benefit from a deferred tax asset, we consider whether it would be appropriate to apply a valuation allowance against the applicable deferred tax asset, taking into account all available information. The ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset for a particular entity depends, among other things, on the generation of taxable income by such entity in the applicable jurisdiction.\nOther revenue increased $56 million as compared to 2018, primarily due to higher income in 2019 attributable to investments held in connection with LFI.\nFinancial Statement Overview\n (a) Represents expenses associated with the Enterprise Resource Planning ( ERP\u201d) system implementation. \nThe tables below describe the components of operating revenue, adjusted and awarded compensation and benefits expense, adjusted non-compensation expense, earnings from operations and related key ratios, which are non-GAAP measures used by the Company to manage its business. We believe such non-GAAP measures provide the most meaningful basis for comparison between present, historical and future periods, as described above.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk-At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company's exposure to foreign exchange rate risk in its investment portfolio, which primarily relates to investments in foreign currency denominated equity and debt securities, was $37 million and $41 million, respectively. A significant portion of the Company's foreign currency exposure related to our equity and debt investment portfolios is hedged through the aforementioned total return swaps. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar would result in a decrease of approximately $0.2 million and $0.1 million in the carrying value of such investments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, including the effect of the hedging transactions.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) was enacted. The Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax system by, among other changes, lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, implementing a partial territorial tax system and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on the deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Act also included several provisions that limited the benefit of the tax rate reduction, such as restricting the deductibility of interest expense and other corporate business expenses. The Tax Act further included anti-base erosion provisions such as the BEAT and tax on GILTI. The GILTI provisions impose a tax on certain income from foreign operations and we have elected to account for the tax on GILTI as a current period expense.\n (b) Reduction in the Corporate segment in 2018 relates to a realignment of certain headcount from Corporate to the Financial Advisory and Asset Management segments. \nEither directly, or through our third-party vendors, we perform a variety of regular due diligence procedures on our pricing service providers. Those procedures include oversight by our internal operations group, review of the pricing service providers' internal control frameworks, review of the pricing service providers' valuation methodologies, reconciliation to client custodial account values and comparison of significant pricing differences.\nContractual Obligations\nInvestments\nItem 7.\nWe do not believe inflation will significantly affect our compensation costs as they are substantially variable in nature. However, the rate of inflation may affect certain of our other expenses, such as information technology and occupancy costs. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other effects upon the securities markets or general macroeconomic conditions, it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations by impacting overall levels of M&A activity, reducing our AUM or net revenue, or otherwise. See Item 1A, Risk Factors-Other Business Risks-Difficult market conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the volume of the transactions involving our Financial Advisory business and reducing the value or performance of the assets we manage in our Asset Management business, which, in each case, could materially reduce our revenue or income and adversely affect our financial position\u201d.\nThe Company's cash flows are influenced primarily by the timing of the receipt of Financial Advisory and Asset Management fees, the timing of distributions to shareholders, payments of incentive compensation to managing directors and employees and purchases of Class A common stock. Cash flows were also affected: (i) in 2019, by Lazard Group's issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.375% senior notes maturing in 2029 (the 2029 Notes\u201d); (ii) in 2018, by Lazard Group's issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.50% senior notes maturing in 2028 (the 2028 Notes\u201d) and (iii) in 2019 and 2018, the redemption of the 2020 Notes.\n\nRisk Management\n (a) Consists of the following: \n (c) Revenue related to the consolidation of noncontrolling interests is excluded from operating revenue because the Company has no economic interest in such amount. \nCorporate Results of Operations\nAsset Management\nRegulatory Capital\nA significant portion of the Company's indebtedness has fixed interest rates, while its cash and cash equivalents generally have market interest rates. Based on account balances as of December 31, 2019, Lazard estimates that its annual operating income relating to cash and cash equivalents would increase by approximately $12 million in the event interest rates were to increase by 1% and decrease by approximately $12 million if rates were to decrease by 1%.\n (a) See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding business realignment. \nRevenue Recognition\nbusiness development expenses in 2019. The ratio of adjusted non-compensation expense to operating revenue was 19.6% for 2019, as compared to 17.6% in 2018.\nAsset Management\nOperational risk is inherent in all of our businesses and may, for example, manifest itself in the form of errors, breaches in the system of internal controls, employee misconduct, business interruptions, fraud, including fraud perpetrated by third parties, or legal actions due to operating deficiencies or noncompliance. The Company maintains a framework including policies and a system of internal controls designed to monitor and manage operational risk and provide management with timely and accurate information. Management within each of the operating companies is primarily responsible for its operational risk programs. The Company has in place business continuity and disaster recovery programs that manage its capabilities to provide services in the case of a disruption. We purchase insurance policies designed to help protect the Company against accidental loss and losses that may significantly affect our financial objectives, personnel, property or our ability to continue to meet our responsibilities to our various stakeholder groups. See Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d above for more information regarding operational risk in our business.\n (d) Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash consists of cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks and short-term investments and cash deposited with clearing organizations and other segregated cash. \nAsset Management Results of Operations\nBusiness Realignment\nAs long as the lenders' commitments remain in effect, any loan pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement remains outstanding and unpaid or any other amount is due to the lending bank group, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement includes financial covenants that require that Lazard Group not permit (i) its Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) for the 12-month period ending on the last day of any fiscal quarter to be greater than 3.25 to 1.00 or (ii) its Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) for the 12-month period ending on the last day of any fiscal quarter to be less than 3.00 to 1.00. For the 12-month period ended December 31, 2019, Lazard Group was in compliance with such ratios, with its Consolidated Leverage Ratio being 1.84 to 1.00 and its Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio being 12.82 to 1.00. In any event, no amounts were outstanding under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2019.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 versus December 31, 2018\nOn an ongoing basis, regional, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including trade policy and regional tax and regulatory reform, may impact our business. Overall, the global macroeconomic environment remains favorable, equity market fundamentals are strong and credit is widely available.\nAUM primarily consists of debt and equity instruments, which have a value that is readily available based on either prices quoted on a recognized exchange or prices provided by external pricing services.\n\nData relating to investments is set forth below:\nA review of our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2018 appears below. A detailed review of our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 under the caption Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Operating Results\u201d.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company held seed investments of approximately $113 million and $90 million, respectively. Seed investments held in entities in which the Company maintained a controlling interest were $47 million in seven entities as of December 31, 2019, as compared to $31 million in eight entities as of December 31, 2018.\n (e) Composed of investments held in connection with LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements. The market risk associated with such investments is equally offset by the market risk associated with the derivative liability with respect to awards expected to vest. The Company is subject to market risk associated with any portion of such investments that employees may forfeit. See -Risk Management-Risks Related to Derivatives\u201d for risk management information relating to derivatives. LFI investments held in entities in which the Company maintained a controlling interest were $93 million in eight entities as of December 31, 2019, as compared to $69 million in three entities as of December 31, 2018. \nAmended and Restated Tax Receivable Agreement\nThe geographical distribution of Financial Advisory net revenue is set forth below in percentage terms and is based on the Lazard offices that generate Financial Advisory net revenue, which are located in the Americas (primarily in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America), EMEA (primarily in the U.K., France, Germany, Italy and Spain) and the Asia Pacific region (primarily in Australia) and therefore may not be reflective of the geography in which the clients are located.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide coverage for probable losses from our receivables. We determine the adequacy of the allowance by estimating the probability of loss based on our analysis of the client's creditworthiness, among other things, and specifically provide for exposures where we determine the receivables are impaired. At December 31, 2019, total receivables amounted to $663 million, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $27 million. As of that date, Financial Advisory and Asset Management fees, and customers and other receivables comprised 81% and 19% of total receivables, respectively. At December 31, 2018, total receivables amounted to $686 million, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $40 million. As of that date, Financial Advisory and Asset Management fees, and customers and other receivables comprised 73% and 27% of total receivables, respectively. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had receivables past due or deemed uncollectible of approximately $43 million and $42 million, respectively. See also Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Revenue Recognition\u201d above and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding receivables.\nWe record tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return based upon our estimates regarding the amount that is more likely than not to be realized or paid, including in connection with the resolution of any related appeals or other legal processes. Accordingly, we recognize liabilities for certain unrecognized tax benefits based on the amounts that are more likely than not to be settled with the relevant taxing authority. Such liabilities are evaluated periodically as new information becomes available and any changes in the amounts of such liabilities are recorded as adjustments to income tax expense.\u201d Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits involve significant judgment and the ultimate resolution of such matters may be materially different from our estimates.\n (c) Consists primarily of purchases of shares of Class A common stock, tax withholdings related to the settlement of vested RSUs, vested restricted stock awards and vested PRSUs, Class A common stock dividends, changes in customer deposits, distributions to noncontrolling interest holders, and activity relating to borrowings (including, in 2019 and 2018, the redemption of the 2020 Notes and the issuance of the 2029 and 2028 Notes, respectively). \nBusiness Environment and Outlook\nAsset Management operating income was $350 million, a decrease of $70 million, or 17%, as compared to operating income of $420 million in 2018 and, as a percentage of net revenue, was 28.3%, as compared to 31.5% in 2018.\nFor additional information regarding risks associated with our investments, see Risk Management-Investments\u201d below as well as Item 1A, Risk Factors-Other Business Risks-Our results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the fair value of positions held in our investment portfolios\u201d.\nThe provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of 24.2%, as compared to 21.8% in 2018. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Critical Accounting Policies-Income Taxes\u201d below.\nWe also invest our own capital from time to time, generally alongside capital of qualified institutional and individual investors in alternative investments or private equity investments, and, since 2005, we have engaged in a number of alternative investments and private equity activities, including, historically, investments through (i)\nAmortization and other acquisition-related (benefits) costs reflect a cost of $19 million in the 2019 period, as compared to a benefit of $16 million in the 2018 period, primarily due to the change in the fair market value of contingent consideration.\n \u2022 the Company has satisfied the applicable performance obligation. \nLazard is subject to market and credit risk on investments held. As such, gains and losses on investment positions held, which arise from sales or changes in the fair value of the investments, are not predictable and can cause periodic fluctuations in net income.\nSummary of Cash Flows:\nRisks Related to Derivatives\n \u2022 we deduct amortization expense recorded for accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) purposes in the fiscal year associated with deferred incentive compensation awards; \nIncome Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted. The Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax system by, among other changes, lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, implementing a partial territorial tax system and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on the deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Act also included several provisions that limited the benefit of the tax rate reduction, such as restricting the deductibility of interest expense and other corporate business expenses. The Tax Act further included anti-base erosion provisions such as the BEAT and tax on GILTI and in 2019, the IRS issued broad and complex final and proposed regulations interpreting such provisions of the Tax Act.\n \u2022 future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards; \nFor private equity funds, incentive fees may be earned in the form of a carried interest\u201d if profits arising from realized investments exceed a specified threshold. Typically, such carried interest is ultimately calculated on a whole-fund basis and, therefore, clawback of carried interest during the life of the fund can occur. As a result, incentive fees earned on our private equity funds are not recognized until potential uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizable amounts have been determined, including any potential for clawback.", "item_7_text": " \u2022 Financial Advisory-The fundamentals for continued M&A activity and recent trends such as technological disruption and shareholder activism, which can be a catalyst for global strategic activity, appear to remain in place. We believe our Financial Advisory business is in a strong competitive position as demand continues for expert, independent strategic advice that can be levered across geographies and our range of capabilities. The global scale and breadth of our Financial Advisory business allows us to advise on a wide range of strategic and restructuring transactions across a variety of industries. In addition, we believe our businesses throughout North America, Europe and the emerging markets position us for growth in these markets, while enhancing our relationships with, and the services that we can provide to, clients in other economies. We continue to invest in our Financial Advisory business by selectively hiring talented senior professionals and continuing to focus on our M&A and other advisory services. \nDuring September 2018, Lazard Group completed an offering of the 2028 Notes. Lazard Group used a portion of the net proceeds of the 2028 Notes to redeem or otherwise retire $250 million of the 2020 Notes.\nLazard's involvement with various entities that are VOEs or VIEs primarily arises from LFI investments and investment management contracts with fund entities in our Asset Management business. Lazard is not required to consolidate such entities because, with the exception of certain seed and LFI investments, as discussed below, we do not hold more than an inconsequential equity interest in such entities and we do not hold other variable interests (including our investment management agreements, which do not meet the definition of variable interests) in such entities.\nAssets Under Management\nIn accordance with current accounting guidance, goodwill has an indefinite life and is tested for impairment annually, as of November 1, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The Company performs a qualitative evaluation about whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount in lieu of actually calculating the fair value of the reporting unit. The goodwill impairment test as of November 1, 2019 indicated that no reporting units were at risk of impairment. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding goodwill.\n \u2022 historical experience with tax attributes expiring unused; and \nThe Company earns performance-based incentive fees on various investment products, including traditional products and alternative investment funds such as hedge funds and private equity funds. See Financial Statement Overview\u201d for a description of our revenue recognition policies on such fees.\nFinancing Activities\nNoncontrolling interests primarily consist of amounts related to Edgewater's management vehicles that the Company is deemed to control but not own, profits interest participation rights and consolidated VIE interests held by employees. See Notes 15 and 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company's noncontrolling interests and consolidated VIEs.\n\nEdgewater, our Chicago-based private equity firm and (ii) a fund targeting significant noncontrolling-stake investments in established private companies. We also make investments to seed our Asset Management strategies.\nCorporate\nEquity Market Price Risk-At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company's exposure to equity market price risk in its investment portfolio, which primarily relates to investments in equity securities, equity funds and hedge funds, was approximately $85 million and $84 million, respectively. The Company hedges market exposure arising from a significant portion of our equity investment portfolios by entering into total return swaps. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a net decrease of approximately $1.0 million and $0.8 million in the carrying value of such investments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, including the effect of the hedging transactions.\n (b) Unfunded commitments to private equity investments consolidated but not owned by Lazard of $11,155 are excluded. Such commitments are required to be funded by capital contributions from noncontrolling interest holders. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These amounts are generally due on demand and therefore are presented in the less than 1 year\u201d category. \n\nInterest Rate/Credit Spread Risk-At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company's exposure to interest rate and credit spread risk in its investment portfolio related to investments in debt securities or funds which invest primarily in debt securities was $153 million and $245 million, respectively. The Company hedges market exposure arising from a portion of our debt investment portfolios by entering into total return swaps. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse change in interest rates or credit spreads would result in a decrease of approximately $1.0 million and $0.9 million in the carrying value of such investments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, including the effect of the hedging transactions.\nThe Company has investments in a variety of asset classes, primarily debt and equity securities, and interests in alternative investments, debt, equity and private equity funds. The Company makes investments primarily to seed strategies in our Asset Management business or to reduce exposure arising from LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements. The Company measures its net economic exposure to market and other risks arising from investments that it owns, excluding (i) investments held in connection with LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements, (ii) investments in funds owned entirely by the noncontrolling interest holders of certain acquired entities and (iii) interest-bearing deposits with maturities over 90 days that allow daily withdrawals without principal penalties.\nOn October 31, 2019, Lazard Group distributed to its managing members, which are subsidiaries of Lazard Ltd, 17,000,000 shares of Class A common stock that were held by Lazard Group. These shares were ultimately received by Lazard Ltd and cancelled. There was no impact on total stockholders' equity as a result of the share cancellation.\nCertain Lazard fee and transaction statistics for the Financial Advisory segment are set forth below:\nCompensation and benefits expense is the largest component of our operating expenses. We seek to maintain discipline with respect to compensation, including the rate at which we award deferred compensation. Our goal is to maintain a ratio of awarded compensation and benefits expense to operating revenue and a ratio of adjusted compensation and benefits expense to operating revenue over the cycle in the mid- to high-50s percentage range. While we have implemented policies and initiatives that we believe will assist us in maintaining ratios within this range, there can be no guarantee that we will continue to maintain such ratios, or that our policies or initiatives will not change in the future. We may benefit from pressure on compensation costs within the financial services industry in future periods; however, increased competition for senior professionals, changes in the macroeconomic environment or the financial markets generally, lower operating revenue resulting from, for example, a decrease in M&A activity, our share of the M&A market or our AUM levels, changes in the mix of revenues from our businesses, investments in our businesses or various other factors could prevent us from achieving this goal.\nNet interest expense increased $20 million, or 45%, as compared to 2018 due to an increase in senior debt outstanding in 2019.\nThe percentage change in major equity market indices (i) at December 31, 2019, as compared to such indices at December 31, 2018, and (ii) at December 31, 2018, as compared to such indices at December 31, 2017, is shown in the table below.\n (f) Represents expenses associated with an unconditional commitment to the Lazard Foundation. \nWe believe that awarded compensation and benefits expense\u201d and the ratio of awarded compensation and benefits expense\u201d to operating revenue,\u201d both non-GAAP measures, are the most appropriate measures to assess the annual cost of compensation and provide the most meaningful basis for comparison of compensation and benefits expense between present, historical and future years. Awarded compensation and benefits expense\u201d for a given year is calculated using adjusted compensation and benefits expense,\u201d also a non-GAAP measure, as modified by the following items:\n \u2022 a contract with a client has been identified; \nHeadcount information is set forth below:\n (c) Represents expenses associated with the Enterprise Resource Planning ( ERP\u201d) system implementation. \n \u2022 duration of statutory carryforward periods; \n\nWe recognize a deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of greater than 50%) that a tax benefit will be accepted by a taxing authority. The measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based upon currently enacted tax rates in the applicable jurisdictions. At December 31, 2019, on a consolidated basis, we recorded gross deferred tax assets of approximately $737 million, with such amount partially offset by a valuation allowance of approximately $76 million (as described below).\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company's cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $1,232 million. Substantially all of the Company's cash and cash equivalents were invested in (i) highly liquid institutional money market funds (a significant majority of which were invested solely in U.S. Government or agency money market funds), (ii) short-term interest bearing and non-interest bearing accounts at a number of leading banks throughout the world, (iii) short-term certificates of deposit from such banks and (iv) short-term U.S. Treasury securities. Cash and cash equivalents are constantly monitored. On a regular basis, management reviews its investment profile as well as the credit profile of its list of depositor banks in order to adjust any deposit or investment thresholds as necessary.\nLazard's annual cash flow generated from operations historically has been sufficient to enable it to meet its annual obligations. We believe that our cash flows from operating activities, along with the use of our credit lines as needed, should be sufficient for us to fund our current obligations for the next 12 months.\nTo reduce the exposure to concentrations of credit, the Company monitors large exposures to individual counterparties.\n (b) Source: Dealogic as of January 3, 2020. \nGoodwill\nRisk sensitivities include the effects of economic hedging. For equity market price risk, investment portfolios and their corresponding hedges are beta-adjusted to the All-Country World equity index. Fair value and sensitivity measurements presented herein are based on various portfolio exposures at a particular point in time and may not be representative of future results. Risk exposures may change as a result of ongoing portfolio activities and changing market conditions, among other things.\nOur outlook with respect to our Financial Advisory and Asset Management businesses is described below.\nwhen payment is not received by the agreed-upon contractual date or the court approval date, respectively. Financial Advisory fee receivables past due in excess of 180 days are fully provided for unless there is evidence that the balance is collectible. Asset Management fees are deemed past due and fully provided for when such receivables are outstanding 12 months after the invoice date. Notwithstanding our policy for receivables past due, we specifically reserve against exposures relating to Financial Advisory and Asset Management fees where we determine receivables are impaired.\nOur consolidated net revenue was derived from the following segments:\nOur top ten clients accounted for 28%, 26% and 25% of our total AUM at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and no individual client constituted more than 10% of our Asset Management segment net revenue during any of the respective years.\n (b) Private equity investments include investments related to certain legacy businesses and co-investments in private equity funds managed by our Asset Management business. Co-investments owned were $20 million and $27 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. \n\n (c) The table above excludes contingent obligations, given the inability to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of the amounts of any such payments. The table above also excludes any possible payments for uncertain tax positions and payments pursuant to the Company's tax receivable agreement, given that the actual amount and timing of payments under the tax receivable agreement could differ materially from our estimates. At December 31, 2019, a tax receivable agreement obligation of $247,344 was recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition, of which the Company currently expects that approximately $25,000 will be paid within the next 12 months. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Income Taxes\u201d below. See also Notes 14, 16, 17, 19 and 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding information in connection with commitments, incentive plans, employee benefit plans, income taxes and tax receivable agreement obligations, respectively. \n</td> </tr>\n \u2022 near-term and medium-term financial outlook. \nLazard generates substantially all of its net revenue from providing Financial Advisory and Asset Management services to clients. Lazard recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met:\nLazard's consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars. Many of our non-U.S. subsidiaries have a functional currency (i.e., the currency in which operational activities are primarily conducted) that is other than the U.S. Dollar, generally the currency of the country in which the subsidiaries are domiciled. Such subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars using exchange rates as of the respective balance sheet date, while revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the respective periods based on the daily closing exchange rates. Adjustments that result from translating amounts from a subsidiary's functional currency are reported as a component of stockholders' equity. Foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on transactions in non-functional currencies are included in the consolidated statements of operations.\nCash Flows\n (c) Represents certain distribution fees, reimbursable deal costs paid to third parties and bad debt expense relating to fees that are deemed uncollectible for which an equal amount is included for purposes of determining operating revenue. \nPrices of equity and debt securities and other instruments that comprise our AUM are provided by well-recognized, independent, third-party vendors. Such third-party vendors rely on prices provided by external pricing services which are obtained from recognized exchanges or markets, or, for certain fixed income securities, from an evaluated bid or other similarly sourced price.\nNon-compensation expense decreased $41 million, or 6%, as compared to 2018, primarily due to higher bad debt expense in 2018 and lower fund administration fees in 2019, partially offset by investments in technology infrastructure and increased business development expenses in 2019. Adjusted non-compensation expense increased $14 million, or 3%, as compared to 2018, primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure and increased\nIn addition, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, indenture and supplemental indentures relating to Lazard Group's senior notes contain certain other covenants (none of which relate to financial condition), events of default and other customary provisions. At December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all of these provisions. We may, to the extent required and subject to restrictions contained in our financing arrangements, use other financing sources, which may cause us to be subject to additional restrictions or covenants.\nNet revenue, operating income and cash receipts fluctuate significantly between periods. In the case of Financial Advisory, fee receipts are generally dependent upon the successful completion of client transactions, the occurrence and timing of which is irregular and not subject to Lazard's control.\n (g) An estimate, based on historical experience and future expectations, for future forfeitures of the deferred portion of such awards in order to present awarded compensation and benefits expense on a similar basis to that under U.S. GAAP, which also considers estimated forfeitures. \nAs of December 31, 2019 approximately 86% of our AUM was managed on behalf of institutional clients, including corporations, labor unions, public pension funds, insurance companies and banks, and through sub-advisory relationships, mutual fund sponsors, broker-dealers and registered advisors as compared to approximately 88% as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 14% of our AUM was managed on behalf of individual client relationships, which are principally with family offices and individuals, as compared to approximately 12% as of December 31, 2018.\nThe Board of Directors of Lazard has issued a series of authorizations to repurchase Class A common stock, which help offset the dilutive effect of our share-based incentive compensation plans. During a given year the Company intends to repurchase at least as many shares as it expects to ultimately issue pursuant to such compensation plans in respect of year-end incentive compensation attributable to the prior year. The rate at which the Company purchases shares in connection with this annual objective may vary from period to period due to a variety of factors. Purchases with respect to such program are set forth in the table below:\nAs reflected in the following table, which sets forth global M&A industry statistics, the value and number of all completed transactions, including the subset of completed transactions involving values greater than $500 million, decreased in 2019 as compared to 2018. With respect to announced M&A transactions, the value and number of all transactions, including the subset of announced transactions involving values greater than $500 million, are flat as compared to 2018, apart from the number of announced transactions involving values greater than $500 million, which decreased in 2019 as compared to 2018.\nGlobal restructuring activity during 2019, as measured by the number of corporate defaults, increased as compared to 2018. The number of defaulting issuers increased to 101 in 2019, according to Moody's Investors Service, Inc., as compared to 79 in 2018.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with Lazard Ltd's consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this Form 10-K\u201d). This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ significantly from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those set forth in the sections entitled Risk Factors\u201d and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nWe operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge continuously, and it is not possible for our management to predict all risks and uncertainties, nor can we assess the impact of all potentially applicable factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. See Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K. Furthermore, net income and revenue in any period may not be indicative of full-year results or the results of any other period and may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter.\nNet Revenue\nLazard is one of the world's preeminent financial advisory and asset management firms. We have long specialized in crafting solutions to the complex financial and strategic challenges of a diverse set of clients around the world, including corporations, governments, institutions, partnerships and individuals. Founded in 1848 in New Orleans, we currently operate from more than 40 cities and 25 countries across key business and financial centers in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and Central and South America.\nOur primary business purpose is to serve our clients. Our deep roots in business centers around the world form a global network of relationships with key decision-makers in corporations, governments and investing institutions. This network is both a competitive strength and a powerful resource for Lazard and our clients. As a firm that competes on the quality of our advice, we have two fundamental assets: our people and our reputation.\n \u2022 the fee or other transaction price has been determined; \n (a) Interest expense (excluding interest expense incurred by LFB) is added back in determining operating revenue because such expense relates to corporate financing activities and is not considered to be a cost directly related to the revenue of our business. \nOn January 29, 2020, the Board of Directors of Lazard declared a quarterly dividend of $0.47 per share on our Class A common stock. The dividend is payable on February 28, 2020, to stockholders of record on February 18, 2020.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\n\nAt December 31, 2019, total stockholders' equity was $682 million, as compared to $970 million and $1,259 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, including $610 million, $917 million and $1,200 million attributable to Lazard Ltd on the respective dates. The net activity in stockholders' equity during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 is reflected in the table below:\n \u2022 tax-planning strategies. \nCompensation and benefits expense, which included $57 million associated with business realignment in 2019, increased $49 million, or 3%, as compared to 2018.\n\nOperating income decreased $288 million, or 42%, as compared to 2018.\nThe cumulative liability relating to our obligations under the Amended and Restated Tax Receivable Agreement recorded as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $247 million and $271 million, respectively, and is recorded in tax receivable agreement obligation\u201d on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\n\nOperating Expenses\nAsset Management net revenue decreased $94 million, or 7%, as compared to 2018. Management fees and other revenue was $1,216 million, a decrease of $95 million, or 7%, as compared to $1,311 million in 2018, primarily due to a decrease in average AUM and change in asset mix. Incentive fees were unchanged as compared to 2018.\n (i) the deferred incentive compensation awards granted in the year-end compensation process with respect to the fiscal year (e.g., deferred incentive compensation awards granted in 2020 related to the 2019 year-end compensation process), including performance-based restricted stock unit ( PRSU\u201d) and performance-based restricted participation unit ( PRPU\u201d) awards (based on the target payout level); \naccount all available information, we cannot determine that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets held by these entities will be realized. Consequently, we have recorded valuation allowances on $76 million of deferred tax assets held by these entities as of December 31, 2019.\nThe following is a summary of changes in AUM by asset class for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nThe majority of Lazard's Financial Advisory net revenue historically has been earned from the successful completion of M&A transactions, capital advisory services, capital raising, restructuring, shareholder advisory, sovereign advisory and other strategic advisory matters. The main drivers of Financial Advisory net revenue are overall M&A activity, the level of corporate debt defaults and the environment for capital raising activities, particularly in the industries and geographic markets in which Lazard focuses. In some client engagements, often those involving financially distressed companies, revenue is earned in the form of retainers and similar fees that are contractually agreed upon with each client for each assignment and are not necessarily linked to the completion of a transaction. In addition, Lazard also earns fees from providing strategic advice to clients, with such fees not being dependent on a specific transaction, and may also earn fees in connection with public and private securities offerings. Significant fluctuations in Financial Advisory net revenue can occur over the course of any given year, because a significant portion of such net revenue is earned upon the successful completion of a transaction, restructuring or capital raising activity, the timing of which is uncertain and is not subject to Lazard's control.\n (ii) the portion of investments in people (e.g., sign-on\u201d bonuses or retention awards) and other special deferred incentive compensation awards that is applicable to the fiscal year the award becomes effective; and \nFinancial Advisory\nThe table below sets forth our corporate indebtedness as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The agreements with respect to this indebtedness are discussed in more detail in our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nThe following table summarizes the reported operating results attributable to the Financial Advisory segment:\n (a) See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding business realignment. \n (a) See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding business realignment. \n \u2022 future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; \nPrivate Equity-The Company invests in private equity primarily as a part of its co-investment activities and in connection with certain legacy businesses. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company's exposure to changes in fair value of such investments was approximately $24 million and $42 million, respectively. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in fair value would result in a decrease of approximately $2.4 million and $4.2 million in the carrying value of such investments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nEconomic and global financial market conditions can materially affect our financial performance. As described above, our principal sources of revenue are derived from activities in our Financial Advisory and Asset Management business segments. As our Financial Advisory revenues are primarily dependent on the successful completion of merger, acquisition, restructuring, capital raising or similar transactions, and our Asset Management revenues are primarily driven by the levels of assets under management, weak economic and global financial market conditions can result in a challenging business environment for M&A and capital-raising activity as well as our Asset Management business, but may provide opportunities for our restructuring business.\nFor a discussion of recently issued accounting developments and their impact or potential impact on Lazard's consolidated financial statements, see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn addition to the discussion above regarding deferred tax assets and associated valuation allowances, as well as unrecognized tax benefit liability estimates, other factors affect our provision for income taxes, including changes in the geographic mix of our business, the level of our annual pre-tax income, transfer pricing and intercompany transactions.\nAdjusted compensation and benefits expense was $1,464 million, a decrease of $53 million, or 3%, as compared to $1,517 million in 2018. The ratio of adjusted compensation and benefits expense to operating revenue was 57.5% for 2019, as compared to 55.1% for 2018. Awarded compensation and benefits expense in 2019 was $1,469 million, a decrease of $68 million, or 4%, when compared to $1,537 million in 2018. The ratio of awarded compensation and benefits expense to operating revenue was 57.7%, as compared to 55.8% for 2018. The year-end deferred incentive compensation awarded for 2019 was $361 million, representing a decrease of $17 million, or 4%, as compared to 2018. As described above, when analyzing compensation and benefits expense on a full-year basis, we believe that awarded compensation and benefits expense provides the most meaningful basis for comparison of compensation and benefits expense between present, historical and future years.\nBusiness Summary\nAs of December 31, 2019, a total of $401 million of share repurchase authorization remained available under the Company's share repurchase program, $101 million of which will expire on December 31, 2020 and $300 million of which will expire on December 31, 2021.\nM&A and other advisory and Asset Management fees are generally collected within 60 days of billing, while Restructuring fee collections may extend beyond 60 days, particularly those that involve bankruptcies with court-ordered holdbacks. Fees from our Private Capital Advisory activities are generally collected over a four-year period from billing and typically include an interest component.\nGenerally, when the Company initially invests to seed an investment entity, the Company is the majority owner of the entity. Our majority ownership in seed investment entities represents a controlling interest, except when we are the general partner in such entities and the third-party investors have the right to replace the general partner. To the extent material, we consolidate seed and LFI investment entities in which we own a controlling interest, and we would deconsolidate any such entity when we no longer have a controlling interest in such entity.\nFor hedge funds, incentive fees are calculated based on a specified percentage of a fund's net appreciation, in some cases in excess of established benchmarks or thresholds. The Company records incentive fees on traditional products and hedge funds at the end of the relevant performance measurement period, when potential uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizable amounts have been determined. The incentive fee measurement period is generally an annual period (unless an account terminates or redemption occurs during the year). The incentive fees received at the end of the measurement period are not subject to reversal or payback. Incentive fees on hedge funds are often subject to loss carryforward provisions in which losses incurred by the hedge funds in any year are applied against certain gains realized by the hedge funds in future periods before any incentive fees can be earned.\n (e) Represents write-down of a private equity investment to the potential transaction value. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\n\nAverage AUM for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 for each significant asset class is set forth below. Average AUM generally represents the average of the monthly ending AUM balances for the period.\n \u2022 taxable income in prior carryback years; and \nFinancial Advisory Results of Operations\nLiquidity is also affected by the level of deposits and other customer payables, principally at LFB. To the extent that such deposits and other customer payables rise or fall, this has a corresponding impact on liquidity held at LFB, with the majority of such amounts generally being recorded in deposits with banks and short-term investments\u201d. In the year ended December 31, 2019, as reflected on the consolidated statements of financial condition, both deposits with banks and short-term investments\u201d and deposits and other customer payables\u201d increased as compared to December 31, 2018, due to a higher level of LFB customer-related demand deposits, primarily from clients and funds managed by LFG.\nWe believe that adjusted non-compensation expense\u201d, a non-GAAP measure, provides a more meaningful basis for our investors to assess our operating results. For calculations with respect to adjusted non-compensation expense\u201d, see the table under Consolidated Results of Operations\u201d below.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n (d) Represents private equity investments that are consolidated but owned by noncontrolling interests, and therefore do not subject the Company to market or credit risk. The applicable noncontrolling interests are presented within stockholders' equity\u201d on the consolidated statements of financial condition. \nThe Company also records derivative liabilities relating to its obligations pertaining to LFI awards and other similar deferred compensation arrangements, the fair value of which is based on the value of the underlying investments, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. Changes in the fair value of the derivative liabilities are equally offset by the changes in the fair value of investments which are expected to be delivered upon settlement of LFI awards. Derivative liabilities relating to LFI amounted to $226 million and $188 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of Lazard's consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, Lazard evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, income taxes (including the impact on the tax receivable agreement obligation), investing activities and goodwill. Lazard bases these estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments, including judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities, that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $6 million as compared to 2018.\nThe weight we give to any particular item is, in part, dependent upon the degree to which it can be objectively verified. We give greater weight to the recent results of operations of a relevant entity. Pre-tax operating losses on a three year cumulative basis or lack of sustainable profitability are considered objectively verifiable evidence and will generally outweigh a projection of future taxable income.\n (f) Represents special deferred incentive awards that are granted outside the year-end compensation process, and includes grants to new hires, retention awards and performance units earned under PRSU grants. \nLiquidity is significantly impacted by cash payments for, or in respect of, incentive compensation, a significant portion of which are made during the first three months of the year. As a consequence, cash on hand generally declines in the beginning of the year and gradually builds over the remainder of the year. We also pay certain tax advances during the year on behalf of certain managing directors, which serve to reduce their respective incentive compensation payments. We expect this seasonal pattern of cash flow to continue.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Lazard Group and entities in which it has a controlling interest. Lazard determines whether it has a controlling interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity ( VOE\u201d) or a variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d) under U.S. GAAP.\nOperating expenses, which included $16 million associated with business realignment in 2019, decreased $25 million, or 3%, as compared to 2018, primarily due to a decrease in compensation and benefits expense associated with decreased operating revenue as well as lower fund administration fees.\nThe following table shows the composition of AUM for the Asset Management segment (see Item 1, Business-Principal Business Lines-Asset Management-Investment Strategies\u201d):\nSee Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Income Taxes\u201d below and Notes 19 and 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes, the impact of the Tax Act on us, our deferred tax assets and the tax receivable agreement obligation.\nLazard Ltd, through its subsidiaries, is subject to U.S. federal income taxes on all of its U.S. operating income, as well as on the portion of non-U.S. income attributable to its U.S. subsidiaries. In addition, Lazard Ltd, through its subsidiaries, is subject to state and local taxes on its income apportioned to various state and local jurisdictions. Outside the U.S., Lazard Group operates principally through subsidiary corporations that are subject to local income taxes in foreign jurisdictions. Lazard Group is also subject to Unincorporated Business Tax ( UBT\u201d) attributable to its operations apportioned to New York City.\n \u2022 Asset Management-In the short to intermediate term, we expect most investor demand will come through financial institutions, and from defined benefit and defined contribution plans in developed economies because of their sheer scope and size. Over the longer term, and depending upon local market conditions, we would expect an increasing share of our AUM to come from the developing economies around the globe, as their retirement systems evolve and individual wealth is increasingly deployed in the financial markets. Given our diversified investment platform and our ability to provide investment solutions for a global mix of clients, we believe we are positioned to benefit from opportunities across the asset management industry. We are continually developing and seeding new investment strategies that extend our existing platforms and assessing potential product acquisitions or other inorganic growth opportunities. Recent examples of growth initiatives include the following investment strategies: various Quantitative Equity strategies, explainable AI capabilities, a U.S. Systematic Equity strategy, and sustainable investment strategies. \nassumptions regarding potential future operating profitability. The assumptions reflected in the estimate involve significant judgment, and if our structure were to change or our annual taxable income were to increase, we could be required to accelerate payments under the Amended and Restated Tax Receivable Agreement. As such, the actual amount and timing of payments under the Amended and Restated Tax Receivable Agreement could differ materially from our estimates. Any changes in the amount of the estimated liability would be recorded as a non-compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations. Adjustments, if necessary, to the related deferred tax assets would be recorded through income tax expense.\n\nTotal AUM at December 31, 2019 was $248 billion, an increase of $33 billion, or 16%, as compared to total AUM of $215 billion at December 31, 2018, due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows and foreign exchange depreciation. Average AUM for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $7 billion, or 3%, as compared to 2018.\nDuring the period ended June 30, 2015, we released substantially all of our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. As a result, we accrued a corresponding liability during the period ended June 30, 2015 for amounts relating to the Second Amended and Restated Tax Receivable Agreement, dated as of October 26, 2015 (the Amended and Restated Tax Receivable Agreement\u201d), between Lazard and LTBP Trust (the Trust\u201d). See Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Amended and Restated Tax Receivable Agreement.\n\n (e) Deferred incentive compensation awards applicable to the relevant year-end compensation process (e.g., deferred incentive compensation awards granted in 2020, 2019 and 2018 related to the 2019, 2018 and 2017 year-end compensation processes, respectively). \nWe actively monitor our regulatory capital base. Our principal subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements in their respective jurisdictions to ensure their general financial soundness and liquidity, which require, among other things, that we comply with rules regarding certain minimum capital requirements, record-keeping, reporting procedures, relationships with customers, experience and training requirements for employees and certain other requirements and procedures. These regulatory requirements may restrict the flow of funds to and from affiliates. See Note 22 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. These regulations differ in the U.S., the U.K., France and other countries in which we operate. Our capital structure is designed to provide each of our subsidiaries with capital and liquidity consistent with its business and regulatory requirements. For a discussion of regulations relating to us, see Item 1, Business-Regulation\u201d included in this Form 10-K.\nOverall, we continue to focus on the development of our business, including the generation of stable revenue growth, earnings growth and shareholder returns, the evaluation of potential growth opportunities, the investment in new technology to support the development of existing and new business opportunities, the prudent management of our costs and expenses, the efficient use of our assets and the return of capital to our shareholders.\n</table>\nWith respect to fees receivable from Financial Advisory activities, such receivables are generally deemed past due when they are outstanding 60 days from the date of invoice. However, some Financial Advisory transactions include specific contractual payment terms that may vary from one month to four years (as is the case for our Private Capital Advisory fees) following the invoice date or may be subject to court approval (as is the case with restructuring assignments that include bankruptcy proceedings). In such cases, receivables are deemed past due\nThe amount of the Amended and Restated Tax Receivable Agreement liability is an undiscounted amount based upon currently enacted tax laws, including the Tax Act, the current structure of the Company and various\n (a) During March 2019, Lazard Group completed an offering of $500,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes. Interest on the 2029 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 11 and September 11 of each year, beginning September 11, 2019. Lazard Group used a portion of the net proceeds of the 2029 Notes during March and April 2019 to redeem or otherwise retire the remaining $250,000 of the 2020 Notes. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nThe geographical distribution of Asset Management net revenue is set forth below in percentage terms, and is based on the Lazard offices that manage and distribute the respective AUM amounts. Such geographical distribution may not be reflective of the geography of the investment products or clients.\n (e) Expenses related to the consolidation of noncontrolling interests are excluded because the Company has no economic interest in such amounts. \nYear Ended December 31, 2019 versus December 31, 2018\nFinancial Advisory\nIf, in Lazard's judgment, collection of a fee is not probable, Lazard will not recognize revenue until the uncertainty is removed. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide coverage for estimated losses from our receivables. We determine the adequacy of the allowance by estimating the probability of loss based on our analysis of the client's creditworthiness and specifically reserve against exposures where we determine the receivables are impaired, which may include situations where a fee is in dispute or litigation has commenced.\nAlthough Corporate segment net revenue during 2019 is not significant compared to Lazard's net revenue, total assets in the Corporate segment represented 65% of Lazard's consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2019, which are attributable to cash and cash equivalents, investments in debt and equity securities, interests in alternative investment, debt, equity and private equity funds, deferred tax assets and certain assets associated with LFB.\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Selected financial data derived from the Company's reported consolidated results of operations is set forth below, followed by a more detailed discussion of both the consolidated and business segment results.\nOur operating expenses also include our benefit pursuant to the tax receivable agreement\u201d (which, in 2017, was offset by the charges described below relating to the Tax Act) and amortization and other acquisition-related (benefits) costs\u201d, which includes the change in fair value of the contingent consideration associated with business acquisitions.\nWe conducted a review of our business, which resulted in a realignment that included employee reductions and the closing of subscale offices and investment strategies, most of which were completed during the third quarter of 2019. We believe these actions better align the business with changes in the marketplace and create greater flexibility to focus on strategic growth opportunities. These actions resulted in expenses of $68 million in 2019. See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe Company reported net income attributable to Lazard Ltd of $287 million, as compared to net income attributable to Lazard Ltd of $527 million in 2018.\nLazard makes seed and LFI investments in certain entities that are considered VOEs and VIEs and often require consolidation as a result of our investment. The impact of seed and LFI investment entities that require consolidation on the consolidated financial statements, including any consolidation or deconsolidation of such entities, is not material to our financial statements. Our exposure to loss from entities in which we have made such investments is limited to the extent of our investment in, or investment commitment to, such entities. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Investments\u201d above for more information regarding our investments.\nOperational Risk\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company did not consolidate or deconsolidate any seed investment entities or LFI investment entities, with the exception of the recent consolidation of certain LFI funds (see Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). As such, 100% of the recorded balance of seed investments and substantially all of LFI investments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 represented the Company's economic interest in the seed and LFI investments. See -Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities\u201d below for more information on the Company's policy regarding the consolidation of seed and LFI investment entities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company had in place trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, pursuant to which it effected stock repurchases in the open market.\nDuring March 2019, Lazard Group completed an offering of the 2029 Notes. Lazard Group used a portion of the net proceeds of the 2029 Notes to redeem or otherwise retire the remaining 2020 Notes in transactions that occurred during March 2019 and April 2019.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nThe Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains customary terms and conditions, including limitations on consolidations, mergers, indebtedness and certain payments, as well as financial condition covenants relating to leverage and interest coverage ratios. Lazard Group's obligations under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement may be accelerated upon customary events of default, including non-payment of principal or interest, breaches of covenants, cross-defaults to other material debt, a change in control and specified bankruptcy events.\n \u2022 Variable Interest Entities. VIEs are entities that lack one or more of the characteristics of a VOE. If Lazard has a variable interest, or a combination of variable interests, in a VIE, it is required to analyze whether it needs to consolidate such VIE. Lazard is required to consolidate a VIE if we are the primary beneficiary having (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of, or receive benefits from, the VIE that could be potentially significant to the VIE. \nA portion of our net revenue is derived from transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was negatively impacted, and net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was positively impacted, by exchange rate movements, in each case in comparison to the relevant prior year period. The majority of the impact to net revenue, in both periods, was offset by the impact of the exchange rate movements on our operating expenses during the years denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.\n\n\n (b) Represents incremental rent expense and lease abandonment costs related to office space reorganization. \nCertain of our tax-paying entities have individually experienced losses on a cumulative three year basis or have tax attributes that may expire unused. In addition, one of our tax-paying entities has recorded a valuation allowance on substantially all of its deferred tax assets due to the combined effect of operating losses in certain subsidiaries of that entity as well as foreign taxes that together substantially offset any U.S. tax liability. Taking into\n (a) The tax withholding portion of share-based compensation is settled in cash, not shares. \n (b) Represents certain distribution fees, reimbursable deal costs paid to third parties and bad debt expense relating to fees that are deemed uncollectible for which an equal amount is excluded for purposes of determining adjusted non-compensation expense. \nYear Ended December 31, 2019 versus December 31, 2018\nCorporate segment net revenue consists primarily of investment gains and losses on the Company's seed investments\u201d related to our Asset Management business and principal investments in private equity funds, net of hedging activities, as well as gains and losses on investments held in connection with Lazard Fund Interests ( LFI\u201d) and interest income and interest expense. Corporate net revenue also can fluctuate due to changes in the fair value of debt and equity securities, as well as due to changes in interest and currency exchange rates and in the levels of cash, investments and indebtedness.\nBusiness Segments\n (a) Includes the impact of business realignment as of December 31, 2019. \nInvestments\nThe assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted also considers all available information, including the following:\nInflows in the Equity asset class were primarily attributable to the Global, Local and Multi-Regional platforms, and inflows in the Fixed Income asset class were primarily attributable to the Global, Multi-Regional and Emerging Markets platforms. Outflows in the Equity asset class were primarily attributable to the Emerging Markets, Global and Multi-Regional equity platforms, and outflows in the Fixed Income asset class were primarily attributable to the Emerging Markets and Global platforms.\nThe Company makes cash payments for, or in respect of, a significant portion of its incentive compensation during the first three months of each calendar year with respect to the prior year's results. The Company also paid a special dividend in 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Company plans to continue to deploy excess cash and may do so in a variety of ways, which may include repurchasing outstanding shares of Class A common stock, paying dividends to stockholders and repurchasing its outstanding debt.\nLazard believes that the critical accounting policies set forth below comprise the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 Asset Management, which offers a broad range of global investment solutions and investment management services in equity and fixed income strategies, asset allocation strategies, alternative investments and private equity funds to corporations, public funds, sovereign entities, endowments and foundations, labor funds, financial intermediaries and private clients. \n (a) Expenses related to the consolidation of noncontrolling interests are excluded because Lazard has no economic interest in such amounts. \nThe Company's managing directors and many of its professionals have significant experience, and many of them are able to use this experience to advise on M&A, restructuring and other strategic advisory matters, depending on clients' needs. This flexibility allows Lazard to better match its professionals with the counter-cyclical business cycles of mergers and acquisitions and restructurings. While Lazard measures revenue by practice area, Lazard does not separately measure the costs or profitability of M&A services as compared to restructuring or other services. Accordingly, Lazard measures performance in its Financial Advisory segment based on overall segment operating revenue and operating income margins.\nLFB engages in lending activities, including commitments to extend credit (primarily for clients of LFG). At December 31, 2019 and 2018, customer receivables included $76 million and $64 million, respectively, of LFB loans, with such loans being fully collateralized and closely monitored for counterparty creditworthiness.\nFinancial Advisory operating income was $148 million, a decrease of $208 million, or 58%, as compared to operating income of $357 million in 2018 and, as a percentage of net revenue, was 10.8%, as compared to 22.9% in 2018.\nOperating expenses, which included $40 million associated with business realignment in 2019, increased $27 million, or 2%, as compared to 2018.\nWe consider multiple possible sources of taxable income when assessing a valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset, including:\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 versus December 31, 2018\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income taxes for each of our tax-paying entities in its respective jurisdiction. In addition to estimating actual current tax liabilities for these jurisdictions, we also must account for the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting of items, such as basis adjustments, compensation and benefits expense, and depreciation and amortization. Differences which are temporary in nature result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets and our unrecognized tax benefits.\n (d) Includes base salaries and benefits of $705,156, $695,398 and $648,130 for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and cash incentive compensation of $390,852, $445,462 and $465,582 for the respective years. \nThe fees that we receive for providing investment management and advisory services are primarily driven by the level of AUM and the nature of the AUM product mix. Accordingly, market movements, foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changes in our AUM product mix will impact the level of revenues we receive from our Asset Management business when comparing periodic results. A substantial portion of our AUM is invested in equities. Movements in AUM during the period generally reflect the changes in equity market indices.\nNet revenue trends in Financial Advisory are generally correlated to the level of completed industry-wide M&A transactions and restructuring transactions occurring subsequent to corporate debt defaults, respectively. However, deviations from this relationship can occur in any given year for a number of reasons. For instance, our results can diverge from industry-wide activity where there are material variances from the level of industry-wide M&A activity in a particular market where Lazard has significant market share, or regarding the relative number of our advisory engagements with respect to larger-sized transactions, and where we are involved in non-public or sovereign advisory assignments.\n (iii) amounts in excess of the target payout level for PRSU and PRPU awards at the end of their respective performance periods; and \nCredit Concentrations\n\n \u2022 nature, frequency, magnitude and duration of any past losses and current operating results; \nWe regularly monitor our liquidity position, including cash levels, investments in U.S. Treasury securities, credit lines, principal investment commitments, interest and principal payments on debt, capital expenditures, dividend payments, purchases of shares of Class A common stock and matters relating to liquidity and to compliance with regulatory net capital requirements. At December 31, 2019, Lazard had approximately $1,232 million of cash, with such amount including approximately $612 million held at Lazard's operations outside the U.S. Lazard provides for income taxes on substantially all of its foreign earnings. We expect that no material amount of additional taxes would be recognized upon receipt of dividends or distributions of such earnings from our foreign operations.\nRisks Related to Cash and Cash Equivalents and Corporate Indebtedness\nOn January 1, 2017, we adopted new accounting guidance on share-based incentive compensation. As a result of the adoption of this new guidance, we recognized excess tax benefits of $11 million, $33 million and $9 million from the vesting of share-based incentive compensation in the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Upon adoption of the new guidance, we also recorded deferred tax assets of $82 million, net of a valuation allowance of $12 million, for previously unrecognized excess tax benefits (including tax benefits from dividends or dividend equivalents) on share-based incentive compensation, with an offsetting adjustment to retained earnings. The new guidance has since January 1, 2017 affected, and the Company expects that in future periods the new guidance will affect, the provision for income taxes for the delivery of stock under share-based incentive compensation arrangements, as well as the effective tax rate in the relevant periods, which could be material to the consolidated statements of operations and the classification of cash flows in the relevant periods.\n (f) Represents losses associated with the closing of certain offices as part of business realignment. \nCertain market data with respect to our Financial Advisory and Asset Management businesses is included below.\n\nWe operate in cyclical businesses across multiple geographies, industries and asset classes. In recent years, we have expanded our geographic reach, bolstered our industry expertise and continued to build in growth areas. Companies, government bodies and investors seek independent advice with a geographic perspective, deep understanding of capital structure, informed research and knowledge of global, regional and local economic conditions. We believe that our business model as an independent advisor will continue to create opportunities for us to attract new clients and key personnel.\nSee Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d and Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to income taxes.\nOperating expenses, which included (i) in 2019, $8 million associated with business realignment and (ii) in 2018, $10 million relating to expenses associated with an unconditional commitment to the Lazard Foundation, increased $46 million in 2019, primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense, which reflected an increase in charges pertaining to LFI.\n \u2022 Financial Advisory, which offers corporate, partnership, institutional, government, sovereign and individual clients across the globe a wide array of financial advisory services regarding mergers and acquisitions ( M&A\u201d), capital advisory, restructurings, shareholder advisory, sovereign advisory, capital raising and other strategic advisory matters, and \n\n \u2022 the performance obligations in the contract have been identified; \nThe following table sets forth information relating to Lazard's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019:\nThe following is a discussion of net revenue and operating income for the Company's segments: Financial Advisory, Asset Management and Corporate. Each segment's operating expenses include (i) compensation and benefits expenses that are incurred directly in support of the segment and (ii) other operating expenses, which include directly incurred expenses for occupancy and equipment, marketing and business development, technology and information services, professional services, fund administration and outsourcing, and indirect support costs (including compensation and benefits expense and other operating expenses related thereto) for administrative services. Such administrative services include, but are not limited to, accounting, tax, human resources, legal, information technology, facilities management and senior management activities. Such support costs are allocated to the relevant segments based on various statistical drivers such as revenue, headcount, square footage and other factors.\n (a) No individual client constituted more than 10% of our Financial Advisory segment net revenue in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. \n \u2022 we add incentive compensation with respect to the fiscal year, which is comprised of: \nInvestments consist primarily of interest-bearing deposits, debt and equity securities, and interests in alternative investment, debt, equity and private equity funds.\nWe also use adjusted compensation and benefits expense\u201d and the ratio of adjusted compensation and benefits expense\u201d to operating revenue,\u201d both non-GAAP measures, for comparison of compensation and benefits expense between periods. For the reconciliations and calculations with respect to adjusted compensation and benefits expense\u201d and awarded compensation and benefits expense\u201d and related ratios to operating revenue,\u201d see the table under Consolidated Results of Operations\u201d below.\nTable 205: <table> <tr> <td>\nEquity market indices for major markets at December 31, 2019 generally increased as compared to such indices at December 31, 2018. Equity market indices for major markets at December 31, 2018 generally decreased as compared to such indices at December 31, 2017.\nSee Notes 15 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Lazard's stockholders' equity and incentive plans, respectively.\nOperating Results\n \u2022 we reduce the amounts in (i), (ii) and (iii) above by an estimate of future forfeitures with respect to such awards. \nConsolidation\n\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, total investments with a fair value of $531 million and $575 million, respectively, included $34 million and $57 million, respectively, or 6% and 10%, respectively, of investments that were classified using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient. See Notes 6 and 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding investments measured at fair value, including the levels of fair value within which such measurements of fair value fall.\nLazard's consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars. Many of Lazard's non-U.S. subsidiaries have a functional currency (i.e., the currency in which operational activities are primarily conducted) that is other than the U.S. Dollar, generally the currency of the country in which such subsidiaries are domiciled. Such subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at the respective balance sheet date exchange rates, while revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year based on the daily closing exchange rates. Adjustments that result from translating amounts from a subsidiary's functional currency are reported as a component of stockholders' equity. Foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on transactions in non-functional currencies are included on the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nWe maintain lines of credit in excess of anticipated liquidity requirements. As of December 31, 2019, Lazard had approximately $168 million in unused lines of credit available to it, including a $150 million, five-year, senior revolving credit facility with a group of lenders that expires in September 2020 (the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\u201d) (see -Financing Activities\u201d below) and unused lines of credit available to LFB of approximately $17 million.\nEarnings from operations decreased $171 million, or 23%, as compared to 2018, and, as a percentage of operating revenue, was 22.9%, as compared to 27.4% in 2018.\nOperating Activities\n (b) Represents changes in fair value of the compensation liability recorded in connection with LFI and other similar deferred incentive compensation awards for which a corresponding equal amount is excluded from operating revenue. \n\n\n \u2022 the fee or other transaction price has been allocated to each performance obligation in the contract; and \nOur operating expenses also include non-compensation expense\u201d, which includes costs for occupancy and equipment, marketing and business development, technology and information services, professional services, fund administration and outsourced services and other expenses. Our occupancy costs represent a significant portion of our aggregate operating expenses and are subject to change from time to time, particularly as leases for real property expire and are renewed or replaced with new, long-term leases for the same or other real property.\n (a) Includes in 2019, 2018 and 2017, benefits of $503, $6,495 and $202,546, respectively, pursuant to the tax receivable agreement. \nThe following table summarizes the reported operating results attributable to the Corporate segment:\nThe following table summarizes the reported operating results attributable to the Asset Management segment:\nAs of February 18, 2020, AUM was $247.8 billion, a $0.4 billion decrease since December 31, 2019. The decrease in AUM was due to foreign exchange depreciation of $3.7 billion and net outflows of $1.4 billion, offset by market appreciation of $4.7 billion.\nThe majority of Lazard's operating expenses relate to compensation and benefits for managing directors and employees. Our compensation and benefits expense includes (i) salaries and benefits, (ii) amortization of the relevant portion of previously granted deferred incentive compensation awards, including (a) share-based incentive compensation under the Lazard Ltd 2018 Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2018 Plan\u201d) and the Lazard Ltd 2008 Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2008 Plan\u201d), and (b) LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements (see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), (iii) a provision for discretionary or guaranteed cash bonuses and profit pools and (iv) when applicable, severance payments. Compensation expense in any given period is dependent on many factors, including general economic and market conditions, our actual and forecasted operating and financial performance, staffing levels, estimated forfeiture rates, competitive pay conditions and the nature of revenues earned, as well as the mix between current and deferred compensation.\nThe Company earns performance-based incentive fees on various investment products, including traditional products and alternative investment funds, such as hedge funds and private equity funds.\n (d) In 2019 and 2018, represents charges pertaining to the redemption of the Company's 4.25% senior notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes\u201d), due to the non-operating nature of such transaction. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Financing Activities.\u201d \nRecent Accounting Developments\n (b) Includes net changes in operating assets and liabilities. \n (a) At December 31, 2019 and 2018, seed investments in directly owned equity securities were invested as follows: \nOur principal sources of revenue are derived from activities in the following business segments:\nThese investments, with the exception of interest-bearing deposits, are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition, and any increases or decreases in the fair value of these investments are reflected in earnings. The fair value of investments is generally based upon market prices or the net asset value ( NAV\u201d) or its equivalent for investments in funds. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the measurement of the fair value of investments.\nLazard's Asset Management segment principally includes LAM, LFG and Edgewater. Asset Management net revenue is derived from fees for investment management and advisory services provided to clients. As noted above, the main driver of Asset Management net revenue is the level and product mix of AUM, which is generally influenced by the performance of the global equity markets and, to a lesser extent, fixed income markets as well as Lazard's investment performance, which impacts its ability to successfully attract and retain assets. As a result, fluctuations (including timing thereof) in financial markets and client asset inflows and outflows have a direct effect on Asset Management net revenue and operating income. Asset Management fees are generally based on the level of AUM measured daily, monthly or quarterly, and an increase or reduction in AUM, due to market price fluctuations, currency fluctuations, changes in product mix, or net client asset flows will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in management fees. The majority of our investment advisory contracts are generally terminable at any time or on notice of 30 days or less. Institutional and individual clients, and firms with which we have strategic alliances, can terminate their relationship with us, reduce the aggregate amount of AUM or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for a number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates and financial market performance. In addition, as Lazard's AUM includes significant amounts of assets that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. Dollars, changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies will impact the value of Lazard's AUM and the overall amount of management fees generated by the AUM. Fees vary with the type of assets managed and the vehicle in which they are managed, with higher fees earned on equity assets and alternative investment funds, such as hedge funds and private equity funds, and lower fees earned on fixed income and cash management products.\nLazard enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge exposures to currency exchange rates and interest rates and uses total return swap contracts on various equity and debt indices to hedge a portion of its market exposure with respect to certain seed investments related to our Asset Management business. Derivative contracts are recorded at fair value. Derivative assets amounted to $1 million and $12 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and derivative liabilities, excluding the derivative liability arising from the Company's obligation pertaining to LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements, amounted to $10 million and $1 million at such respective dates.\nFinancial Advisory net revenue decreased $181 million, or 12%, as compared to 2018. The decrease in Financial Advisory net revenue was primarily a result of a decrease in the number of fees greater than $5 million as compared to 2018.\nNet revenue decreased $240 million, or 8%, with operating revenue decreasing $209 million, or 8%, as compared to 2018. Fee revenue from investment banking and other advisory activities decreased $183 million, or 12%, as compared to 2018. Asset management fees, including incentive fees, decreased $88 million, or 7%, as compared to 2018. In the aggregate, interest income, other revenue and interest expense increased $31 million as compared to 2018.\n (d) Represents changes in the fair value of investments held in connection with LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements for which a corresponding equal amount is excluded from compensation and benefits expense. \nLazard is a holding company that is treated as a publicly traded partnership for U.S. tax purposes, and our U.S. and certain foreign subsidiaries were impacted by the Tax Act. See Notes 19 and 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the impact of the Tax Act on us.\nIn addition, we record selected other activities in our Corporate segment, including management of cash, investments, deferred tax assets, outstanding indebtedness, certain contingent obligations, and assets and liabilities associated with Lazard Group's Paris-based subsidiary, Lazard Fr\u00e8res Banque SA ( LFB\u201d).\n (c) At December 31, 2019 and 2018, includes investments in U.S. Treasury securities of approximately $100 million and $200 million, respectively, with original maturities of greater than three months and less than one year. \nSee Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding senior debt.\nEffect of Inflation\nAs of December 31, 2019, AUM with foreign currency exposure represented approximately 67% of our total AUM, as compared to 70% at December 31, 2018. AUM with foreign currency exposure generally declines in value with the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar and increases in value as the U.S. Dollar weakens, with all other factors held constant.\nStockholders' Equity\n\n\n Source: Dealogic as of January 3, 2020. \n \u2022 Voting Interest Entities. VOEs are entities in which (i) the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance itself independently and (ii) the equity holders have the obligation to absorb losses, the right to receive residual returns and the right to make decisions about the entity's activities. Lazard is required to consolidate a VOE if it holds a majority of the voting interest in such VOE. \nThe Company's liquidity and capital resources are derived from operating activities, financing activities and equity offerings.\nRisks Related to Receivables\nSubsequent to the initial recognition of deferred tax assets, we also must continually assess the likelihood that such deferred tax assets will be realized. If we determine that we may not fully derive the benefit from a deferred tax asset, we consider whether it would be appropriate to apply a valuation allowance against the applicable deferred tax asset, taking into account all available information. The ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset for a particular entity depends, among other things, on the generation of taxable income by such entity in the applicable jurisdiction.\nOther revenue increased $56 million as compared to 2018, primarily due to higher income in 2019 attributable to investments held in connection with LFI.\nFinancial Statement Overview\n (a) Represents expenses associated with the Enterprise Resource Planning ( ERP\u201d) system implementation. \nThe tables below describe the components of operating revenue, adjusted and awarded compensation and benefits expense, adjusted non-compensation expense, earnings from operations and related key ratios, which are non-GAAP measures used by the Company to manage its business. We believe such non-GAAP measures provide the most meaningful basis for comparison between present, historical and future periods, as described above.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk-At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company's exposure to foreign exchange rate risk in its investment portfolio, which primarily relates to investments in foreign currency denominated equity and debt securities, was $37 million and $41 million, respectively. A significant portion of the Company's foreign currency exposure related to our equity and debt investment portfolios is hedged through the aforementioned total return swaps. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar would result in a decrease of approximately $0.2 million and $0.1 million in the carrying value of such investments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, including the effect of the hedging transactions.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) was enacted. The Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax system by, among other changes, lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, implementing a partial territorial tax system and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on the deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Act also included several provisions that limited the benefit of the tax rate reduction, such as restricting the deductibility of interest expense and other corporate business expenses. The Tax Act further included anti-base erosion provisions such as the BEAT and tax on GILTI. The GILTI provisions impose a tax on certain income from foreign operations and we have elected to account for the tax on GILTI as a current period expense.\n (b) Reduction in the Corporate segment in 2018 relates to a realignment of certain headcount from Corporate to the Financial Advisory and Asset Management segments. \nEither directly, or through our third-party vendors, we perform a variety of regular due diligence procedures on our pricing service providers. Those procedures include oversight by our internal operations group, review of the pricing service providers' internal control frameworks, review of the pricing service providers' valuation methodologies, reconciliation to client custodial account values and comparison of significant pricing differences.\nContractual Obligations\nInvestments\nItem 7.\nWe do not believe inflation will significantly affect our compensation costs as they are substantially variable in nature. However, the rate of inflation may affect certain of our other expenses, such as information technology and occupancy costs. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other effects upon the securities markets or general macroeconomic conditions, it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations by impacting overall levels of M&A activity, reducing our AUM or net revenue, or otherwise. See Item 1A, Risk Factors-Other Business Risks-Difficult market conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the volume of the transactions involving our Financial Advisory business and reducing the value or performance of the assets we manage in our Asset Management business, which, in each case, could materially reduce our revenue or income and adversely affect our financial position\u201d.\nThe Company's cash flows are influenced primarily by the timing of the receipt of Financial Advisory and Asset Management fees, the timing of distributions to shareholders, payments of incentive compensation to managing directors and employees and purchases of Class A common stock. Cash flows were also affected: (i) in 2019, by Lazard Group's issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.375% senior notes maturing in 2029 (the 2029 Notes\u201d); (ii) in 2018, by Lazard Group's issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.50% senior notes maturing in 2028 (the 2028 Notes\u201d) and (iii) in 2019 and 2018, the redemption of the 2020 Notes.\n\nRisk Management\n (a) Consists of the following: \n (c) Revenue related to the consolidation of noncontrolling interests is excluded from operating revenue because the Company has no economic interest in such amount. \nCorporate Results of Operations\nAsset Management\nRegulatory Capital\nA significant portion of the Company's indebtedness has fixed interest rates, while its cash and cash equivalents generally have market interest rates. Based on account balances as of December 31, 2019, Lazard estimates that its annual operating income relating to cash and cash equivalents would increase by approximately $12 million in the event interest rates were to increase by 1% and decrease by approximately $12 million if rates were to decrease by 1%.\n (a) See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding business realignment. \nRevenue Recognition\nbusiness development expenses in 2019. The ratio of adjusted non-compensation expense to operating revenue was 19.6% for 2019, as compared to 17.6% in 2018.\nAsset Management\nOperational risk is inherent in all of our businesses and may, for example, manifest itself in the form of errors, breaches in the system of internal controls, employee misconduct, business interruptions, fraud, including fraud perpetrated by third parties, or legal actions due to operating deficiencies or noncompliance. The Company maintains a framework including policies and a system of internal controls designed to monitor and manage operational risk and provide management with timely and accurate information. Management within each of the operating companies is primarily responsible for its operational risk programs. The Company has in place business continuity and disaster recovery programs that manage its capabilities to provide services in the case of a disruption. We purchase insurance policies designed to help protect the Company against accidental loss and losses that may significantly affect our financial objectives, personnel, property or our ability to continue to meet our responsibilities to our various stakeholder groups. See Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d above for more information regarding operational risk in our business.\n (d) Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash consists of cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks and short-term investments and cash deposited with clearing organizations and other segregated cash. \nAsset Management Results of Operations\nBusiness Realignment\nAs long as the lenders' commitments remain in effect, any loan pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement remains outstanding and unpaid or any other amount is due to the lending bank group, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement includes financial covenants that require that Lazard Group not permit (i) its Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) for the 12-month period ending on the last day of any fiscal quarter to be greater than 3.25 to 1.00 or (ii) its Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) for the 12-month period ending on the last day of any fiscal quarter to be less than 3.00 to 1.00. For the 12-month period ended December 31, 2019, Lazard Group was in compliance with such ratios, with its Consolidated Leverage Ratio being 1.84 to 1.00 and its Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio being 12.82 to 1.00. In any event, no amounts were outstanding under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2019.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 versus December 31, 2018\nOn an ongoing basis, regional, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including trade policy and regional tax and regulatory reform, may impact our business. Overall, the global macroeconomic environment remains favorable, equity market fundamentals are strong and credit is widely available.\nAUM primarily consists of debt and equity instruments, which have a value that is readily available based on either prices quoted on a recognized exchange or prices provided by external pricing services.\n\nData relating to investments is set forth below:\nA review of our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2018 appears below. A detailed review of our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 under the caption Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Operating Results\u201d.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company held seed investments of approximately $113 million and $90 million, respectively. Seed investments held in entities in which the Company maintained a controlling interest were $47 million in seven entities as of December 31, 2019, as compared to $31 million in eight entities as of December 31, 2018.\n (e) Composed of investments held in connection with LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements. The market risk associated with such investments is equally offset by the market risk associated with the derivative liability with respect to awards expected to vest. The Company is subject to market risk associated with any portion of such investments that employees may forfeit. See -Risk Management-Risks Related to Derivatives\u201d for risk management information relating to derivatives. LFI investments held in entities in which the Company maintained a controlling interest were $93 million in eight entities as of December 31, 2019, as compared to $69 million in three entities as of December 31, 2018. \nAmended and Restated Tax Receivable Agreement\nThe geographical distribution of Financial Advisory net revenue is set forth below in percentage terms and is based on the Lazard offices that generate Financial Advisory net revenue, which are located in the Americas (primarily in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America), EMEA (primarily in the U.K., France, Germany, Italy and Spain) and the Asia Pacific region (primarily in Australia) and therefore may not be reflective of the geography in which the clients are located.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide coverage for probable losses from our receivables. We determine the adequacy of the allowance by estimating the probability of loss based on our analysis of the client's creditworthiness, among other things, and specifically provide for exposures where we determine the receivables are impaired. At December 31, 2019, total receivables amounted to $663 million, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $27 million. As of that date, Financial Advisory and Asset Management fees, and customers and other receivables comprised 81% and 19% of total receivables, respectively. At December 31, 2018, total receivables amounted to $686 million, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $40 million. As of that date, Financial Advisory and Asset Management fees, and customers and other receivables comprised 73% and 27% of total receivables, respectively. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had receivables past due or deemed uncollectible of approximately $43 million and $42 million, respectively. See also Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Revenue Recognition\u201d above and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding receivables.\nWe record tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return based upon our estimates regarding the amount that is more likely than not to be realized or paid, including in connection with the resolution of any related appeals or other legal processes. Accordingly, we recognize liabilities for certain unrecognized tax benefits based on the amounts that are more likely than not to be settled with the relevant taxing authority. Such liabilities are evaluated periodically as new information becomes available and any changes in the amounts of such liabilities are recorded as adjustments to income tax expense.\u201d Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits involve significant judgment and the ultimate resolution of such matters may be materially different from our estimates.\n (c) Consists primarily of purchases of shares of Class A common stock, tax withholdings related to the settlement of vested RSUs, vested restricted stock awards and vested PRSUs, Class A common stock dividends, changes in customer deposits, distributions to noncontrolling interest holders, and activity relating to borrowings (including, in 2019 and 2018, the redemption of the 2020 Notes and the issuance of the 2029 and 2028 Notes, respectively). \nBusiness Environment and Outlook\nAsset Management operating income was $350 million, a decrease of $70 million, or 17%, as compared to operating income of $420 million in 2018 and, as a percentage of net revenue, was 28.3%, as compared to 31.5% in 2018.\nFor additional information regarding risks associated with our investments, see Risk Management-Investments\u201d below as well as Item 1A, Risk Factors-Other Business Risks-Our results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the fair value of positions held in our investment portfolios\u201d.\nThe provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of 24.2%, as compared to 21.8% in 2018. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Critical Accounting Policies-Income Taxes\u201d below.\nWe also invest our own capital from time to time, generally alongside capital of qualified institutional and individual investors in alternative investments or private equity investments, and, since 2005, we have engaged in a number of alternative investments and private equity activities, including, historically, investments through (i)\nAmortization and other acquisition-related (benefits) costs reflect a cost of $19 million in the 2019 period, as compared to a benefit of $16 million in the 2018 period, primarily due to the change in the fair market value of contingent consideration.\n \u2022 the Company has satisfied the applicable performance obligation. \nLazard is subject to market and credit risk on investments held. As such, gains and losses on investment positions held, which arise from sales or changes in the fair value of the investments, are not predictable and can cause periodic fluctuations in net income.\nSummary of Cash Flows:\nRisks Related to Derivatives\n \u2022 we deduct amortization expense recorded for accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) purposes in the fiscal year associated with deferred incentive compensation awards; \nIncome Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted. The Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax system by, among other changes, lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, implementing a partial territorial tax system and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on the deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Act also included several provisions that limited the benefit of the tax rate reduction, such as restricting the deductibility of interest expense and other corporate business expenses. The Tax Act further included anti-base erosion provisions such as the BEAT and tax on GILTI and in 2019, the IRS issued broad and complex final and proposed regulations interpreting such provisions of the Tax Act.\n \u2022 future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards; \nFor private equity funds, incentive fees may be earned in the form of a carried interest\u201d if profits arising from realized investments exceed a specified threshold. Typically, such carried interest is ultimately calculated on a whole-fund basis and, therefore, clawback of carried interest during the life of the fund can occur. As a result, incentive fees earned on our private equity funds are not recognized until potential uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizable amounts have been determined, including any potential for clawback.", "item_7_tables": "Table 160: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>
