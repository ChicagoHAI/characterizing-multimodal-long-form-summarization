The Company cautions readers that forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those relating to the Company's future business prospects, revenues, working capital, liquidity, capital needs, interest costs, and income, are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, due to several important factors herein identified. These factors include the Company's ability to find suitable acquisition properties at favorable terms, financing, licensing, business conditions, risks of downturn in economic conditions generally, satisfaction of closing conditions such as those pertaining to licensure, availability of insurance at commercially reasonable rates, and changes in accounting principles and interpretations, among others, and other risks and factors identified from time to time in the Company's reports filed with the SEC.\nOverview\nThe following discussion and analysis addresses (i) the Company's results of operations on a historical consolidated basis for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, and (ii) liquidity and capital resources of the Company and should be read in conjunction with the Company's historical consolidated financial statements and the selected financial data contained elsewhere in this report.\nThe Company is one of the largest operators of senior housing communities in the United States. The Company's operating strategy is to provide value to its senior living residents by providing quality senior living services at reasonable prices, while achieving and sustaining a strong, competitive position within its geographically concentrated regions, as well as continuing to enhance the performance of its operations. The Company provides senior living services to the elderly, including independent living, assisted living, and memory care services at reasonable prices. Many of the Company's communities offer a continuum of care to meet its residents' needs as they change over time. This continuum of care, which integrates independent living, assisted living, and memory care, and is bridged by home care through independent home care agencies, sustains residents' autonomy and independence based on their physical and mental abilities.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company operated 129 senior housing communities in 23 states with an aggregate capacity of approximately 16,500 residents, including 83 senior housing communities which the Company owned and 46 senior housing communities the Company leased.\nSignificant Financial and Operational Highlights\nThe Company primarily derives its revenue by providing senior living housing and services to the elderly. When comparing fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2016, the Company generated total revenues of approximately $467.0 million compared to total revenues of approximately $447.4 million, respectively, representing an increase of approximately $19.5 million, or 4.4%. The increase in revenues primarily results from a full year of activity for the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2016 which resulted in an increase in revenue of approximately $15.3 million and we experienced an increase in revenue at our same-store communities of approximately $4.3 million. The increase in revenue at our same-store communities during fiscal 2017 was negatively impacted by Hurricane Harvey which resulted in the full evacuation of our residents at two of our senior housing communities located in southeast Texas. Both of these communities are undergoing repairs and remain fully vacated which resulted in a decrease of approximately $3.5 million in our same-store revenue during fiscal 2017.\nExcluding the two senior housing communities impacted by Hurricane Harvey, the weighted average financial occupancy rate for each of our consolidated and same-store communities for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was 86.8% and 87.9%, respectively. Although each of our consolidated and same-store occupancies declined, we achieved an increase in average monthly rental rates at our consolidated and same-store communities when comparing fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2016 of 3.3% and 2.8%, respectively. The increase in average monthly rental rates during fiscal 2017 was primarily the result of our recent senior housing community acquisitions, annual rent increases for our existing residents, and the capital improvements we have invested in our communities for unit conversions which enable us to provide a broader range of senior living services at higher levels of care.\nOn December 15, 2017, the Company completed supplemental mortgage financing of approximately $4.1 million from Fannie Mae at a fixed interest rate of 5.71% on one community located in Oneonta, New York. The supplemental mortgage loan is coterminous, cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with the original existing mortgage debt maturing in June 2025.\nOn November 30, 2017, the Company completed supplemental mortgage financing of approximately $3.0 million from Fannie Mae at a fixed interest rate of 5.49% on one community located in Rocky River, Ohio. The supplemental mortgage loan is coterminous, cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with the original existing mortgage debt maturing in January 2023.\nThe Company had two of its senior housing communities located in southeast Texas impacted by Hurricane Harvey during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Both of these communities remain fully vacated and are undergoing repairs. We maintain insurance coverage on these communities which includes damage caused by flooding. The insurance claim for this incident required a deductible of $100,000 that was expensed as a component of operating expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Through December 31, 2017, we have incurred approximately $3.9 million in clean-up and physical repair costs and we expect to incur additional repair costs which we believe are probable of being recovered through insurance proceeds. In addition to the repairs of physical damage to the buildings, the Company's insurance coverage includes loss of business income ( Business Interruption\u201d). Business Interruption includes reimbursement for lost revenue as well as incremental expenses incurred as a result of the hurricane. The Company received payments from our insurance underwriters during fiscal 2017 totaling approximately $2.7 million of which approximately $2.2 million related to Business Interruption through December 31, 2017, which has been included as a reduction to operating expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss in fiscal 2017. Based upon our initial assessment of the physical damages and insurance coverage, the Company currently estimates insurance proceeds will be sufficient to reimburse the Company for all damages and repair costs to fully restore the communities to their condition prior to the incident.\nEffective January 31, 2017, the Company acquired the underlying real estate associated with four of the senior housing communities previously leased from Ventas, Inc. ( Ventas\u201d) for an acquisition price of $85.0 million (the Four Property Lease Transaction\u201d). The Company obtained interest only, bridge financing from Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC ( Berkadia\u201d) for $65.0 million of the acquisition price with an initial variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 4.0% and a 36-month term, with the balance of the acquisition price paid from the Company's existing cash resources. For additional information refer to Note 3, Acquisitions\u201d, within the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nFacility Leases\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company leased 46 senior housing communities from certain real estate investment trusts ( REITs\u201d). The lease terms are generally for 10-15 years with renewal options for 5-20 years at the Company's option. Under these lease agreements, the Company is responsible for all operating costs, maintenance and repairs, insurance and property taxes. No new facility leases were entered into by the Company during fiscal 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company leased 7 senior housing communities (collectively the Ventas Lease Agreements\u201d) from Ventas, Inc. ( Ventas\u201d). Effective January 31, 2017, the Company closed the Four Property Lease Transaction and acquired from Ventas the underlying real estate associated with four of its operating leases for a total acquisition price of $85.0 million. The Company obtained interim, interest only, bridge financing from Berkadia for $65.0 million of the acquisition price with an initial variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 4.0% and a 36-month term, with the balance of the acquisition price paid from the Company's existing cash resources. For additional information refer to Note 3, Acquisitions\u201d, within the notes to consolidated financial statements. Prior to the Four Property Lease Transaction, the Company previously leased 11 senior housing communities from Ventas.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company executed amendments to the master lease agreements with Ventas to facilitate up to $24.5 million of leasehold improvements for 10 communities within the Ventas lease portfolio and extend the lease terms until September 30, 2025, with two five-year renewal extensions available at the Company's option. During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company executed amendments to the master lease agreements with Ventas to increase the Special Project Funds for leasehold improvements from $24.5 million to $28.5 million and extend the date for completion of the leasehold improvements to June 30, 2017. During fiscal 2017, the Company executed amendments to the master lease agreements with Ventas to decrease the Special Project Funds for leasehold improvements from $28.5 million to approximately $17.0 million due to the Four Property Lease Transaction and extend the date for completion of the leasehold improvements to June 30, 2018. The initial lease rates under each of the Ventas Lease Agreements ranged from 6.75% to 8% and are subject to certain conditional escalation clauses which will be recognized when probable or incurred. The Company initially incurred $11.4 million in lease acquisition and modification costs related to the Ventas Lease Agreements, of which a portion of these costs were written-off upon closing the Four Property Lease Transaction leaving $8.7 million in lease acquisition and modification costs associated with the remaining properties. These deferred lease acquisition and modification costs are being amortized over the lease terms and are included in facility lease expense in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company accounts for five of the Ventas Lease Agreements as an operating lease and two as a capital lease and financing obligation.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company leased 15 senior housing communities (collectively the HCP Lease Agreements\u201d) from HCP, Inc. ( HCP\u201d). During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company executed an amendment to the master lease agreement with HCP to facilitate up to $3.3 million of leasehold improvements for one community within the HCP lease portfolio and extend the initial lease terms for nine communities until October 31, 2020, with two 10-year renewal extensions available at the Company's option. During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company exercised its right to extend the lease term with HCP for the remaining six communities in the HCP lease portfolio until April 30, 2026, with one 10-year renewal extension available at the Company's option. The initial lease rates under the HCP Lease Agreements ranged from 7.25% to 8% and are subject to certain conditional escalation clauses, which will be recognized when probable or incurred. The Company incurred $1.6 million in lease acquisition and modification costs related to the HCP Lease Agreements. These deferred lease acquisition and modification costs are being amortized over the lease terms and are included in facility lease expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company accounts for each of the HCP Lease Agreements as an operating lease.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company leased 24 senior housing communities (collectively the Welltower Lease Agreements\u201d) from Welltower, Inc., formerly Health Care REIT, Inc. ( Welltower\u201d). The Welltower Lease Agreements each have an initial term of 15 years, with one 15-year renewal extension available at the Company's option. The initial lease rates under the Welltower Lease Agreements ranged from 7.25% to 8.5% and are subject to certain conditional escalation clauses, which will be recognized when probable or incurred. The initial terms on the Welltower Lease Agreements expire on various dates through April 2026. The Company incurred $2.1 million in lease acquisition costs related to the Welltower Lease Agreements. These deferred lease acquisition costs are being amortized over the lease terms and are included in facility lease expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company accounts for each of the Welltower Lease Agreements as an operating lease.\nThe following table summarizes each of the Company's facility lease agreements as of December 31, 2017 (dollars

The supplemental mortgage loan is coterminous, cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with the original existing mortgage debt maturing in June 2025.\nOn December 1, 2017, the Company renewed certain insurance policies and entered into a finance agreement totaling approximately $3.5 million. The finance agreement has a fixed interest rate of 3.04% with the principal being repaid over an 11-month term.\nOn November 30, 2017, the Company completed supplemental mortgage financing of approximately $3.0 million from Fannie Mae at a fixed interest rate of 5.49% on one community located in Rocky River, Ohio. The supplemental mortgage loan is coterminous, cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with the original existing mortgage debt maturing in January 2023.\nOn May 31, 2017, the Company renewed certain insurance policies and entered into a finance agreement totaling approximately $1.6 million. The finance agreement has a fixed interest rate of 2.76% with the principal being repaid over an 11-month term.\nOn January 31, 2017, in conjunction with the Four Property Lease Transaction, the Company obtained $65.0 million of mortgage debt from Berkadia. The new mortgage loan is interest-only and has a three-year term with an initial variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 4.00%.\nThe Company issued standby letters of credit with Wells Fargo Bank ( Wells Fargo\u201d), totaling approximately $3.9 million, for the benefit of Hartford Financial Services ( Hartford\u201d) associated with the administration of workers compensation.\nThe Company issued standby letters of credit with JPMorgan Chase Bank ( Chase\u201d), totaling approximately $6.7 million, for the benefit of Welltower, on certain leases between Welltower and the Company.\nThe Company issued standby letters of credit with Chase, totaling approximately $2.9 million, for the benefit of HCP on certain leases between HCP and the Company.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related notes. Management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience, observance of industry trends and various other sources of information and factors, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The Company believes the following are our most critical accounting policies and/or typically require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.\nRevenue Recognition\nResident revenue is recognized at estimated net realizable amounts, based on historical experiences, due from residents in the period to which the rental and other services are provided. Additionally, substantially all community fees received from residents are non-refundable and are recorded initially by the Company as deferred revenue. The deferred amounts are amortized over the respective residents' initial lease term which is consistent with the contractual obligation associated with the estimated stay of the resident.\nRevenues from the Medicaid program accounted for approximately 5.6% of the Company's revenue in fiscal 2017, 5.5% of the Company's revenue in fiscal 2016, and 4.6% of the Company's revenue in fiscal 2015. During fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, 41, 40, and 34, respectively, of the Company's communities were providers of services under Medicaid programs. Accordingly, these communities were entitled to reimbursement under the foregoing program at established rates that were lower than private pay rates. Patient service revenue for Medicaid patients was recorded at the reimbursement rates as the rates were set prospectively by the applicable state upon the filing of an annual cost report. None of the Company's communities were providers of services under the Medicare program during fiscal 2017, 2016, or 2015.\nLaws and regulations governing the Medicaid program are complex and subject to interpretation. The Company believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and is not aware of any pending or threatened investigations involving allegations of potential wrongdoing. While no such regulatory inquiries have been made, compliance with such laws and regulations can be subject to future government review and interpretation as well as significant regulatory action including fines, penalties, and exclusion from the Medicaid program.\nPurchase Accounting\nIn determining the allocation of the purchase price of senior housing communities acquired to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, the Company makes estimates of fair value using information obtained as a result of pre-acquisition due diligence, leasing activities and/or independent appraisals. The Company assigns the purchase price for senior living communities to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values which are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations. The determination of fair value involves the use of significant judgments and estimates which is generally assessed as follows:\nThe Company allocates the fair values of buildings acquired on an as-if-vacant basis and depreciates the building values over the estimated remaining lives of the buildings, not to exceed 40 years. The Company determines the allocated values of other fixed assets, such as site improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment, based upon the replacement cost and depreciates such values over the assets' estimated remaining useful lives as determined at the acquisition date. The Company determines the value of land by considering the sales prices of similar properties in recent transactions.\nThe fair value of acquired lease-related intangibles reflects the estimated fair value of existing resident in-place leases as represented by the cost to obtain residents and an estimated absorption period to reflect the value of the rent and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease-up period as if the property acquired was vacant. The Company amortizes any acquired resident in-place lease intangibles to depreciation and amortization expense over the estimated remaining useful life of the respective resident operating leases.\nCredit Risk and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company's resident receivables are generally due within 30 days from the date billed. Accounts receivable are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $4.9 million and $4.3 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and represent the Company's estimate of the amount that ultimately will be collected. The adequacy of the Company's allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on an ongoing basis, using historical payment trends, write-off experience, analyses of receivable portfolios by payor source and aging of receivables, as well as a review of specific accounts, and adjustments are made to the allowance as necessary. Credit losses on resident receivables have historically been within management's estimates, and management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts adequately provides for expected losses.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company had no material off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2017.\nLease Accounting\nThe Company determines whether to account for its leases as operating, capital or financing leases depending on the underlying terms of each lease agreement. This determination of classification requires significant judgment relating to certain information, including the estimated fair value and remaining economic life of the community, the Company's cost of funds, minimum lease payments and other lease terms. The lease rates under the Company's lease agreements are subject to certain conditional escalation clauses which are recognized when probable or incurred and are based on changes in the consumer price index or certain operational performance measures. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company leased 46 and 50 communities, respectively, two of which the Company classified as capital lease and financing obligations with the remaining classified as operating leases. The Company incurs lease acquisition costs and amortizes these costs over the term of the respective lease agreement. Certain leases entered into by the Company qualified as sale/leaseback transactions, and as such, any related gains have been deferred and are being amortized over the respective lease term. No new communities were leased by the Company during fiscal 2017 or 2016. Effective January 31, 2017, the Company acquired from Ventas the underlying real estate associated with four of its operating leases. For additional information refer to Note 3, Acquisitions\u201d, within the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nFacility lease expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive loss includes rent expense plus amortization expense relating to leasehold acquisition costs offset by the amortization of deferred gains and lease incentives.\nEmployee Health and Dental Benefits, Workers' Compensation, and Insurance Reserves\nThe Company offers certain full-time employees an option to participate in its health and dental plans. The Company is self-insured up to certain limits and is insured if claims in excess of these limits are incurred. The cost of employee health and dental benefits, net of employee contributions, is shared between the corporate office and the senior housing communities based on the respective number of plan participants. Funds collected are used to pay the actual program costs including estimated annual claims, third-party administrative fees, network provider fees, communication costs, and other related administrative costs incurred by the plans. Claims are paid as they are submitted to the Company's third-party administrator. The Company records a liability for outstanding claims and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. This liability is based on the historical claim reporting lag and payment trends of health insurance claims. Management believes that the liability for outstanding losses and expenses is adequate to cover the ultimate cost of losses and expenses incurred at December 31, 2017; however, actual claims and expenses may differ. Any subsequent changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they are determined.\nThe Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance for workers' compensation. Determining the reserve for workers' compensation losses and costs that the Company has incurred as of the end of a reporting period involves significant judgments based on projected future events, including potential settlements for pending claims, known incidents which may result in claims, estimates of incurred but not yet reported claims, changes in insurance premiums, estimated litigation costs and other factors. The Company regularly adjusts these estimates to reflect changes in the foregoing factors. However, since this reserve is based on estimates, the actual expenses incurred may differ from the amounts reserved. Any subsequent changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they are determined.\nLong-Lived Assets\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. At each balance sheet date, the Company reviews the carrying value of its property and equipment to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that they may be impaired or that the depreciation period may need to be changed. The Company considers internal factors such as net operating losses along with external factors relating to each asset, including contract changes, local market developments, and other publicly available information. If an indicator of impairment is identified, the carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair market value, generally based on discounted cash\nflows, of the long-lived asset. The Company does not believe there are any indicators of impairment that would require an adjustment to the carrying value of the property and equipment or their remaining useful lives as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are computed using the asset and liability method and current income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year. Deferred income taxes are recorded based on the estimated future tax effects of loss carryforwards and temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect those carryforwards and temporary differences to be recovered or settled. Management regularly evaluates the future realization of deferred tax assets and provides a valuation allowance, if considered necessary, based on such evaluation. As part of the evaluation, management has evaluated taxable income in carryback years, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, feasible tax planning strategies, and future expectations of income. Based upon this evaluation, a valuation allowance has been recorded to reduce the Company's net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. However, in the event that we were to determine that it would be more likely than not that the Company would realize the benefit of deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amounts, adjustments to deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period we made such a determination. The benefits of the net deferred tax assets might not be realized if actual results differ from expectations. The effective tax rates for fiscal 2017 and 2016 differ from the statutory tax rates due to state income taxes, permanent tax differences, and changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. The Company is impacted by the Texas Margin Tax ( TMT\u201d), which effectively imposes tax on modified gross revenues for communities within the State of Texas. During each of fiscal 2017 and 2016, the Company consolidated 38 Texas communities and the TMT increased the overall provision for income taxes.\nThe Company evaluates uncertain tax positions through consideration of accounting and reporting guidance on criteria, measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition that is intended to provide better financial-statement comparability among different companies. The Company is required to recognize a tax benefit in its financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management's assessment is that its position is more likely than not\u201d (i.e., a greater than 50 percent likelihood) to be upheld on audit based only on the technical merits of the tax position. The Company's policy is to recognize interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and penalties as income tax expense. The Company is generally no longer subject to federal and state income tax audits for years prior to 2014.\nRecently Issued Accounting Guidance\nIn January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2017-01, Business Combinations - Clarifying the Definition of a Business. ASU 2017-01 provides guidance in accounting for business combinations when determining if the transaction represents acquisitions or disposals of assets or of a business. Under ASU 2017-01, when determining whether an integrated set of assets and activities constitutes a business, entities must compare the fair value of gross assets acquired to the fair value of a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in the single identifiable assets or group of similar identifiable assets, the integrated set of assets and activities is not characterized as a business. ASU 2017-01 is applied prospectively and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. Management does not expect the adoption of ASU 2017-01 to have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). ASU 2016-18 requires an entity to include in its cash and cash-equivalent balances in the statement of cash flows those amounts that are deemed to be restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. ASU 2016-18 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Management does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-18 to have a material impact on the Company's cash flows.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15 amends the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 230, which often requires judgment to determine the appropriate classification of cash flows as operating, investing or financing activities and has resulted in diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are classified. ASU 2016-15 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and should be applied on a retrospective basis. Management does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-15 to have a material impact on the Company's cash flows.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting. ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in ASU 2016-09 are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-09 on January 1, 2017, and incorporated the provisions of this update into its consolidated financial statements upon adoption. Upon adoption, the Company elected to change its accounting policy to account for forfeitures as they occur. This change was applied on a modified retrospective basis with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of $0.2 million. Additionally, the adoption of ASU 2016-09 resulted in the Company recording an adjustment of $5.3 million, which resulted in an increase to the Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowance, to recognize net operating loss carryforwards attributable to excess tax benefits on stock compensation that had not been previously recognized to additional paid in capital. Excess tax benefits for share-based payments are now included in net operating activities rather than net financing activities within the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, these reporting changes have been applied prospectively and prior periods have not been adjusted.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. ASU 2016-02 amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. ASU 2016-02 will be effective beginning in 2019. Early adoption of ASU 2016-02 as of its issuance is permitted. The new leases standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new leases standard on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets. Under ASU 2014-09, an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company has evaluated the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures. Based on our assessment, we do not believe it will have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company is planning to adopt the standard under the modified retrospective adoption.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, selected historical

million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $447.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $19.5 million, or 4.4%. The increase in resident revenue primarily results from an increase of $15.3 million from a full year of activity for the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2016 and an increase of $4.3 million due to a 2.8% increase in average monthly rental rates at the Company's same-store communities which was primarily the result of annual rent increases for our existing residents and recent capital improvements we have invested in our communities for unit conversions which enable us to provide a broader range of senior living services at higher levels of care. The increase in resident revenue at our same-store communities was negatively impacted by Hurricane Harvey which resulted in the full evacuation of our residents at two of our communities located in southeast Texas. Both of these communities are undergoing repairs and remain fully vacated which resulted in a decrease in our same-store resident revenue of approximately $3.5 million.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses were $459.2 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $433.1 million during fiscal 2016, representing an increase of $26.1 million, or 6.0%. This increase is primarily the result of a $16.8 million increase in operating expenses, a $12.9 million loss on facility lease termination, and a $5.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, slightly offset by a $5.3 million decrease in facility lease expense and a $4.0 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense.\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The increase in operating expenses primarily results from an increase of $11.6 million from a full year of activity for the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2016 and an increase of $5.2 million at the Company's same-store communities primarily due to increased wages and benefits to employees for annual merit increases and incremental costs, including increased labor costs for additional staffing required for newly licensed memory care and assisted living units, to support changes in occupancy with more of our residents at higher levels of care.

The effective tax rates for fiscal 2017 and 2016 differ from the statutory tax rates due to state income taxes, permanent tax differences, and changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. The Company is impacted by the Texas Margin Tax ( TMT\u201d), which effectively imposes tax on modified gross revenues for communities within the State of Texas. During each of fiscal 2017 and 2016, the Company consolidated 38 Texas communities and the TMT increased the overall provision for income taxes. The increase in provision for income taxes for fiscal 2017 was attributable to an increase of $0.2 million for higher state income taxes with the remaining $1.9 million due to recent tax legislation changes associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( TCJA\u201d), which was enacted on December 22, 2017.\nManagement regularly evaluates the future realization of deferred tax assets and provides a valuation allowance, if considered necessary, based on such evaluation. As part of the evaluation, management has evaluated taxable income in carryback years, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, feasible tax planning strategies, and future expectations of income. Based upon this evaluation, adjustments to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $5.9 million and $8.6 million were recorded during fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, to reduce the Company's net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nNet loss and comprehensive loss\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, the Company reported net loss and comprehensive loss of $(44.2 million) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, compared to net loss and comprehensive loss of $(28.0 million) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nRevenues\nResident revenue was $447.4 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $412.2 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, representing an increase of $35.3 million, or 8.6%. The increase in resident revenue primarily results from an increase of $31.0 million from the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2016 and a full year of activity for the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2015 and an increase of $6.8 million due to a 2.0% increase in average monthly rental rates at the Company's same-store communities, slightly offset by a decrease of $2.6 million due to the Company's sale of one of its senior housing communities located in Wichita, Kansas, (the Sedgwick Sale Transaction\u201d) and the Company's sale of four senior housing communities located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Shreveport, Louisiana, Southfield, Michigan, and Winston-Salem, North Carolina (the Four Property Sale Transaction\u201d), each of which closed in fiscal 2015.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses were $433.1 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $393.3 million during fiscal 2015, representing an increase of $39.7 million, or 10.1%. This increase in expenses is primarily the result of a $25.2 million increase in operating expenses, a $7.4 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, a $3.3 million increase in general and administrative expenses, a $2.8 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, a $0.5 million increase in provision for bad debts, and a $0.5 million increase in facility lease expense.\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The increase in operating expenses primarily results from an increase of $21.2 million from the senior housing communities acquired

loss before provision for income taxes, compared to a provision for income taxes of $0.9 million, or 6.7% of loss before provision for income taxes, for fiscal 2015. The effective tax rates for fiscal 2016 and 2015 differ from the statutory tax rates due to state income taxes, permanent tax differences, and changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. During fiscal 2015, the Company incurred $0.3 million in additional income taxes due to the taxable gain realized from the Four Property Sale Transaction. For income tax purposes, in conjunction with the Sedgwick Sale Transaction that closed in fiscal 2015 the Company executed a like-kind exchange and acquired a replacement property shortly after the sale which resulted in deferral of the gain without the Company incurring any current federal or state income tax liabilities. The Company is impacted by the TMT, which effectively imposes tax on modified gross revenues for communities within the State of Texas. During fiscal 2016 and 2015, the Company consolidated 38 and 37 Texas communities, respectively, and the TMT increased the overall provision for income taxes. Management regularly evaluates the future realization of deferred tax assets and provides a valuation allowance, if considered necessary, based on such evaluation. As part of the evaluation, management has evaluated taxable income in carryback years, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, feasible tax planning strategies, and future expectations of income. Based upon this evaluation, adjustments to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $8.6 million and $5.0 million were recorded during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, to reduce the Company's net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nNet loss and comprehensive loss\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, the Company reported net loss and comprehensive loss of $(28.0 million) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, compared to net loss and comprehensive loss of $(14.3 million) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.\nQuarterly Results\nThe following table presents certain unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the four quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

of December 31, 2017, the Company's principal sources of liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operations, supplemental debt financings, additional proceeds from debt refinancings, equity issuances, and/or proceeds from the sale of assets. The Company expects its available cash and cash flows from operations, supplemental debt financings, additional proceeds from debt refinancings, and proceeds from the sale of assets to be sufficient to fund its short-term working capital requirements. The Company's long-term capital requirements, primarily for acquisitions and other corporate initiatives, could be dependent on its ability to access additional funds through joint ventures and the debt and/or equity markets. The Company from time to time considers and evaluates transactions related to its portfolio including supplemental debt financings, debt refinancings, equity issuances, purchases and sales of assets, reorganizations and other transactions. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that the Company will be able to obtain the capital necessary to meet the Company's short and long-term capital requirements.\nChanges in the current economic environment could result in decreases in the fair value of assets, slowing of transactions, and tightening liquidity and credit markets. These impacts could make securing debt for acquisitions or refinancings for the Company, its joint ventures, or buyers of the Company's properties more difficult or on terms not acceptable to the Company. Additionally, the Company may be more susceptible to being negatively impacted by operating or performance deficits based on the exposure associated with certain lease coverage requirements.\nIn summary, the Company's cash flows were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (124,940\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (201,049\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (161,427\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 126,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 129,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Decrease) Increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (16,380\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (22,061\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nThe Company had net cash provided by operating activities of $55.6 million, $52.3 million, and $48.9 million in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.

The net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2015 primarily results from notes payable proceeds of $250.9 million, of which approximately $118.1 million is related to new mortgage debt associated with the acquisition of senior housing communities by the Company, approximately $2.2 million related to insurance premium financing, and the remaining $130.6 million resulted from supplemental financings, mortgage refinancings, or new mortgage debt obtained on existing unencumbered senior housing communities, partially offset by repayments of notes payable of $115.9 million, deferred financing charges paid of $3.8 million, payments on capital lease and financing obligations of $1.0 million, and additions to restricted cash of $0.9 million.\nDisclosures About Contractual Obligations\nThe following table provides the amounts due under specified contractual obligations for the periods indicated as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than\nOne\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> One to\nThree Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three to\nFive Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More Than\nFive Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt, including interest expense(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 196,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 249,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 718,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,231,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating and capital leases(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 126,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 144,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 435,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 131,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 322,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 350,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 862,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,666,794\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Amounts due associated with our variable rate mortgage debt is projected by applying the variable interest rates effective at December 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Reflects future minimum lease commitments under the Company's various property and equipment lease agreements at current rental rates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-term debt relates to the aggregate maturities of the Company's notes payable. As of December 31, 2017, the Company leases its corporate headquarters in Dallas, an executive office in New York, 46 senior housing communities and certain equipment used at the Company's communities.\nImpact of Inflation\nTo date, inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company. However, inflation could affect the Company's future revenues and results of operations because of, among other things, the Company's dependence on senior residents, many of whom rely primarily on fixed incomes to pay for the Company's services. As a result, during inflationary periods, the Company may not be able to increase resident service fees to account fully for increased operating expenses. In structuring its fees, the Company attempts to anticipate inflation levels, but there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to anticipate fully or otherwise respond to any future inflationary pressures.\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method and current income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year. Deferred income taxes are recorded based on the estimated future tax effects of loss carryforwards and temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect those carryforwards and temporary differences to be recovered or settled. Management regularly evaluates the future realization of deferred tax assets and provides a valuation allowance, if considered necessary, based on such evaluation. As part of the evaluation, management has evaluated taxable income in carryback years, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, feasible tax planning strategies, and future expectations of income. Based upon this evaluation, a valuation allowance has been recorded to reduce the Company's net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. However, in the event that we were to determine that it would be more likely than not that the Company would realize the benefit of deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amounts, adjustments to deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period we made such a determination. The benefits of the net deferred tax assets might not be realized if actual results differ from expectations. The effective tax rates for fiscal 2017 and 2016 differ from the statutory tax rates due to state income taxes, permanent tax differences, and changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. The Company is impacted by the Texas Margin Tax ( TMT\u201d), which effectively imposes tax on modified gross revenues for communities within the State of Texas. During each of fiscal 2017 and 2016, the Company consolidated 38 Texas communities and the TMT increased the overall provision for income taxes.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company operated 129 senior housing communities in 23 states with an aggregate capacity of approximately 16,500 residents, including 83 senior housing communities which the Company owned and 46 senior housing communities the Company leased.\nIncome Taxes\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than\nOne\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> One to\nThree Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three to\nFive Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More Than\nFive Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt, including interest expense(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 196,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 249,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 718,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,231,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating and capital leases(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 126,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 144,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 435,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 131,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 322,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 350,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 862,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,666,794\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProvision for income taxes for fiscal 2016 was $0.4 million, or 1.6% of loss before provision for income taxes, compared to a provision for income taxes of $0.9 million, or 6.7% of loss before provision for income taxes, for fiscal 2015. The effective tax rates for fiscal 2016 and 2015 differ from the statutory tax rates due to state income taxes, permanent tax differences, and changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. During fiscal 2015, the Company incurred $0.3 million in additional income taxes due to the taxable gain realized from the Four Property Sale Transaction. For income tax purposes, in conjunction with the Sedgwick Sale Transaction that closed in fiscal 2015 the Company executed a like-kind exchange and acquired a replacement property shortly after the sale which resulted in deferral of the gain without the Company incurring any current federal or state income tax liabilities. The Company is impacted by the TMT, which effectively imposes tax on modified gross revenues for communities within the State of Texas. During fiscal 2016 and 2015, the Company consolidated 38 and 37 Texas communities, respectively, and the TMT increased the overall provision for income taxes. Management regularly evaluates the future realization of deferred tax assets and provides a valuation allowance, if considered necessary, based on such evaluation. As part of the evaluation, management has evaluated taxable income in carryback years, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, feasible tax planning strategies, and future expectations of income. Based upon this evaluation, adjustments to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $8.6 million and $5.0 million were recorded during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, to reduce the Company's

During fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, 41, 40, and 34, respectively, of the Company's communities were providers of services under Medicaid programs. Accordingly, these communities were entitled to reimbursement under the foregoing program at established rates that were lower than private pay rates. Patient service revenue for Medicaid patients was recorded at the reimbursement rates as the rates were set prospectively by the applicable state upon the filing of an annual cost report. None of the Company's communities were providers of services under the Medicare program during fiscal 2017, 2016, or 2015.\nFacility lease expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss includes rent expense plus amortization expense relating to leasehold acquisition costs offset by the amortization of deferred gains and lease incentives.

one community located in Oneonta, New York. The supplemental mortgage loan is coterminous, cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with the original existing mortgage debt maturing in June 2025.\nThe Company's resident receivables are generally due within 30 days from the date billed. Accounts receivable are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $4.9 million and $4.3 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and represent the Company's estimate of the amount that ultimately will be collected. The adequacy of the Company's allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on an ongoing basis, using historical payment trends, write-off experience, analyses of receivable portfolios by payor source and aging of receivables, as well as a review of specific accounts, and adjustments are made to the allowance as necessary. Credit losses on resident receivables have historically been within management's estimates, and management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts adequately provides for expected losses.\nThe Company issued standby letters of credit with Wells Fargo Bank ( Wells Fargo\u201d), totaling approximately $3.9 million, for the benefit of Hartford Financial Services ( Hartford\u201d) associated with the administration of workers compensation.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\n (1) Amounts due associated with our variable rate mortgage debt is projected by applying the variable interest rates effective at December 31, 2017. \nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (124,940\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (201,049\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (161,427\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 126,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 129,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Decrease) Increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (16,380\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (22,061\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue Recognition\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2017 Calendar Quarters\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> First\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Second\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Third\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fourth\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands, except per share amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 115,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 116,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 117,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 116,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Loss) Income from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,610\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss and comprehensive loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21,842\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,835\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,132\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,359\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss per share, basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.75\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.27\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.28\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.22\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss per share, diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.75\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.27\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.28\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.22\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average shares outstanding, basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average shares outstanding, fully diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nLong-Lived Assets\nRecently Issued Accounting Guidance\nOn December 1, 2017, the Company renewed certain insurance policies and entered into a finance agreement totaling approximately $3.5 million. The finance agreement has a fixed interest rate of 3.04% with the principal being repaid over an 11-month term.\nExcluding the two senior housing communities impacted by Hurricane Harvey, the weighted average financial occupancy rate for each of our consolidated and same-store communities for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was 86.8% and 87.9%, respectively. Although each of our consolidated and same-store occupancies declined, we achieved an increase in average monthly rental rates at our consolidated and same-store communities when comparing fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2016 of 3.3% and 2.8%, respectively. The increase in average monthly rental rates during fiscal 2017 was primarily the result of our recent senior housing community acquisitions, annual rent increases for our existing residents, and the capital improvements we have invested in our communities for unit conversions which enable us to provide a broader range of senior living services at higher levels of care.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company leased 7 senior housing communities (collectively the Ventas Lease Agreements\u201d) from Ventas, Inc. ( Ventas\u201d). Effective January 31, 2017, the Company closed the Four Property Lease Transaction and acquired from Ventas the underlying real estate associated with four of its operating leases for a total acquisition price of $85.0 million. The Company obtained interim, interest only, bridge financing from Berkadia for $65.0 million of the acquisition price with an initial variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 4.0% and a 36-month term, with the balance of the acquisition price paid from the Company's existing cash resources. For additional information refer to Note 3, Acquisitions\u201d, within the notes to consolidated financial statements. Prior to the Four Property Lease Transaction, the Company previously leased 11 senior housing communities from Ventas.\nIn summary, the Company's cash flows were as follows (in thousands):\n (6) On April 24, 2015, the Company exercised its right to extend the lease terms with HCP through April 30, 2026, with one 10-year renewal extension remaining available at the Company's option. \nIn January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2017-01, Business Combinations - Clarifying the Definition of a Business. ASU 2017-01 provides guidance in accounting for business combinations when determining if the transaction represents acquisitions or disposals of assets or of a business. Under ASU 2017-01, when determining whether an integrated set of assets and activities constitutes a business, entities must compare the fair value of gross assets acquired to the fair value of a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in the single identifiable assets or group of similar identifiable assets, the integrated set of assets and activities is not characterized as a business. ASU 2017-01 is applied prospectively and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. Management does not expect the adoption of ASU 2017-01 to have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nTo date, inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company. However, inflation could affect the Company's future revenues and results of operations because of, among other things, the Company's dependence on senior residents, many of whom rely primarily on fixed incomes to pay for the Company's services. As a result, during inflationary periods, the Company may not be able to increase resident service fees to account fully for increased operating expenses. In structuring its fees, the Company attempts to anticipate inflation levels, but there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to anticipate fully or otherwise respond to any future inflationary pressures.\nLease Accounting\nThe Company had two of its senior housing communities located in southeast Texas impacted by Hurricane Harvey during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Both of these communities remain fully vacated and are undergoing repairs. We maintain insurance coverage on these communities which includes damage caused by flooding. The insurance claim for this incident required a deductible of $100,000 that was expensed as a component of operating expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Through December 31, 2017, we have incurred approximately $3.9 million in clean-up and physical repair costs and we expect to incur additional repair costs which we believe are probable of being recovered through insurance proceeds. In addition to the repairs of physical damage to the buildings, the Company's insurance coverage includes loss of business income ( Business Interruption\u201d). Business Interruption includes reimbursement for lost revenue as well as incremental expenses incurred as a result of the hurricane. The Company received payments from our insurance underwriters during fiscal 2017 totaling approximately $2.7 million of which approximately $2.2 million related to Business Interruption through December 31, 2017, which has been included as a reduction to operating expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss in fiscal 2017. Based upon our initial assessment of the physical damages and insurance coverage, the Company currently estimates insurance proceeds will be sufficient to reimburse the Company for all damages and repair costs to fully restore the communities to their condition prior to the incident.\nPurchase Accounting\n \u2022 The $12.9 million loss on facility lease termination is due to the Four Property Lease Transaction that closed on January 31, 2017, whereby the Company acquired the underlying real estate associated with four of the senior housing communities previously leased from Ventas. For additional information, refer to Note 3, Acquisitions\u201d, within the notes to consolidated financial statements. \nThe Company had net cash used in investing activities of $124.9 million, $201.0 million, and $161.4 million in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2017 primarily results from capital expenditures of $40.0 million associated with ongoing capital renovations and refurbishments at the Company's senior housing communities and the acquisition of senior housing communities by the Company of $85.0 million. The net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2016 primarily results from capital expenditures of $62.4 million and acquisitions of senior housing communities by the Company of $138.8 million. The net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2015 primarily results from capital expenditures of $42.4 million and acquisitions of senior housing communities by the Company of $162.5 million, partially offset by proceeds from the Sedgwick Sale Transaction and Four Property Sale Transaction of $43.5 million.\n (4) Effective June 17, 2015, the Company executed amendments to the master lease agreements with Ventas to facilitate leasehold improvements for 10 of the leased communities, of which the underlying real estate associated with four of its operating leases was acquired by the Company upon closing the Four Property Lease Transaction on January 31, 2017, and extend the lease terms through September 30, 2025, with two five-year renewal extensions available at the Company's option. \n \u2022 The increase in operating expenses primarily results from an increase of $21.2 million from the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2016, a full year of activity for the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2015, and an increase of $6.0 million at the Company's same-store communities primarily due to increased wages and benefits to employees for annual merit increases as well as the incremental costs to support changes in occupancy mix with more of our residents at higher levels of care, partially offset by a decrease of $2.0 million due to the Sedgwick Sale Transaction and Four Property Sale Transaction each of which closed in fiscal 2015. \nResident revenue was $447.4 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $412.2 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, representing an increase of $35.3 million, or 8.6%. The increase in resident revenue primarily results from an increase of $31.0 million from the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2016 and a full year of activity for the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2015 and an increase of $6.8 million due to a 2.0% increase in average monthly rental rates at the Company's same-store communities, slightly offset by a decrease of $2.6 million due to the Company's sale of one of its senior housing communities located in Wichita, Kansas, (the Sedgwick Sale Transaction\u201d) and the Company's sale of four senior housing communities located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Shreveport, Louisiana, Southfield, Michigan, and Winston-Salem, North Carolina (the Four Property Sale Transaction\u201d), each of which closed in fiscal 2015.\nOverview\nNet loss and comprehensive loss\n (3) Deferred gains of $34.5 million and lease concessions of $2.6 million are being recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss as a reduction in facility lease expense over the respective initial lease term. Lease concessions of $0.6 million relate to the transaction with HCP on May 31, 2006, and $2.0 million relate to the transaction with Welltower on September 10, 2010. \nExpenses\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, selected historical Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss data in thousands of dollars and expressed as a percentage of total revenues.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance for workers' compensation. Determining the reserve for workers' compensation losses and costs that the Company has incurred as of the end of a reporting period involves significant judgments based on projected future events, including potential settlements for pending claims, known incidents which may result in claims, estimates of incurred but not yet reported claims, changes in insurance premiums, estimated litigation costs and other factors. The Company regularly adjusts these estimates to reflect changes in the foregoing factors. However, since this reserve is based on estimates, the actual expenses incurred may differ from the amounts reserved. Any subsequent changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they are determined.\nEmployee Health and Dental Benefits, Workers' Compensation, and Insurance Reserves\n\nProvision for income taxes\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company leased 46 senior housing communities from certain real estate investment trusts ( REITs\u201d). The lease terms are generally for 10-15 years with renewal options for 5-20 years at the Company's option. Under these lease agreements, the Company is responsible for all operating costs, maintenance and repairs, insurance and property taxes. No new facility leases were entered into by the Company during fiscal 2017.\nCertain information contained in this report constitutes Forward-Looking Statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as may,\u201d will,\u201d would,\u201d intend,\u201d could,\u201d believe,\u201d expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d estimate\u201d or continue\u201d or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology. The Company cautions readers that forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those relating to the Company's future business prospects, revenues, working capital, liquidity, capital needs, interest costs, and income, are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, due to several important factors herein identified. These factors include the Company's ability to find suitable acquisition properties at favorable terms, financing, licensing, business conditions, risks of downturn in economic conditions generally, satisfaction of closing conditions such as those pertaining to licensure, availability of insurance at commercially reasonable rates, and changes in accounting principles and interpretations, among others, and other risks and factors identified from time to time in the Company's reports filed with the SEC.\nOn December 15, 2017, the Company completed supplemental mortgage financing of approximately $4.1 million from Fannie Mae at a fixed interest rate of 5.71% on one community located in Oneonta, New York. The supplemental mortgage loan is coterminous, cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with the original existing mortgage debt maturing in June 2025.\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. At each balance sheet date, the Company reviews the carrying value of its property and equipment to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that they may be impaired or that the depreciation period may need to be changed. The Company considers internal factors such as net operating losses along with external factors relating to each asset, including contract changes, local market developments, and other publicly available information. If an indicator of impairment is identified, the carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair market value, generally based on discounted cash\n (2) Reflects future minimum lease commitments under the Company's various property and equipment lease agreements at current rental rates. \nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company leased 15 senior housing communities (collectively the HCP Lease Agreements\u201d) from HCP, Inc. ( HCP\u201d). During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company executed an amendment to the master lease agreement with HCP to facilitate up to $3.3 million of leasehold improvements for one community within the HCP lease portfolio and extend the initial lease terms for nine communities until October 31, 2020, with two 10-year renewal extensions available at the Company's option. During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company exercised its right to extend the lease term with HCP for the remaining six communities in the HCP lease portfolio until April 30, 2026, with one 10-year renewal extension available at the Company's option. The initial lease rates under the HCP Lease Agreements ranged from 7.25% to 8% and are subject to certain conditional escalation clauses, which will be recognized when probable or incurred. The Company incurred $1.6 million in lease acquisition and modification costs related to the HCP Lease Agreements. These deferred lease acquisition and modification costs are being amortized over the lease terms and are included in facility lease expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company accounts for each of the HCP Lease Agreements as an operating lease.\nThe following discussion and analysis addresses (i) the Company's results of operations on a historical consolidated basis for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, and (ii) liquidity and capital resources of the Company and should be read in conjunction with the Company's historical consolidated financial statements and the selected financial data contained elsewhere in this report.\n\n\nThe following table provides the amounts due under specified contractual obligations for the periods indicated as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\n \u2022 The decrease in facility lease expense primarily results from the Four Property Lease Transaction that closed on January 31, 2017. \nAs a result of the foregoing factors, the Company reported net loss and comprehensive loss of $(28.0 million) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, compared to net loss and comprehensive loss of $(14.3 million) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting. ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in ASU 2016-09 are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-09 on January 1, 2017, and incorporated the provisions of this update into its consolidated financial statements upon adoption. Upon adoption, the Company elected to change its accounting policy to account for forfeitures as they occur. This change was applied on a modified retrospective basis with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of $0.2 million. Additionally, the adoption of ASU 2016-09 resulted in the Company recording an adjustment of $5.3 million, which resulted in an increase to the Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowance, to recognize net operating loss carryforwards attributable to excess tax benefits on stock compensation that had not been previously recognized to additional paid in capital. Excess tax benefits for share-based payments are now included in net operating activities rather than net financing activities within the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, these reporting changes have been applied prospectively and prior periods have not been adjusted.\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td>\nThe Company issued standby letters of credit with Chase, totaling approximately $2.9 million, for the benefit of HCP on certain leases between HCP and the Company.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \u2022 The increase in stock-based compensation expense results from the accelerated vesting of restricted stock awards for severance benefits associated with the passing of the Company's Chief Operating Officer in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company granting additional shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units to certain employees and directors of the Company during fiscal 2016, some of which required accelerated expense recognition, and a full year of amortization for restricted stock awards and units granted during fiscal 2015. \nITEM 7.\nOther income and expense\nChanges in the current economic environment could result in decreases in the fair value of assets, slowing of transactions, and tightening liquidity and credit markets. These impacts could make securing debt for acquisitions or refinancings for the Company, its joint ventures, or buyers of the Company's properties more difficult or on terms not acceptable to the Company. Additionally, the Company may be more susceptible to being negatively impacted by operating or performance deficits based on the exposure associated with certain lease coverage requirements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. ASU 2016-02 amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. ASU 2016-02 will be effective beginning in 2019. Early adoption of ASU 2016-02 as of its issuance is permitted. The new leases standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new leases standard on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). ASU 2016-18 requires an entity to include in its cash and cash-equivalent balances in the statement of cash flows those amounts that are deemed to be restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. ASU 2016-18 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Management does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-18 to have a material impact on the Company's cash flows.\nSignificant Financial and Operational Highlights\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOn January 31, 2017, in conjunction with the Four Property Lease Transaction, the Company obtained $65.0 million of mortgage debt from Berkadia. The new mortgage loan is interest-only and has a three-year term with an initial variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 4.00%.\nResident revenue is recognized at estimated net realizable amounts, based on historical experiences, due from residents in the period to which the rental and other services are provided. Additionally, substantially all community fees received from residents are non-refundable and are recorded initially by the Company as deferred revenue. The deferred amounts are amortized over the respective residents' initial lease term which is consistent with the contractual obligation associated with the estimated stay of the resident.\n\n \u2022 Interest expense increased $7.3 million in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to an increase of $2.0 million from a full year of activity for the additional mortgage debt associated with the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2016 and an increase of $5.2 million at the Company's same-store communities due to the Four Property Lease Transaction that closed on January 31, 2017, additional mortgage debt for supplemental loans obtained by the Company during fiscal 2017, and a full year of activity for certain refinancings and supplemental loans obtained by the Company during fiscal 2016. \nOperating Activities\nResults of Operations\nThe Company offers certain full-time employees an option to participate in its health and dental plans. The Company is self-insured up to certain limits and is insured if claims in excess of these limits are incurred. The cost of employee health and dental benefits, net of employee contributions, is shared between the corporate office and the senior housing communities based on the respective number of plan participants. Funds collected are used to pay the actual program costs including estimated annual claims, third-party administrative fees, network provider fees, communication costs, and other related administrative costs incurred by the plans. Claims are paid as they are submitted to the Company's third-party administrator. The Company records a liability for outstanding claims and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. This liability is based on the historical claim reporting lag and payment trends of health insurance claims. Management believes that the liability for outstanding losses and expenses is adequate to cover the ultimate cost of losses and expenses incurred at December 31, 2017; however, actual claims and expenses may differ. Any subsequent changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they are determined.\n \u2022 Interest expense increased $6.5 million in fiscal 2016 when compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to an increase of $5.0 million from the additional mortgage debt associated with the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2016 and a full year of interest for the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2015 and an increase of $1.7 million at the Company's consolidated same-store communities due to additional mortgage debt added by the Company associated with supplemental loans that occurred during fiscal 2016 and a full year of activity for certain refinancing's and supplemental loans that occurred during fiscal 2015, slightly offset by a decrease of $0.2 million due to the Sedgwick Sale Transaction and Four Property Sale Transaction each of which closed in fiscal 2015. \nIn addition to approximately $17.6 million of unrestricted cash balances on hand as of December 31, 2017, the Company's principal sources of liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operations, supplemental debt financings, additional proceeds from debt refinancings, equity issuances, and/or proceeds from the sale of assets. The Company expects its available cash and cash flows from operations, supplemental debt financings, additional proceeds from debt refinancings, and proceeds from the sale of assets to be sufficient to fund its short-term working capital requirements. The Company's long-term capital requirements, primarily for acquisitions and other corporate initiatives, could be dependent on its ability to access additional funds through joint ventures and the debt and/or equity markets. The Company from time to time considers and evaluates transactions related to its portfolio including supplemental debt financings, debt refinancings, equity issuances, purchases and sales of assets, reorganizations and other transactions. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that the Company will be able to obtain the capital necessary to meet the Company's short and long-term capital requirements.\nThe fair value of acquired lease-related intangibles reflects the estimated fair value of existing resident in-place leases as represented by the cost to obtain residents and an estimated absorption period to reflect the value of the rent and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease-up period as if the property acquired was vacant. The Company amortizes any acquired resident in-place lease intangibles to depreciation and amortization expense over the estimated remaining useful life of the respective resident operating leases.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company leased 24 senior housing communities (collectively the Welltower Lease Agreements\u201d) from Welltower, Inc., formerly Health Care REIT, Inc. ( Welltower\u201d). The Welltower Lease Agreements each have an initial term of 15 years, with one 15-year renewal extension available at the Company's option. The initial lease rates under the Welltower Lease Agreements ranged from 7.25% to 8.5% and are subject to certain conditional escalation clauses, which will be recognized when probable or incurred. The initial terms on the Welltower Lease Agreements expire on various dates through April 2026. The Company incurred $2.1 million in lease acquisition costs related to the Welltower Lease Agreements. These deferred lease acquisition costs are being amortized over the lease terms and are included in facility lease expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company accounts for each of the Welltower Lease Agreements as an operating lease.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15 amends the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 230, which often requires judgment to determine the appropriate classification of cash flows as operating, investing or financing activities and has resulted in diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are classified. ASU 2016-15 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and should be applied on a retrospective basis. Management does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-15 to have a material impact on the Company's cash flows.\n \u2022 Other income in fiscal 2016 primarily represents payments received by the Company associated with certain legal settlements. \nThe Company primarily derives its revenue by providing senior living housing and services to the elderly. When comparing fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2016, the Company generated total revenues of approximately $467.0 million compared to total revenues of approximately $447.4 million, respectively, representing an increase of approximately $19.5 million, or 4.4%. The increase in revenues primarily results from a full year of activity for the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2016 which resulted in an increase in revenue of approximately $15.3 million and we experienced an increase in revenue at our same-store communities of approximately $4.3 million. The increase in revenue at our same-store communities during fiscal 2017 was negatively impacted by Hurricane Harvey which resulted in the full evacuation of our residents at two of our senior housing communities located in southeast Texas. Both of these communities are undergoing repairs and remain fully vacated which resulted in a decrease of approximately $3.5 million in our same-store revenue during fiscal 2017.\nProvision for income taxes for fiscal 2017 was $2.5 million, or 6.0% of loss before income taxes, compared to a provision for income taxes of $0.4 million, or 1.6% of loss before income taxes, for fiscal 2016. The effective tax rates for fiscal 2017 and 2016 differ from the statutory tax rates due to state income taxes, permanent tax differences, and changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. The Company is impacted by the Texas Margin Tax ( TMT\u201d), which effectively imposes tax on modified gross revenues for communities within the State of Texas. During each of fiscal 2017 and 2016, the Company consolidated 38 Texas communities and the TMT increased the overall provision for income taxes. The increase in provision for income taxes for fiscal 2017 was attributable to an increase of $0.2 million for higher state income taxes with the remaining $1.9 million due to recent tax legislation changes associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( TCJA\u201d), which was enacted on December 22, 2017.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related notes. Management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience, observance of industry trends and various other sources of information and factors, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The Company believes the following are our most critical accounting policies and/or typically require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.\nManagement regularly evaluates the future realization of deferred tax assets and provides a valuation allowance, if considered necessary, based on such evaluation. As part of the evaluation, management has evaluated taxable income in carryback years, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, feasible tax planning strategies, and future expectations of income. Based upon this evaluation, adjustments to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $5.9 million and $8.6 million were recorded during fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, to reduce the Company's net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nFacility Leases\n (2) Lease acquisition and modification costs are being amortized over the respective lease terms. \n \u2022 The increase in operating expenses primarily results from an increase of $11.6 million from a full year of activity for the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2016 and an increase of $5.2 million at the Company's same-store communities primarily due to increased wages and benefits to employees for annual merit increases and incremental costs, including increased labor costs for additional staffing required for newly licensed memory care and assisted living units, to support changes in occupancy with more of our residents at higher levels of care. The increase in operating expenses at our same-store communities included a reduction of $2.2 million for insurance proceeds the Company received to cover Business Interruption through December 31, 2017, for the period the two communities located in southeast Texas were unoccupied due to Hurricane Harvey. \nDebt Transactions\nProvision for income taxes\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, the Company reported net loss and comprehensive loss of $(44.2 million) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, compared to net loss and comprehensive loss of $(28.0 million) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.\n \u2022 The increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily results from an increase of $3.4 million from a full year of activity for the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2016 and an increase of $8.7 million due to an increase in depreciable assets at the Company's same-store communities, partially offset by a decrease in in-place lease amortization of $6.3 million from senior housing communities acquired by the Company prior to fiscal 2016. \nTotal expenses were $459.2 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $433.1 million during fiscal 2016, representing an increase of $26.1 million, or 6.0%. This increase is primarily the result of a $16.8 million increase in operating expenses, a $12.9 million loss on facility lease termination, and a $5.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, slightly offset by a $5.3 million decrease in facility lease expense and a $4.0 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense.\n \u2022 Gain on disposition of assets in fiscal 2015 is primarily attributable to the Sedgwick Sale Transaction, slightly offset with final closing cost adjustments associated with the Four Property Sale Transaction. \nIn determining the allocation of the purchase price of senior housing communities acquired to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, the Company makes estimates of fair value using information obtained as a result of pre-acquisition due diligence, leasing activities and/or independent appraisals. The Company assigns the purchase price for senior living communities to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values which are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations. The determination of fair value involves the use of significant judgments and estimates which is generally assessed as follows:\nThe Company issued standby letters of credit with JPMorgan Chase Bank ( Chase\u201d), totaling approximately $6.7 million, for the benefit of Welltower, on certain leases between Welltower and the Company.\nThe Company had no material off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2017.\nInvesting Activities\nFinancing Activities\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\n \u2022 The decrease in stock-based compensation expense results from the accelerated vesting of restricted stock awards for severance benefits associated with the passing of the Company's Chief Operating Officer in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company granting fewer shares of restricted stock to certain employees of the Company during fiscal 2017. \nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company executed amendments to the master lease agreements with Ventas to facilitate up to $24.5 million of leasehold improvements for 10 communities within the Ventas lease portfolio and extend the lease terms until September 30, 2025, with two five-year renewal extensions available at the Company's option. During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company executed amendments to the master lease agreements with Ventas to increase the Special Project Funds for leasehold improvements from $24.5 million to $28.5 million and extend the date for completion of the leasehold improvements to June 30, 2017. During fiscal 2017, the Company executed amendments to the master lease agreements with Ventas to decrease the Special Project Funds for leasehold improvements from $28.5 million to approximately $17.0 million due to the Four Property Lease Transaction and extend the date for completion of the leasehold improvements to June 30, 2018. The initial lease rates under each of the Ventas Lease Agreements ranged from 6.75% to 8% and are subject to certain conditional escalation clauses which will be recognized when probable or incurred. The Company initially incurred $11.4 million in lease acquisition and modification costs related to the Ventas Lease Agreements, of which a portion of these costs were written-off upon closing the Four Property Lease Transaction leaving $8.7 million in lease acquisition and modification costs associated with the remaining properties. These deferred lease acquisition and modification costs are being amortized over the lease terms and are included in facility lease expense in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company accounts for five of the Ventas Lease Agreements as an operating lease and two as a capital lease and financing obligation.\nOn November 30, 2017, the Company completed supplemental mortgage financing of approximately $3.0 million from Fannie Mae at a fixed interest rate of 5.49% on one community located in Rocky River, Ohio. The supplemental mortgage loan is coterminous, cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with the original existing mortgage debt maturing in January 2023.\nEffective January 31, 2017, the Company acquired the underlying real estate associated with four of the senior housing communities previously leased from Ventas, Inc. ( Ventas\u201d) for an acquisition price of $85.0 million (the Four Property Lease Transaction\u201d). The Company obtained interest only, bridge financing from Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC ( Berkadia\u201d) for $65.0 million of the acquisition price with an initial variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 4.0% and a 36-month term, with the balance of the acquisition price paid from the Company's existing cash resources. For additional information refer to Note 3, Acquisitions\u201d, within the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nTotal expenses were $433.1 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $393.3 million during fiscal 2015, representing an increase of $39.7 million, or 10.1%. This increase in expenses is primarily the result of a $25.2 million increase in operating expenses, a $7.4 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, a $3.3 million increase in general and administrative expenses, a $2.8 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, a $0.5 million increase in provision for bad debts, and a $0.5 million increase in facility lease expense.\nRevenues\nNet loss and comprehensive loss\n \u2022 Interest income generally reflects interest earned on the investment of cash balances and escrowed funds or interest associated with certain income tax refunds or property tax settlements. \nThe following table presents certain unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the four quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. This information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company appearing elsewhere in this report and include, in the opinion of the Company's management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the quarterly results when read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and the related notes thereto.\nLaws and regulations governing the Medicaid program are complex and subject to interpretation. The Company believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and is not aware of any pending or threatened investigations involving allegations of potential wrongdoing. While no such regulatory inquiries have been made, compliance with such laws and regulations can be subject to future government review and interpretation as well as significant regulatory action including fines, penalties, and exclusion from the Medicaid program.\n \u2022 The increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily results from an increase of $11.1 million from senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2016 and a full year of activity for the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2015 and an increase of $4.0 million due to an increase in depreciable assets at the Company's same-store communities, partially offset by a decrease in in-place lease amortization of $7.4 million from senior housing communities acquired by the Company prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and a decrease of $0.3 million due to the Sedgwick Sale Transaction and Four Property Sale Transaction each of which closed in fiscal 2015. \nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nExpenses\n</td> </tr>\nflows, of the long-lived asset. The Company does not believe there are any indicators of impairment that would require an adjustment to the carrying value of the property and equipment or their remaining useful lives as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe Company had net cash provided by financing activities of $53.0 million, $126.7 million, and $129.4 million in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2017 primarily results from notes payable proceeds of $77.2 million, of which $65.0 million is related to new mortgage debt associated with the acquisition of senior housing communities by the Company, approximately $7.1 million related to supplemental mortgage debt obtained on the Company's existing owned senior housing communities, and approximately $5.1 million related to insurance premium financing, partially offset by repayments of notes payable of $20.1 million, payments on capital lease and financing obligations of $2.9 million, and deferred financing charges paid of $1.2 million associated with the acquisition of senior housing communities by the Company. The net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2016 primarily results from notes payable proceeds of $150.8 million, of which approximately $101.5 million is related to new mortgage debt associated with the acquisition of senior housing communities by the Company, approximately $44.4 million related to supplemental mortgage debt obtained on existing senior housing communities, and approximately $4.9 million related to insurance premium financing, partially offset by repayments of notes payable of $17.7 million, purchases of treasury stock of $2.5 million, deferred financing charges paid of $2.5 million, and payments on capital lease and financing obligations of $1.3 million. The net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2015 primarily results from notes payable proceeds of $250.9 million, of which approximately $118.1 million is related to new mortgage debt associated with the acquisition of senior housing communities by the Company, approximately $2.2 million related to insurance premium financing, and the remaining $130.6 million resulted from supplemental financings, mortgage refinancings, or new mortgage debt obtained on existing unencumbered senior housing communities, partially offset by repayments of notes payable of $115.9 million, deferred financing charges paid of $3.8 million, payments on capital lease and financing obligations of $1.0 million, and additions to restricted cash of $0.9 million.\n\n \u2022 Write-off of deferred loan costs and prepayment premiums in fiscal 2015 is primarily attributable to the early repayment of certain mortgage debt on the Company's owned senior housing communities due to scheduled maturities and the opportunity to replace interim variable interest rate debt with long-term fixed interest rate financing. \nOn May 31, 2017, the Company renewed certain insurance policies and entered into a finance agreement totaling approximately $1.6 million. The finance agreement has a fixed interest rate of 2.76% with the principal being repaid over an 11-month term.\nThe Company is one of the largest operators of senior housing communities in the United States. The Company's operating strategy is to provide value to its senior living residents by providing quality senior living services at reasonable prices, while achieving and sustaining a strong, competitive position within its geographically concentrated regions, as well as continuing to enhance the performance of its operations. The Company provides senior living services to the elderly, including independent living, assisted living, and memory care services at reasonable prices. Many of the Company's communities offer a continuum of care to meet its residents' needs as they change over time. This continuum of care, which integrates independent living, assisted living, and memory care, and is bridged by home care through independent home care agencies, sustains residents' autonomy and independence based on their physical and mental abilities.\n \u2022 Interest income generally reflects interest earned on the investment of cash balances and escrowed funds or interest associated with certain income tax refunds or property tax settlements. \nThe Company determines whether to account for its leases as operating, capital or financing leases depending on the underlying terms of each lease agreement. This determination of classification requires significant judgment relating to certain information, including the estimated fair value and remaining economic life of the community, the Company's cost of funds, minimum lease payments and other lease terms. The lease rates under the Company's lease agreements are subject to certain conditional escalation clauses which are recognized when probable or incurred and are based on changes in the consumer price index or certain operational performance measures. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company leased 46 and 50 communities, respectively, two of which the Company classified as capital lease and financing obligations with the remaining classified as operating leases. The Company incurs lease acquisition costs and amortizes these costs over the term of the respective lease agreement. Certain leases entered into by the Company qualified as sale/leaseback transactions, and as such, any related gains have been deferred and are being amortized over the respective lease term. No new communities were leased by the Company during fiscal 2017 or 2016. Effective January 31, 2017, the Company acquired from Ventas the underlying real estate associated with four of its operating leases. For additional information refer to Note 3, Acquisitions\u201d, within the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nResident revenue was $467.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $447.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $19.5 million, or 4.4%. The increase in resident revenue primarily results from an increase of $15.3 million from a full year of activity for the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2016 and an increase of $4.3 million due to a 2.8% increase in average monthly rental rates at the Company's same-store communities which was primarily the result of annual rent increases for our existing residents and recent capital improvements we have invested in our communities for unit conversions which enable us to provide a broader range of senior living services at higher levels of care. The increase in resident revenue at our same-store communities was negatively impacted by Hurricane Harvey which resulted in the full evacuation of our residents at two of our communities located in southeast Texas. Both of these communities are undergoing repairs and remain fully vacated which resulted in a decrease in our same-store resident revenue of approximately $3.5 million.\n \u2022 The increase in general and administrative expenses primarily results from an increase of $1.8 million in employee insurance benefits and claims paid, which resulted in higher health insurance costs to the Company, an increase of $1.1 million for severance benefits associated with the passing of the Company's Chief Operating Officer in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, and an increase of $0.4 million in wages and benefits for existing employee annual merit increases and additional employees hired during fiscal 2016. \nCredit Risk and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe following table summarizes each of the Company's facility lease agreements as of December 31, 2017 (dollars in millions):\nOn November 30, 2017, the Company completed supplemental mortgage financing of approximately $3.0 million from Fannie Mae at a fixed interest rate of 5.49% on one community located in Rocky River, Ohio. The supplemental mortgage loan is coterminous, cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with the original existing mortgage debt maturing in January 2023.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets. Under ASU 2014-09, an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company has evaluated the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures. Based on our assessment, we do not believe it will have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company is planning to adopt the standard under the modified retrospective adoption.\nLong-term debt relates to the aggregate maturities of the Company's notes payable. As of December 31, 2017, the Company leases its corporate headquarters in Dallas, an executive office in New York, 46 senior housing communities and certain equipment used at the Company's communities.\nThe Company allocates the fair values of buildings acquired on an as-if-vacant basis and depreciates the building values over the estimated remaining lives of the buildings, not to exceed 40 years. The Company determines the allocated values of other fixed assets, such as site improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment, based upon the replacement cost and depreciates such values over the assets' estimated remaining useful lives as determined at the acquisition date. The Company determines the value of land by considering the sales prices of similar properties in recent transactions.\n (5) On November 11, 2013, the Company executed an amendment to the master lease agreement associated with nine of its leased communities with HCP to facilitate leasehold improvements for one of the leased communities and extend the respective lease terms through October 31, 2020, with two 10-year renewal extensions available at the Company's option. \nOther income and expense\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\n \u2022 Other income in fiscal 2016 represents payments received by the Company associated with certain legal settlements. \nThe Company had net cash provided by operating activities of $55.6 million, $52.3 million, and $48.9 million in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2017 primarily results from net non-cash charges of $96.0 million, a decrease in other assets of $4.1 million, an increase in other liabilities of $5.0 million, and an increase in accounts payable of $2.8 million, and in increase in accrued expenses of $1.7 million, partially offset by net loss of $(44.2 million), an increase in accounts receivable of $8.2 million, and a decrease in deferred resident revenue of $1.9 million. The net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2016 primarily results from net non-cash charges of $82.1 million, an increase in accrued expenses of $4.8 million and an increase in accounts payable of $1.7 million, partially offset by net loss of $(28.0 million), an increase in accounts receivable of $2.5 million, an increase in other assets of $2.2 million, an increase in prepaid expenses of $2.0 million, and a decrease in deferred resident revenue of $1.1 million. The net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2015 primarily results from net non-cash charges of $63.8 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses of $2.4 million, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $3.0 million, and an increase in deferred resident rent and customer deposits of $0.5 million, partially offset by net loss of $(14.3 million), an increase in accounts receivable of $2.9 million, an increase in property tax and insurance deposits of $2.2 million, and an increase in other assets of $1.3 million.\n (1) Initial lease rates are measured against agreed upon fair market values and are subject to conditional lease escalation provisions as set forth in each respective lease agreement. \n \u2022 The increase in facility lease expense primarily results from contingent annual rental rate escalations for certain existing facility leases. \nDisclosures About Contractual Obligations\nThe Company evaluates uncertain tax positions through consideration of accounting and reporting guidance on criteria, measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition that is intended to provide better financial-statement comparability among different companies. The Company is required to recognize a tax benefit in its financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management's assessment is that its position is more likely than not\u201d (i.e., a greater than 50 percent likelihood) to be upheld on audit based only on the technical merits of the tax position. The Company's policy is to recognize interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and penalties as income tax expense. The Company is generally no longer subject to federal and state income tax audits for years prior to 2014.", "item_7_text": "Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method and current income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year. Deferred income taxes are recorded based on the estimated future tax effects of loss carryforwards and temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect those carryforwards and temporary differences to be recovered or settled. Management regularly evaluates the future realization of deferred tax assets and provides a valuation allowance, if considered necessary, based on such evaluation. As part of the evaluation, management has evaluated taxable income in carryback years, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, feasible tax planning strategies, and future expectations of income. Based upon this evaluation, a valuation allowance has been recorded to reduce the Company's net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. However, in the event that we were to determine that it would be more likely than not that the Company would realize the benefit of deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amounts, adjustments to deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period we made such a determination. The benefits of the net deferred tax assets might not be realized if actual results differ from expectations. The effective tax rates for fiscal 2017 and 2016 differ from the statutory tax rates due to state income taxes, permanent tax differences, and changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. The Company is impacted by the Texas Margin Tax ( TMT\u201d), which effectively imposes tax on modified gross revenues for communities within the State of Texas. During each of fiscal 2017 and 2016, the Company consolidated 38 Texas communities and the TMT increased the overall provision for income taxes.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company operated 129 senior housing communities in 23 states with an aggregate capacity of approximately 16,500 residents, including 83 senior housing communities which the Company owned and 46 senior housing communities the Company leased.\nIncome Taxes\nProvision for income taxes for fiscal 2016 was $0.4 million, or 1.6% of loss before provision for income taxes, compared to a provision for income taxes of $0.9 million, or 6.7% of loss before provision for income taxes, for fiscal 2015. The effective tax rates for fiscal 2016 and 2015 differ from the statutory tax rates due to state income taxes, permanent tax differences, and changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. During fiscal 2015, the Company incurred $0.3 million in additional income taxes due to the taxable gain realized from the Four Property Sale Transaction. For income tax purposes, in conjunction with the Sedgwick Sale Transaction that closed in fiscal 2015 the Company executed a like-kind exchange and acquired a replacement property shortly after the sale which resulted in deferral of the gain without the Company incurring any current federal or state income tax liabilities. The Company is impacted by the TMT, which effectively imposes tax on modified gross revenues for communities within the State of Texas. During fiscal 2016 and 2015, the Company consolidated 38 and 37 Texas communities, respectively, and the TMT increased the overall provision for income taxes. Management regularly evaluates the future realization of deferred tax assets and provides a valuation allowance, if considered necessary, based on such evaluation. As part of the evaluation, management has evaluated taxable income in carryback years, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, feasible tax planning strategies, and future expectations of income. Based upon this evaluation, adjustments to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $8.6 million and $5.0 million were recorded during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, to reduce the Company's net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nQuarterly Results\nRevenues from the Medicaid program accounted for approximately 5.6% of the Company's revenue in fiscal 2017, 5.5% of the Company's revenue in fiscal 2016, and 4.6% of the Company's revenue in fiscal 2015. During fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, 41, 40, and 34, respectively, of the Company's communities were providers of services under Medicaid programs. Accordingly, these communities were entitled to reimbursement under the foregoing program at established rates that were lower than private pay rates. Patient service revenue for Medicaid patients was recorded at the reimbursement rates as the rates were set prospectively by the applicable state upon the filing of an annual cost report. None of the Company's communities were providers of services under the Medicare program during fiscal 2017, 2016, or 2015.\nFacility lease expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss includes rent expense plus amortization expense relating to leasehold acquisition costs offset by the amortization of deferred gains and lease incentives. There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in the Company's lease agreements. The Company was in compliance with all of its lease covenants at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nFacility lease expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive loss includes rent expense plus amortization expense relating to leasehold acquisition costs offset by the amortization of deferred gains and lease incentives.\n</table>\nOn December 15, 2017, the Company completed supplemental mortgage financing of approximately $4.1 million from Fannie Mae at a fixed interest rate of 5.71% on one community located in Oneonta, New York. The supplemental mortgage loan is coterminous, cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with the original existing mortgage debt maturing in June 2025.\nThe Company's resident receivables are generally due within 30 days from the date billed. Accounts receivable are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $4.9 million and $4.3 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and represent the Company's estimate of the amount that ultimately will be collected. The adequacy of the Company's allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on an ongoing basis, using historical payment trends, write-off experience, analyses of receivable portfolios by payor source and aging of receivables, as well as a review of specific accounts, and adjustments are made to the allowance as necessary. Credit losses on resident receivables have historically been within management's estimates, and management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts adequately provides for expected losses.\nThe Company issued standby letters of credit with Wells Fargo Bank ( Wells Fargo\u201d), totaling approximately $3.9 million, for the benefit of Hartford Financial Services ( Hartford\u201d) associated with the administration of workers compensation.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\n (1) Amounts due associated with our variable rate mortgage debt is projected by applying the variable interest rates effective at December 31, 2017. \nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues\nLong-Lived Assets\nRecently Issued Accounting Guidance\nOn December 1, 2017, the Company renewed certain insurance policies and entered into a finance agreement totaling approximately $3.5 million. The finance agreement has a fixed interest rate of 3.04% with the principal being repaid over an 11-month term.\nExcluding the two senior housing communities impacted by Hurricane Harvey, the weighted average financial occupancy rate for each of our consolidated and same-store communities for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was 86.8% and 87.9%, respectively. Although each of our consolidated and same-store occupancies declined, we achieved an increase in average monthly rental rates at our consolidated and same-store communities when comparing fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2016 of 3.3% and 2.8%, respectively. The increase in average monthly rental rates during fiscal 2017 was primarily the result of our recent senior housing community acquisitions, annual rent increases for our existing residents, and the capital improvements we have invested in our communities for unit conversions which enable us to provide a broader range of senior living services at higher levels of care.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company leased 7 senior housing communities (collectively the Ventas Lease Agreements\u201d) from Ventas, Inc. ( Ventas\u201d). Effective January 31, 2017, the Company closed the Four Property Lease Transaction and acquired from Ventas the underlying real estate associated with four of its operating leases for a total acquisition price of $85.0 million. The Company obtained interim, interest only, bridge financing from Berkadia for $65.0 million of the acquisition price with an initial variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 4.0% and a 36-month term, with the balance of the acquisition price paid from the Company's existing cash resources. For additional information refer to Note 3, Acquisitions\u201d, within the notes to consolidated financial statements. Prior to the Four Property Lease Transaction, the Company previously leased 11 senior housing communities from Ventas.\nIn summary, the Company's cash flows were as follows (in thousands):\n (6) On April 24, 2015, the Company exercised its right to extend the lease terms with HCP through April 30, 2026, with one 10-year renewal extension remaining available at the Company's option. \nIn January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2017-01, Business Combinations - Clarifying the Definition of a Business. ASU 2017-01 provides guidance in accounting for business combinations when determining if the transaction represents acquisitions or disposals of assets or of a business. Under ASU 2017-01, when determining whether an integrated set of assets and activities constitutes a business, entities must compare the fair value of gross assets acquired to the fair value of a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in the single identifiable assets or group of similar identifiable assets, the integrated set of assets and activities is not characterized as a business. ASU 2017-01 is applied prospectively and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. Management does not expect the adoption of ASU 2017-01 to have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nTo date, inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company. However, inflation could affect the Company's future revenues and results of operations because of, among other things, the Company's dependence on senior residents, many of whom rely primarily on fixed incomes to pay for the Company's services. As a result, during inflationary periods, the Company may not be able to increase resident service fees to account fully for increased operating expenses. In structuring its fees, the Company attempts to anticipate inflation levels, but there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to anticipate fully or otherwise respond to any future inflationary pressures.\nLease Accounting\nThe Company had two of its senior housing communities located in southeast Texas impacted by Hurricane Harvey during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Both of these communities remain fully vacated and are undergoing repairs. We maintain insurance coverage on these communities which includes damage caused by flooding. The insurance claim for this incident required a deductible of $100,000 that was expensed as a component of operating expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Through December 31, 2017, we have incurred approximately $3.9 million in clean-up and physical repair costs and we expect to incur additional repair costs which we believe are probable of being recovered through insurance proceeds. In addition to the repairs of physical damage to the buildings, the Company's insurance coverage includes loss of business income ( Business Interruption\u201d). Business Interruption includes reimbursement for lost revenue as well as incremental expenses incurred as a result of the hurricane. The Company received payments from our insurance underwriters during fiscal 2017 totaling approximately $2.7 million of which approximately $2.2 million related to Business Interruption through December 31, 2017, which has been included as a reduction to operating expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss in fiscal 2017. Based upon our initial assessment of the physical damages and insurance coverage, the Company currently estimates insurance proceeds will be sufficient to reimburse the Company for all damages and repair costs to fully restore the communities to their condition prior to the incident.\nPurchase Accounting\n \u2022 The $12.9 million loss on facility lease termination is due to the Four Property Lease Transaction that closed on January 31, 2017, whereby the Company acquired the underlying real estate associated with four of the senior housing communities previously leased from Ventas. For additional information, refer to Note 3, Acquisitions\u201d, within the notes to consolidated financial statements. \nThe Company had net cash used in investing activities of $124.9 million, $201.0 million, and $161.4 million in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2017 primarily results from capital expenditures of $40.0 million associated with ongoing capital renovations and refurbishments at the Company's senior housing communities and the acquisition of senior housing communities by the Company of $85.0 million. The net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2016 primarily results from capital expenditures of $62.4 million and acquisitions of senior housing communities by the Company of $138.8 million. The net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2015 primarily results from capital expenditures of $42.4 million and acquisitions of senior housing communities by the Company of $162.5 million, partially offset by proceeds from the Sedgwick Sale Transaction and Four Property Sale Transaction of $43.5 million.\n (4) Effective June 17, 2015, the Company executed amendments to the master lease agreements with Ventas to facilitate leasehold improvements for 10 of the leased communities, of which the underlying real estate associated with four of its operating leases was acquired by the Company upon closing the Four Property Lease Transaction on January 31, 2017, and extend the lease terms through September 30, 2025, with two five-year renewal extensions available at the Company's option. \n \u2022 The increase in operating expenses primarily results from an increase of $21.2 million from the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2016, a full year of activity for the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2015, and an increase of $6.0 million at the Company's same-store communities primarily due to increased wages and benefits to employees for annual merit increases as well as the incremental costs to support changes in occupancy mix with more of our residents at higher levels of care, partially offset by a decrease of $2.0 million due to the Sedgwick Sale Transaction and Four Property Sale Transaction each of which closed in fiscal 2015. \nResident revenue was $447.4 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $412.2 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, representing an increase of $35.3 million, or 8.6%. The increase in resident revenue primarily results from an increase of $31.0 million from the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2016 and a full year of activity for the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2015 and an increase of $6.8 million due to a 2.0% increase in average monthly rental rates at the Company's same-store communities, slightly offset by a decrease of $2.6 million due to the Company's sale of one of its senior housing communities located in Wichita, Kansas, (the Sedgwick Sale Transaction\u201d) and the Company's sale of four senior housing communities located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Shreveport, Louisiana, Southfield, Michigan, and Winston-Salem, North Carolina (the Four Property Sale Transaction\u201d), each of which closed in fiscal 2015.\nOverview\nNet loss and comprehensive loss\n (3) Deferred gains of $34.5 million and lease concessions of $2.6 million are being recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss as a reduction in facility lease expense over the respective initial lease term. Lease concessions of $0.6 million relate to the transaction with HCP on May 31, 2006, and $2.0 million relate to the transaction with Welltower on September 10, 2010. \nExpenses\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, selected historical Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss data in thousands of dollars and expressed as a percentage of total revenues.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance for workers' compensation. Determining the reserve for workers' compensation losses and costs that the Company has incurred as of the end of a reporting period involves significant judgments based on projected future events, including potential settlements for pending claims, known incidents which may result in claims, estimates of incurred but not yet reported claims, changes in insurance premiums, estimated litigation costs and other factors. The Company regularly adjusts these estimates to reflect changes in the foregoing factors. However, since this reserve is based on estimates, the actual expenses incurred may differ from the amounts reserved. Any subsequent changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they are determined.\nEmployee Health and Dental Benefits, Workers' Compensation, and Insurance Reserves\n\nProvision for income taxes\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company leased 46 senior housing communities from certain real estate investment trusts ( REITs\u201d). The lease terms are generally for 10-15 years with renewal options for 5-20 years at the Company's option. Under these lease agreements, the Company is responsible for all operating costs, maintenance and repairs, insurance and property taxes. No new facility leases were entered into by the Company during fiscal 2017.\nCertain information contained in this report constitutes Forward-Looking Statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as may,\u201d will,\u201d would,\u201d intend,\u201d could,\u201d believe,\u201d expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d estimate\u201d or continue\u201d or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology. The Company cautions readers that forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those relating to the Company's future business prospects, revenues, working capital, liquidity, capital needs, interest costs, and income, are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, due to several important factors herein identified. These factors include the Company's ability to find suitable acquisition properties at favorable terms, financing, licensing, business conditions, risks of downturn in economic conditions generally, satisfaction of closing conditions such as those pertaining to licensure, availability of insurance at commercially reasonable rates, and changes in accounting principles and interpretations, among others, and other risks and factors identified from time to time in the Company's reports filed with the SEC.\nOn December 15, 2017, the Company completed supplemental mortgage financing of approximately $4.1 million from Fannie Mae at a fixed interest rate of 5.71% on one community located in Oneonta, New York. The supplemental mortgage loan is coterminous, cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with the original existing mortgage debt maturing in June 2025.\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. At each balance sheet date, the Company reviews the carrying value of its property and equipment to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that they may be impaired or that the depreciation period may need to be changed. The Company considers internal factors such as net operating losses along with external factors relating to each asset, including contract changes, local market developments, and other publicly available information. If an indicator of impairment is identified, the carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair market value, generally based on discounted cash\n (2) Reflects future minimum lease commitments under the Company's various property and equipment lease agreements at current rental rates. \nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company leased 15 senior housing communities (collectively the HCP Lease Agreements\u201d) from HCP, Inc. ( HCP\u201d). During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company executed an amendment to the master lease agreement with HCP to facilitate up to $3.3 million of leasehold improvements for one community within the HCP lease portfolio and extend the initial lease terms for nine communities until October 31, 2020, with two 10-year renewal extensions available at the Company's option. During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company exercised its right to extend the lease term with HCP for the remaining six communities in the HCP lease portfolio until April 30, 2026, with one 10-year renewal extension available at the Company's option. The initial lease rates under the HCP Lease Agreements ranged from 7.25% to 8% and are subject to certain conditional escalation clauses, which will be recognized when probable or incurred. The Company incurred $1.6 million in lease acquisition and modification costs related to the HCP Lease Agreements. These deferred lease acquisition and modification costs are being amortized over the lease terms and are included in facility lease expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company accounts for each of the HCP Lease Agreements as an operating lease.\nThe following discussion and analysis addresses (i) the Company's results of operations on a historical consolidated basis for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, and (ii) liquidity and capital resources of the Company and should be read in conjunction with the Company's historical consolidated financial statements and the selected financial data contained elsewhere in this report.\n\n\nThe following table provides the amounts due under specified contractual obligations for the periods indicated as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\n \u2022 The decrease in facility lease expense primarily results from the Four Property Lease Transaction that closed on January 31, 2017. \nAs a result of the foregoing factors, the Company reported net loss and comprehensive loss of $(28.0 million) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, compared to net loss and comprehensive loss of $(14.3 million) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting. ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in ASU 2016-09 are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-09 on January 1, 2017, and incorporated the provisions of this update into its consolidated financial statements upon adoption. Upon adoption, the Company elected to change its accounting policy to account for forfeitures as they occur. This change was applied on a modified retrospective basis with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of $0.2 million. Additionally, the adoption of ASU 2016-09 resulted in the Company recording an adjustment of $5.3 million, which resulted in an increase to the Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowance, to recognize net operating loss carryforwards attributable to excess tax benefits on stock compensation that had not been previously recognized to additional paid in capital. Excess tax benefits for share-based payments are now included in net operating activities rather than net financing activities within the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, these reporting changes have been applied prospectively and prior periods have not been adjusted.\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td>\nThe Company issued standby letters of credit with Chase, totaling approximately $2.9 million, for the benefit of HCP on certain leases between HCP and the Company.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \u2022 The increase in stock-based compensation expense results from the accelerated vesting of restricted stock awards for severance benefits associated with the passing of the Company's Chief Operating Officer in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company granting additional shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units to certain employees and directors of the Company during fiscal 2016, some of which required accelerated expense recognition, and a full year of amortization for restricted stock awards and units granted during fiscal 2015. \nITEM 7.\nOther income and expense\nChanges in the current economic environment could result in decreases in the fair value of assets, slowing of transactions, and tightening liquidity and credit markets. These impacts could make securing debt for acquisitions or refinancings for the Company, its joint ventures, or buyers of the Company's properties more difficult or on terms not acceptable to the Company. Additionally, the Company may be more susceptible to being negatively impacted by operating or performance deficits based on the exposure associated with certain lease coverage requirements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. ASU 2016-02 amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. ASU 2016-02 will be effective beginning in 2019. Early adoption of ASU 2016-02 as of its issuance is permitted. The new leases standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new leases standard on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). ASU 2016-18 requires an entity to include in its cash and cash-equivalent balances in the statement of cash flows those amounts that are deemed to be restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. ASU 2016-18 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Management does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-18 to have a material impact on the Company's cash flows.\nSignificant Financial and Operational Highlights\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOn January 31, 2017, in conjunction with the Four Property Lease Transaction, the Company obtained $65.0 million of mortgage debt from Berkadia. The new mortgage loan is interest-only and has a three-year term with an initial variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 4.00%.\nResident revenue is recognized at estimated net realizable amounts, based on historical experiences, due from residents in the period to which the rental and other services are provided. Additionally, substantially all community fees received from residents are non-refundable and are recorded initially by the Company as deferred revenue. The deferred amounts are amortized over the respective residents' initial lease term which is consistent with the contractual obligation associated with the estimated stay of the resident.\n\n \u2022 Interest expense increased $7.3 million in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to an increase of $2.0 million from a full year of activity for the additional mortgage debt associated with the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2016 and an increase of $5.2 million at the Company's same-store communities due to the Four Property Lease Transaction that closed on January 31, 2017, additional mortgage debt for supplemental loans obtained by the Company during fiscal 2017, and a full year of activity for certain refinancings and supplemental loans obtained by the Company during fiscal 2016. \nOperating Activities\nResults of Operations\nThe Company offers certain full-time employees an option to participate in its health and dental plans. The Company is self-insured up to certain limits and is insured if claims in excess of these limits are incurred. The cost of employee health and dental benefits, net of employee contributions, is shared between the corporate office and the senior housing communities based on the respective number of plan participants. Funds collected are used to pay the actual program costs including estimated annual claims, third-party administrative fees, network provider fees, communication costs, and other related administrative costs incurred by the plans. Claims are paid as they are submitted to the Company's third-party administrator. The Company records a liability for outstanding claims and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. This liability is based on the historical claim reporting lag and payment trends of health insurance claims. Management believes that the liability for outstanding losses and expenses is adequate to cover the ultimate cost of losses and expenses incurred at December 31, 2017; however, actual claims and expenses may differ. Any subsequent changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they are determined.\n \u2022 Interest expense increased $6.5 million in fiscal 2016 when compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to an increase of $5.0 million from the additional mortgage debt associated with the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2016 and a full year of interest for the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2015 and an increase of $1.7 million at the Company's consolidated same-store communities due to additional mortgage debt added by the Company associated with supplemental loans that occurred during fiscal 2016 and a full year of activity for certain refinancing's and supplemental loans that occurred during fiscal 2015, slightly offset by a decrease of $0.2 million due to the Sedgwick Sale Transaction and Four Property Sale Transaction each of which closed in fiscal 2015. \nIn addition to approximately $17.6 million of unrestricted cash balances on hand as of December 31, 2017, the Company's principal sources of liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operations, supplemental debt financings, additional proceeds from debt refinancings, equity issuances, and/or proceeds from the sale of assets. The Company expects its available cash and cash flows from operations, supplemental debt financings, additional proceeds from debt refinancings, and proceeds from the sale of assets to be sufficient to fund its short-term working capital requirements. The Company's long-term capital requirements, primarily for acquisitions and other corporate initiatives, could be dependent on its ability to access additional funds through joint ventures and the debt and/or equity markets. The Company from time to time considers and evaluates transactions related to its portfolio including supplemental debt financings, debt refinancings, equity issuances, purchases and sales of assets, reorganizations and other transactions. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that the Company will be able to obtain the capital necessary to meet the Company's short and long-term capital requirements.\nThe fair value of acquired lease-related intangibles reflects the estimated fair value of existing resident in-place leases as represented by the cost to obtain residents and an estimated absorption period to reflect the value of the rent and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease-up period as if the property acquired was vacant. The Company amortizes any acquired resident in-place lease intangibles to depreciation and amortization expense over the estimated remaining useful life of the respective resident operating leases.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company leased 24 senior housing communities (collectively the Welltower Lease Agreements\u201d) from Welltower, Inc., formerly Health Care REIT, Inc. ( Welltower\u201d). The Welltower Lease Agreements each have an initial term of 15 years, with one 15-year renewal extension available at the Company's option. The initial lease rates under the Welltower Lease Agreements ranged from 7.25% to 8.5% and are subject to certain conditional escalation clauses, which will be recognized when probable or incurred. The initial terms on the Welltower Lease Agreements expire on various dates through April 2026. The Company incurred $2.1 million in lease acquisition costs related to the Welltower Lease Agreements. These deferred lease acquisition costs are being amortized over the lease terms and are included in facility lease expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company accounts for each of the Welltower Lease Agreements as an operating lease.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15 amends the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 230, which often requires judgment to determine the appropriate classification of cash flows as operating, investing or financing activities and has resulted in diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are classified. ASU 2016-15 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and should be applied on a retrospective basis. Management does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-15 to have a material impact on the Company's cash flows.\n \u2022 Other income in fiscal 2016 primarily represents payments received by the Company associated with certain legal settlements. \nThe Company primarily derives its revenue by providing senior living housing and services to the elderly. When comparing fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2016, the Company generated total revenues of approximately $467.0 million compared to total revenues of approximately $447.4 million, respectively, representing an increase of approximately $19.5 million, or 4.4%. The increase in revenues primarily results from a full year of activity for the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2016 which resulted in an increase in revenue of approximately $15.3 million and we experienced an increase in revenue at our same-store communities of approximately $4.3 million. The increase in revenue at our same-store communities during fiscal 2017 was negatively impacted by Hurricane Harvey which resulted in the full evacuation of our residents at two of our senior housing communities located in southeast Texas. Both of these communities are undergoing repairs and remain fully vacated which resulted in a decrease of approximately $3.5 million in our same-store revenue during fiscal 2017.\nProvision for income taxes for fiscal 2017 was $2.5 million, or 6.0% of loss before income taxes, compared to a provision for income taxes of $0.4 million, or 1.6% of loss before income taxes, for fiscal 2016. The effective tax rates for fiscal 2017 and 2016 differ from the statutory tax rates due to state income taxes, permanent tax differences, and changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. The Company is impacted by the Texas Margin Tax ( TMT\u201d), which effectively imposes tax on modified gross revenues for communities within the State of Texas. During each of fiscal 2017 and 2016, the Company consolidated 38 Texas communities and the TMT increased the overall provision for income taxes. The increase in provision for income taxes for fiscal 2017 was attributable to an increase of $0.2 million for higher state income taxes with the remaining $1.9 million due to recent tax legislation changes associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( TCJA\u201d), which was enacted on December 22, 2017.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related notes. Management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience, observance of industry trends and various other sources of information and factors, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The Company believes the following are our most critical accounting policies and/or typically require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.\nManagement regularly evaluates the future realization of deferred tax assets and provides a valuation allowance, if considered necessary, based on such evaluation. As part of the evaluation, management has evaluated taxable income in carryback years, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, feasible tax planning strategies, and future expectations of income. Based upon this evaluation, adjustments to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $5.9 million and $8.6 million were recorded during fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, to reduce the Company's net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nFacility Leases\n (2) Lease acquisition and modification costs are being amortized over the respective lease terms. \n \u2022 The increase in operating expenses primarily results from an increase of $11.6 million from a full year of activity for the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2016 and an increase of $5.2 million at the Company's same-store communities primarily due to increased wages and benefits to employees for annual merit increases and incremental costs, including increased labor costs for additional staffing required for newly licensed memory care and assisted living units, to support changes in occupancy with more of our residents at higher levels of care. The increase in operating expenses at our same-store communities included a reduction of $2.2 million for insurance proceeds the Company received to cover Business Interruption through December 31, 2017, for the period the two communities located in southeast Texas were unoccupied due to Hurricane Harvey. \nDebt Transactions\nProvision for income taxes\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, the Company reported net loss and comprehensive loss of $(44.2 million) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, compared to net loss and comprehensive loss of $(28.0 million) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.\n \u2022 The increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily results from an increase of $3.4 million from a full year of activity for the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2016 and an increase of $8.7 million due to an increase in depreciable assets at the Company's same-store communities, partially offset by a decrease in in-place lease amortization of $6.3 million from senior housing communities acquired by the Company prior to fiscal 2016. \nTotal expenses were $459.2 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $433.1 million during fiscal 2016, representing an increase of $26.1 million, or 6.0%. This increase is primarily the result of a $16.8 million increase in operating expenses, a $12.9 million loss on facility lease termination, and a $5.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, slightly offset by a $5.3 million decrease in facility lease expense and a $4.0 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense.\n \u2022 Gain on disposition of assets in fiscal 2015 is primarily attributable to the Sedgwick Sale Transaction, slightly offset with final closing cost adjustments associated with the Four Property Sale Transaction. \nIn determining the allocation of the purchase price of senior housing communities acquired to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, the Company makes estimates of fair value using information obtained as a result of pre-acquisition due diligence, leasing activities and/or independent appraisals. The Company assigns the purchase price for senior living communities to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values which are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations. The determination of fair value involves the use of significant judgments and estimates which is generally assessed as follows:\nThe Company issued standby letters of credit with JPMorgan Chase Bank ( Chase\u201d), totaling approximately $6.7 million, for the benefit of Welltower, on certain leases between Welltower and the Company.\nThe Company had no material off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2017.\nInvesting Activities\nFinancing Activities\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\n \u2022 The decrease in stock-based compensation expense results from the accelerated vesting of restricted stock awards for severance benefits associated with the passing of the Company's Chief Operating Officer in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company granting fewer shares of restricted stock to certain employees of the Company during fiscal 2017. \nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company executed amendments to the master lease agreements with Ventas to facilitate up to $24.5 million of leasehold improvements for 10 communities within the Ventas lease portfolio and extend the lease terms until September 30, 2025, with two five-year renewal extensions available at the Company's option. During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company executed amendments to the master lease agreements with Ventas to increase the Special Project Funds for leasehold improvements from $24.5 million to $28.5 million and extend the date for completion of the leasehold improvements to June 30, 2017. During fiscal 2017, the Company executed amendments to the master lease agreements with Ventas to decrease the Special Project Funds for leasehold improvements from $28.5 million to approximately $17.0 million due to the Four Property Lease Transaction and extend the date for completion of the leasehold improvements to June 30, 2018. The initial lease rates under each of the Ventas Lease Agreements ranged from 6.75% to 8% and are subject to certain conditional escalation clauses which will be recognized when probable or incurred. The Company initially incurred $11.4 million in lease acquisition and modification costs related to the Ventas Lease Agreements, of which a portion of these costs were written-off upon closing the Four Property Lease Transaction leaving $8.7 million in lease acquisition and modification costs associated with the remaining properties. These deferred lease acquisition and modification costs are being amortized over the lease terms and are included in facility lease expense in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company accounts for five of the Ventas Lease Agreements as an operating lease and two as a capital lease and financing obligation.\nOn November 30, 2017, the Company completed supplemental mortgage financing of approximately $3.0 million from Fannie Mae at a fixed interest rate of 5.49% on one community located in Rocky River, Ohio. The supplemental mortgage loan is coterminous, cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with the original existing mortgage debt maturing in January 2023.\nEffective January 31, 2017, the Company acquired the underlying real estate associated with four of the senior housing communities previously leased from Ventas, Inc. ( Ventas\u201d) for an acquisition price of $85.0 million (the Four Property Lease Transaction\u201d). The Company obtained interest only, bridge financing from Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC ( Berkadia\u201d) for $65.0 million of the acquisition price with an initial variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 4.0% and a 36-month term, with the balance of the acquisition price paid from the Company's existing cash resources. For additional information refer to Note 3, Acquisitions\u201d, within the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nTotal expenses were $433.1 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $393.3 million during fiscal 2015, representing an increase of $39.7 million, or 10.1%. This increase in expenses is primarily the result of a $25.2 million increase in operating expenses, a $7.4 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, a $3.3 million increase in general and administrative expenses, a $2.8 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, a $0.5 million increase in provision for bad debts, and a $0.5 million increase in facility lease expense.\nRevenues\nNet loss and comprehensive loss\n \u2022 Interest income generally reflects interest earned on the investment of cash balances and escrowed funds or interest associated with certain income tax refunds or property tax settlements. \nThe following table presents certain unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the four quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. This information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company appearing elsewhere in this report and include, in the opinion of the Company's management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the quarterly results when read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and the related notes thereto.\nLaws and regulations governing the Medicaid program are complex and subject to interpretation. The Company believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and is not aware of any pending or threatened investigations involving allegations of potential wrongdoing. While no such regulatory inquiries have been made, compliance with such laws and regulations can be subject to future government review and interpretation as well as significant regulatory action including fines, penalties, and exclusion from the Medicaid program.\n \u2022 The increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily results from an increase of $11.1 million from senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2016 and a full year of activity for the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2015 and an increase of $4.0 million due to an increase in depreciable assets at the Company's same-store communities, partially offset by a decrease in in-place lease amortization of $7.4 million from senior housing communities acquired by the Company prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and a decrease of $0.3 million due to the Sedgwick Sale Transaction and Four Property Sale Transaction each of which closed in fiscal 2015. \nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nExpenses\n</td> </tr>\nflows, of the long-lived asset. The Company does not believe there are any indicators of impairment that would require an adjustment to the carrying value of the property and equipment or their remaining useful lives as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe Company had net cash provided by financing activities of $53.0 million, $126.7 million, and $129.4 million in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2017 primarily results from notes payable proceeds of $77.2 million, of which $65.0 million is related to new mortgage debt associated with the acquisition of senior housing communities by the Company, approximately $7.1 million related to supplemental mortgage debt obtained on the Company's existing owned senior housing communities, and approximately $5.1 million related to insurance premium financing, partially offset by repayments of notes payable of $20.1 million, payments on capital lease and financing obligations of $2.9 million, and deferred financing charges paid of $1.2 million associated with the acquisition of senior housing communities by the Company. The net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2016 primarily results from notes payable proceeds of $150.8 million, of which approximately $101.5 million is related to new mortgage debt associated with the acquisition of senior housing communities by the Company, approximately $44.4 million related to supplemental mortgage debt obtained on existing senior housing communities, and approximately $4.9 million related to insurance premium financing, partially offset by repayments of notes payable of $17.7 million, purchases of treasury stock of $2.5 million, deferred financing charges paid of $2.5 million, and payments on capital lease and financing obligations of $1.3 million. The net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2015 primarily results from notes payable proceeds of $250.9 million, of which approximately $118.1 million is related to new mortgage debt associated with the acquisition of senior housing communities by the Company, approximately $2.2 million related to insurance premium financing, and the remaining $130.6 million resulted from supplemental financings, mortgage refinancings, or new mortgage debt obtained on existing unencumbered senior housing communities, partially offset by repayments of notes payable of $115.9 million, deferred financing charges paid of $3.8 million, payments on capital lease and financing obligations of $1.0 million, and additions to restricted cash of $0.9 million.\n\n \u2022 Write-off of deferred loan costs and prepayment premiums in fiscal 2015 is primarily attributable to the early repayment of certain mortgage debt on the Company's owned senior housing communities due to scheduled maturities and the opportunity to replace interim variable interest rate debt with long-term fixed interest rate financing. \nOn May 31, 2017, the Company renewed certain insurance policies and entered into a finance agreement totaling approximately $1.6 million. The finance agreement has a fixed interest rate of 2.76% with the principal being repaid over an 11-month term.\nThe Company is one of the largest operators of senior housing communities in the United States. The Company's operating strategy is to provide value to its senior living residents by providing quality senior living services at reasonable prices, while achieving and sustaining a strong, competitive position within its geographically concentrated regions, as well as continuing to enhance the performance of its operations. The Company provides senior living services to the elderly, including independent living, assisted living, and memory care services at reasonable prices. Many of the Company's communities offer a continuum of care to meet its residents' needs as they change over time. This continuum of care, which integrates independent living, assisted living, and memory care, and is bridged by home care through independent home care agencies, sustains residents' autonomy and independence based on their physical and mental abilities.\n \u2022 Interest income generally reflects interest earned on the investment of cash balances and escrowed funds or interest associated with certain income tax refunds or property tax settlements. \nThe Company determines whether to account for its leases as operating, capital or financing leases depending on the underlying terms of each lease agreement. This determination of classification requires significant judgment relating to certain information, including the estimated fair value and remaining economic life of the community, the Company's cost of funds, minimum lease payments and other lease terms. The lease rates under the Company's lease agreements are subject to certain conditional escalation clauses which are recognized when probable or incurred and are based on changes in the consumer price index or certain operational performance measures. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company leased 46 and 50 communities, respectively, two of which the Company classified as capital lease and financing obligations with the remaining classified as operating leases. The Company incurs lease acquisition costs and amortizes these costs over the term of the respective lease agreement. Certain leases entered into by the Company qualified as sale/leaseback transactions, and as such, any related gains have been deferred and are being amortized over the respective lease term. No new communities were leased by the Company during fiscal 2017 or 2016. Effective January 31, 2017, the Company acquired from Ventas the underlying real estate associated with four of its operating leases. For additional information refer to Note 3, Acquisitions\u201d, within the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nResident revenue was $467.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $447.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $19.5 million, or 4.4%. The increase in resident revenue primarily results from an increase of $15.3 million from a full year of activity for the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2016 and an increase of $4.3 million due to a 2.8% increase in average monthly rental rates at the Company's same-store communities which was primarily the result of annual rent increases for our existing residents and recent capital improvements we have invested in our communities for unit conversions which enable us to provide a broader range of senior living services at higher levels of care. The increase in resident revenue at our same-store communities was negatively impacted by Hurricane Harvey which resulted in the full evacuation of our residents at two of our communities located in southeast Texas. Both of these communities are undergoing repairs and remain fully vacated which resulted in a decrease in our same-store resident revenue of approximately $3.5 million.\n \u2022 The increase in general and administrative expenses primarily results from an increase of $1.8 million in employee insurance benefits and claims paid, which resulted in higher health insurance costs to the Company, an increase of $1.1 million for severance benefits associated with the passing of the Company's Chief Operating Officer in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, and an increase of $0.4 million in wages and benefits for existing employee annual merit increases and additional employees hired during fiscal 2016. \nCredit Risk and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe following table summarizes each of the Company's facility lease agreements as of December 31, 2017 (dollars in millions):\nOn November 30, 2017, the Company completed supplemental mortgage financing of approximately $3.0 million from Fannie Mae at a fixed interest rate of 5.49% on one community located in Rocky River, Ohio. The supplemental mortgage loan is coterminous, cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with the original existing mortgage debt maturing in January 2023.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets. Under ASU 2014-09, an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company has evaluated the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures. Based on our assessment, we do not believe it will have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company is planning to adopt the standard under the modified retrospective adoption.\nLong-term debt relates to the aggregate maturities of the Company's notes payable. As of December 31, 2017, the Company leases its corporate headquarters in Dallas, an executive office in New York, 46 senior housing communities and certain equipment used at the Company's communities.\nThe Company allocates the fair values of buildings acquired on an as-if-vacant basis and depreciates the building values over the estimated remaining lives of the buildings, not to exceed 40 years. The Company determines the allocated values of other fixed assets, such as site improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment, based upon the replacement cost and depreciates such values over the assets' estimated remaining useful lives as determined at the acquisition date. The Company determines the value of land by considering the sales prices of similar properties in recent transactions.\n (5) On November 11, 2013, the Company executed an amendment to the master lease agreement associated with nine of its leased communities with HCP to facilitate leasehold improvements for one of the leased communities and extend the respective lease terms through October 31, 2020, with two 10-year renewal extensions available at the Company's option. \nOther income and expense\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\n \u2022 Other income in fiscal 2016 represents payments received by the Company associated with certain legal settlements. \nThe Company had net cash provided by operating activities of $55.6 million, $52.3 million, and $48.9 million in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2017 primarily results from net non-cash charges of $96.0 million, a decrease in other assets of $4.1 million, an increase in other liabilities of $5.0 million, and an increase in accounts payable of $2.8 million, and in increase in accrued expenses of $1.7 million, partially offset by net loss of $(44.2 million), an increase in accounts receivable of $8.2 million, and a decrease in deferred resident revenue of $1.9 million. The net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2016 primarily results from net non-cash charges of $82.1 million, an increase in accrued expenses of $4.8 million and an increase in accounts payable of $1.7 million, partially offset by net loss of $(28.0 million), an increase in accounts receivable of $2.5 million, an increase in other assets of $2.2 million, an increase in prepaid expenses of $2.0 million, and a decrease in deferred resident revenue of $1.1 million. The net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2015 primarily results from net non-cash charges of $63.8 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses of $2.4 million, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $3.0 million, and an increase in deferred resident rent and customer deposits of $0.5 million, partially offset by net loss of $(14.3 million), an increase in accounts receivable of $2.9 million, an increase in property tax and insurance deposits of $2.2 million, and an increase in other assets of $1.3 million.\n (1) Initial lease rates are measured against agreed upon fair market values and are subject to conditional lease escalation provisions as set forth in each respective lease agreement. \n \u2022 The increase in facility lease expense primarily results from contingent annual rental rate escalations for certain existing facility leases. \nDisclosures About Contractual Obligations\nThe Company evaluates uncertain tax positions through consideration of accounting and reporting guidance on criteria, measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition that is intended to provide better financial-statement comparability among different companies. The Company is required to recognize a tax benefit in its financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management's assessment is that its position is more likely than not\u201d (i.e., a greater than 50 percent likelihood) to be upheld on audit based only on the technical merits of the tax position. The Company's policy is to recognize interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and penalties as income tax expense. The Company is generally no longer subject to federal and state income tax audits for years prior to 2014.", "item_7_tables": "Table 61: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less
