Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview and Background\nWe are an internally managed real estate company that owns and seeks to acquire high-quality farmland located in agricultural markets throughout North America. As of the date of this Annual Report, we own farms with an aggregate of approximately 142,223 acres in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. As of the date of this Annual Report, approximately 75% of the acres in our portfolio are used to grow primary crops, such as corn, soybeans, wheat, rice and cotton, and approximately 25% of the acres in our portfolio produce specialty crops, such as blueberries, vegetables, citrus, nuts and edible beans. We believe our portfolio gives investors exposure to the increasing global food demand trend in the face of growing scarcity of high quality farmland and will reflect the approximate breakdown of U.S. agricultural output between primary crops and animal protein (whose production relies principally on primary crops as feed), on one hand, and specialty crops, on the other.\nIn addition, in August 2015, we announced the launch of the FPI Loan Program, an agricultural lending product aimed at farmers, as a complement to our primary business of acquiring and owning farmland and leasing it to farmers. Under the FPI Loan Program, we make loans to third-party farmers (both tenant and non-tenant) to provide partial financing for working capital requirements and operational farming activities, farming infrastructure projects, and for other farming and agricultural real estate related purposes.\nWe were incorporated in Maryland on September 27, 2013, and we are the sole member of the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, which is a Delaware limited partnership that was formed on September 27, 2013. All of our assets are held by, and our operations are primarily conducted through, the Operating Partnership and its wholly owned subsidiaries. As of the date of this Annual Report we own 83.8% of the OP units and none of the Preferred units. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Preferred units.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we owned 75.1% of the OP units in the Operating Partnership.\nWe elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our short taxable year ended December 31, 2014.\nRecent Developments\nMerger with American Farmland Company\nWe acquired the properties listed in the table below in connection with the AFCO Mergers which closed on February 2, 2017, and, as a result, our portfolio now consists of approximately 75% row crop farmland and 25% specialty crop farmland by value.\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nState\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal Approximate Acres\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nArkansas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,445 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCalifornia\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCalifornia\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCalifornia\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCalifornia\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCalifornia\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,247 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCalifornia\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCalifornia\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCalifornia\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCalifornia\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCalifornia\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCalifornia\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCalifornia\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCalifornia\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFlorida\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,694 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFlorida\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFlorida\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,637 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeorgia / Alabama\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,840 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIllinois\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,652 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIllinois\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIllinois\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,195 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17,817 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn connection with the AFCO Mergers we issued 14,763,604 shares of our common stock as consideration in the Company Merger, 17,373 shares of our common stock in respect of fully earned and vested AFCO restricted stock units, and 218,525 OP units in connection with the Partnership Merger at a share price of $11.41 per share on the date of the merger for a total consideration of $171.1 million.

The offering is made pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was declared effective by the SEC on May 14, 2015. As of December 31, 2016, 994,908 shares had been issued under the program for aggregate net proceeds of $11.1 million at a weighted average price per share of $11.17.\nFinancing Activity\nOn December 21, 2016, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership entered into a loan agreement with The Prudential Insurance Company of America ( Prudential\u201d) which provides for a loan of approximately $6.6 million to\nthe Company with a maturity date of July 1, 2019 (the Prudential Note\u201d). Interest on the Prudential Note is payable in cash semi-annually and accrues at a fixed rate of 3.20% per annum. Proceeds from the Prudential Note were used to acquire additional properties and for general corporate purposes.\nOn January 12, 2017, five wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, entered into a loan agreement (the Fifth MetLife Loan Agreement\u201d) with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ( Metlife\u201d) which provides for a loan of approximately $8.4 million to the Company with a maturity date of January 12, 2027 ( Term Loan 5\u201d). Interest on Term Loan 5 is payable in cash semi-annually and accrues at a 3.26% per annum fixed rate, this may be adjusted by MetLife on each of Janaury 12, 2020, January 12, 2023 and January 12, 2026 at the option of the Lender to a rate that is consistent with similar loans. Proceeds from Term Loan 5 were used to acquire additional properties and for general corporate purposes.\nIn connection with the Term Loan 5, on January 12, 2017, the Company and the Operating Partnership each entered into a separate guaranty (the Term Loan 5 Guaranties\u201d) whereby the Company and the Operating Partnership jointly and severally agreed to unconditionally guarantee all of the borrowers' obligations under the Fifth MetLife Loan Agreement.\nAs part of the AFCO Mergers, by virtue of AFCO OP becoming a subsidiary of the Company and the Operating Partnership, the Company and the Operating Partnership acquired four senior secured credit facilities in the aggregate amount of $90 million (the Existing Rutledge Loans\u201d) by and between AFCO OP and Rutledge Investment Company ( Rutledge\u201d). On February 3, 2017, AFCO OP entered into the Second Amendment to the Existing Rutledge Credit Facilities and the Company and the Operating Partnership each entered into guaranty agreements pursuant to which they will unconditionally guarantee the obligations of AFCO OP the Existing Rutledge Loan Agreements. In addition, on February 3, 2017, AFCO OP entered into a fifth loan agreement with Rutledge (the Fifth Rutledge Loan Agreement\u201d and, together with the Existing Rutledge Loan Agreements, the Rutledge Loan Agreements\u201d) with respect to a senior secured credit facility in the aggregate amount of $30 million. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Consolidated Indebtedness-Rutledge Credit Facilities.\u201d\nOn February 14, 2017, five wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, entered into a loan agreement (the Sixth MetLife Loan Agreement\u201d) with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ( Metlife\u201d) which provides for a loan of approximately $27.2 million to the Company with a maturity date of February 14, 2027 ( Term Loan 6\u201d). Interest on Term Loan 6 is payable in cash semi-annually and accrues at a 3.21% per annum fixed rate, this may be adjusted by MetLife on each of February 14, 2020, February 14, 2023 and February 14, 2026 at the option of the Lender to a rate that is consistent with similar loans. Proceeds from Term Loan 6 were used to acquire additional properties.\nIn connection with the Term Loan 6, on February 14, 2017, the Company and the Operating Partnership each entered into a separate guaranty (the Term Loan 6 Guaranties\u201d) whereby the Company and the Operating Partnership jointly and severally agreed to unconditionally guarantee all of the borrowers' obligations under the Sixth MetLife Loan Agreement.\nTermination of Leases\nThe Company entered into two separate sale and partial leaseback transactions in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia in December 2014 and June 2015. These leases were due to expire on December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2019. The tenant and the Company agreed to terminate the leases effective as of December 31, 2016. As part of the termination settlement, the tenant agreed to pay an additional rent amount related to 2016 of $2.8 million. In addition, the Company fully recognized as 2016 revenue certain rent payments, totaling $3.7 million, of which the majority was made by the tenant in June 2015, that the Company had not yet recognized under its revenue recognition policy.\nSub-Advisory Agreement\nUpon consummation of the AFCO Mergers, by virtue of AFCO being merged with and into one of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries and AFCO OP becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, the Company acquired the Amended and Restated Sub-Advisory Agreement, dated as of October 23, 2015 (the Sub-Advisory Agreement\u201d), by and among AFCO, American Farmland Advisors, AFCO OP and Prudential Capital Mortgage Company (the Sub-\nAdvisor\u201d). On February 18, 2017, Farmland Partners Inc. (the Company\u201d) entered into a Termination Agreement (the Termination Agreement\u201d) with the Sub-Advisor pursuant to which the Company and Prudential agreed to terminate the Sub-Advisory Agreement and certain related property management agreements (together with the Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Prudential Agreements\u201d).\nThe Termination Agreement provides that, as of March 31, 2017, Prudential will no longer provide services to the Company under the Prudential Agreements. The Company has agreed to pay Prudential $1.6 million in cash, which is equal to the fee that would be owed to Prudential for services through the quarter ended March 31, 2017 and a termination fee of approximately $160,000.\nFactors That May Influence Future Results of Operations and Farmland Values\nThe principal factors affecting our operating results and the value of our farmland include global demand for food relative to the global supply of food, farmland fundamentals and economic conditions in the markets in which we own farmland, and our ability to increase or maintain rental revenues while controlling expenses. Although farmland prices may show a decline from time to time, we believe that any reduction in U.S. farmland values overall is likely to be short-lived as global demand for food and agricultural commodities typically exceeds global supply. In addition, although prices for many crops experienced significant declines in 2014 and 2015, we do not believe that such declines represent a trend that will continue over the long term. Rather, we believe that long-term growth trends in global population and GDP per capita will result in increased prices for primary crops over time.\nDemand\nWe expect that global demand for food, driven primarily by significant increases in the global population and GDP per capita, will continue to be the key driver of farmland values. We further expect that global demand for most crops will continue to grow to keep pace with global population growth, which we anticipate will lead to either higher prices and/or higher yields and, therefore, higher rental rates on our farmland, as well as sustained growth in farmland values over the long-term. We also believe that growth in global GDP per capita, particularly in developing nations, will contribute significantly to increasing demand for primary crops. As global GDP per capita increases, the composition of daily caloric intake is expected to shift away from the direct consumption of primary crops toward animal-based proteins, which is expected to result in increased demand for primary crops as feed for livestock. According to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization ( UN FAO\u201d), these factors are expected to require more than one billion additional tons of global annual grain production by 2050, a 45.5% increase from 2005-2007 levels and more than two times the 475 million tons of grain produced in the United States in 2014. Furthermore, we believe that, as GDP per capita grows, a significant portion of additional household income is allocated to food and that once individuals increase consumption of, and spending on, higher quality food, they will strongly resist returning to their former dietary habits, resulting in greater inelasticity in the demand for food. As a result, we believe that, as global demand for food increases, rental rates on our farmland and the value of our farmland will increase over the long-term. Global demand for corn and soybeans as inputs in the production of biofuels such as ethanol and soy diesel also could impact the prices of corn and soybeans, which, in the long-term, could impact our rental revenues and our results of operations. However, the success of our business strategy is not dependent on growth in demand for biofuels and we do not believe that demand for corn and soybeans as inputs in the production of biofuels will materially impact our results of operations or the value of our farmland, primarily because we believe that growth in global population and GDP per capita will be more significant drivers of global demand for primary crops over the long-term.\nSupply\nGlobal supply of agricultural commodities is driven by two primary factors, the number of tillable acres available for crop production and the productivity of the acres being farmed. Although the amount of global cropland in use has gradually increased over time, growth has plateaued over the last 20 years. Cropland area continues to increase in developing countries, but after accounting for expected continuing cropland loss, the UN FAO projects only 171 million acres will be added from 2005-2007 to 2050, a 4.3% increase. In comparison, world population is expected to grow over the same period to 9.7 billion, a nearly 40% increase. While we expect growth in the global supply of arable land, we also expect that landowners will only put that land into production if increases in commodity prices and the value of farmland\ncause landowners to benefit economically from using the land for farming rather than alternative uses. We also believe that decreases in the amount of arable land in the United States and globally as a result of increasing urbanization will partially offset the impact of additional supply of farmland. The global supply of food is also impacted by the productivity per acre of tillable land. Historically, productivity gains (measured by average crop yields) have been driven by advances in seed technology, farm equipment, irrigation techniques and chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Furthermore, we expect the increasing shortage of water in many irrigated growing regions in the United States and other growing regions around the globe, often as a result of new water restrictions imposed by laws or regulations, to lead to decreased productivity growth on many acres and, in some cases, cause yields to decline on those acres.\nConditions in Our Existing Markets\nOur portfolio spans numerous farmland markets and crop types, which provides us broad diversification across conditions in these markets. Across all regions, farmland acquisitions continue to be dominated by buyers who are existing farm owners and operators; institutional and investor acquirors remain a small fraction of the industry. We generally see firm demand for high quality properties across all regions and crop types.\nWith regard to leasing dynamics, we believe quality farmland in the United States has a near-zero vacancy rate as a result of the supply and demand fundamentals discussed above. Our view is that rental rates for farmland are a function of farmland operators' view of the long-term profitability of farmland, and that many farm operators will compete for farmland even during periods of decreased profitability due to the scarcity of farmland available to rent. In particular, we believe that due to the relatively high fixed costs associated with farming operations (including equipment, labor and knowledge), many farm operators in some circumstances will rent additional acres of farmland when it becomes available in order to allocate their fixed costs over additional acres. Furthermore, because it is generally customary in the industry to provide the existing tenant with the opportunity to re-lease the land at the end of each lease term, we believe that many farm operators will rent additional land that becomes available in order to control the ability to farm that land in future periods. As a result, in our experience, many farm operators will aggressively pursue rental opportunities in their operable geographic area, even when the farmer anticipates lower current returns or short-term losses.\nIn our primary row crop farmland, we see flat to modestly lower rent rates in connection with 2017 lease renewals. This is consistent with, on the one hand, headwinds in primary crop markets and, on the other, tenant demand for leasing high quality farmland. In 2016, we had a higher portion than in 2015 of our fixed cash leases providing for payment of 50% of a year's rent after harvest rather than substantially all of the lease paid prior to harvest, as compared to 2016. This structure better matches operator cash flows. Given per acre revenue on our primary crop farmland and crop insurance levels, we do not expect that this structure materially changes tenant credit risk. Due to the short term nature of most of our primary crop leases, we believe that a recovery of crop prices and farm profitability will be reflected relatively rapidly in our revenues via increases in rent rates. Across specialty crops, operator profitability generally remains healthy. Participating lease structures are common in many specialty crops and base lease rates are consistent with 2016.\nLease Expirations\nFarm leases are often short-term in nature. As of December 31, 2016 our portfolio had the following lease expirations as a percentage of approximate acres leased and annualized minimum cash rents:\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nApproximate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nApproximate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAnnual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAnnual\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nYear Ending December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAcres\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAcres\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCash Rents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCash Rents\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,608 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n24.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,091 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n25.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n31,372 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n51.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,967 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n41.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,722 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,515 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n21.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,244 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n2022 and beyond\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,691 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n60,637 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n11,921 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have or are currently negotiating leases on 50,721 acres and have 3,978 acres which have lease payments based solely on a percentage of farming revenues or crops, which are not included in the table above. We expect that rents for primary crop farmland will experience a modest decline in 2017, partially counterbalanced throughout our portfolio by rent increases deriving from farm improvements, such as irrigation, drainage and grain storage, that were or will be put in service for the 2017 crop year. We expect that rents for specialty crop farmland will be flat to modestly increasing.\nRental Revenues\nOur revenues are primarily generated from renting farmland to operators of farming businesses. Our leases have terms ranging from one to ten years. Although the majority of our leases do not provide the tenant with a contractual right to renew the lease upon its expiration, we believe it is customary to provide the existing tenant with the opportunity to renew the lease, subject to any increase in the rental rate that we may establish. If the tenant elects not to renew the lease at the end of the lease term, the land will be offered to a new tenant.\nThe leases for the majority of the properties in our portfolio provide that tenants must pay us at least 50% (and often 100%) of the annual rent in advance of each spring planting season. As a result, we collect a significant portion of total annual rents in the first calendar quarter of each year. We believe our use of leases pursuant to which at least 50% of the annual rent is payable in advance of each spring planting season mitigates the tenant credit risk associated with the variability of farming operations that could be adversely impacted by poor crop yields, weather conditions, mismanagement, undercapitalization or other factors affecting our tenants. Prior to acquiring farmland property, we take into consideration the competitiveness of the local farm-operator tenant environment in order to enhance our ability to quickly replace a tenant that is unwilling to renew a lease or is unable to pay a rent payment when it is due. Some of our leases provide for a reimbursement of the property taxes we pay. We expect that, going forward, a progressively smaller percentage of our leases will provide for such a reimbursement.\nExpenses\nSubstantially all of our farm leases are structured in such a way that we are responsible for major maintenance, certain insurance and taxes (which are sometimes reimbursed to us by our tenants), while our tenant is responsible for minor maintenance, water usage and all of the additional input costs related to farming operations on the property, such as seed, fertilizer, labor and fuel. We expect that substantially all of the leases for farmland we acquire in the future will continue to be structured in a manner consistent with substantially all of our existing leases. As the owner of the land, we generally only bear costs related to major capital improvements permanently attached to the property, such as irrigation systems, drainage tile, grain storage facilities, permanent plantings or other physical structures customary for farms. In cases where capital expenditures are necessary, we typically seek to offset, over a period of multiple years, the costs of such capital expenditures by increasing rental rates. We also incur the costs associated with maintaining liability and casualty insurance.\nWe incur costs associated with running a public company, including, among others, costs associated with employing our personnel and compliance costs. We incur costs associated with due diligence and acquisitions, including, among others, travel expenses, consulting fees, and legal and accounting fees. We also incur costs associated with managing our farmland. The management of our farmland, generally, is not labor or capital intensive because farmland generally has minimal physical structures that require routine inspection and maintenance, and our leases, generally, are structured to require the tenant to pay many of the costs associated with the property. Furthermore, we believe that our platform is scalable, and we do not expect the expenses associated with managing our portfolio of farmland to increase significantly as the number of farm properties we own increases over time. Rather, we expect that as we continue to add additional farmland to our portfolio, we will be able to achieve economies of scale, which will enable us to reduce our operating costs per acre.\nCrop Prices\nOur exposure to short-term crop price declines is limited as most of our leases do not factor in per bushel prices and instead are set on a rental rate per acre basis. This approach is common throughout agriculture for several reasons. This approach recognizes that the value of leased land to a tenant is more closely linked to the total revenue produced on the property which is driven by crop yield and crop price. This approach simplifies the administrative requirements for the\nlandlord and the tenant significantly. This approach supports the tenants' desire to maintain access to their leased farms which are in short supply, a concept expanded upon below, by providing the landlord consistent rents. Crop price exposure is also limited because tenants also benefit from the fundamental revenue hedging that occurs when large crops mitigate the lower crop prices triggered by their large crop. Similarly, smaller crops have a tendency to increase the crop prices triggered and help increase revenue even when confronted by a smaller crop. Further risk mitigation is available to tenants, and indirectly to us, via crop insurance and hedging programs implemented by tenants. Our TRS takes advantage of this risk mitigation programs and strategies also.\nWe believe quality farmland in the United States has a near-zero vacancy rate as a result of the supply and demand fundamentals. Our view is that rental rates for farmland are a function of farmland operators' view of the long-term profitability of farmland, and that many farm operators will compete for farmland even during periods of decreased profitability due to the scarcity of farmland available to rent. In particular, we believe that due to the relatively high fixed costs associated with farming operations (including equipment, labor and knowledge), many farm operators in some circumstances will rent additional acres of farmland when it becomes available in order to allocate their fixed costs over additional acres. Furthermore, because it is generally customary in the industry to provide the existing tenant with the opportunity to re-lease the land at the end of each lease term, we believe that many farm operators will rent additional land that becomes available in order to control the ability to farm that land in future periods. As a result, in our experience, many farm operators will aggressively pursue rental opportunities in their operable geography, even when the farmer anticipates lower current returns or short-term losses.\nThe value of a crop is affected by many factors that can differ on a yearly basis. Weather conditions and crop disease in major crop production regions worldwide creates a significant risk of price volatility, which may either increase or decrease the value of the crops that our tenants produce each year. Other material factors adding to the volatility of crop prices are changes in government regulations and policy, fluctuations in global prosperity, fluctuations in foreign trade and export markets, and eruptions of military conflicts or civil unrest. Prices for many primary crops, particularly corn, experienced meaningful declines in 2014 and 2015. We do not believe such declines represent a trend over the long term. Rather, we believe those declines represented a combination of correction to historical norms (adjusted for inflation) and high yields induced by farmer planting decisions and unusually favorable weather patterns. We expect that continued long-term growth trends in global population and GDP per capita will result in increased prices for primary crops over time. We expect pricing across specialty crops to generally remains firm relative to 2016 as U.S. and global consumer demand remains strong and supply is broadly balanced to demand. Although annual rental payments under the majority of our leases are not based expressly on the quality or profitability of our tenants' harvests, any of these factors could adversely affect our tenants' ability to meet their obligations to us and our ability to lease or re-lease properties on favorable terms.\nInterest Rates\nWe expect that future changes in interest rates will impact our overall operating performance by, among other things, increasing our borrowing costs. While we may seek to manage our exposure to future changes in rates through interest rate swap agreements or interest rate caps, portions of our overall outstanding debt will likely remain at floating rates. In addition, a sustained material increase in interest rates may cause farmland prices to decline if the rise in real interest rates (which is defined as nominal interest rates minus the inflation rate) is not accompanied by rises in the general levels of inflation. However, our business model anticipates that the value of our farmland will increase, as it has in the past, at a rate that is equal to or greater than the rate of inflation, which may in part offset the impact of rising interest rates on the value of our farmland, but there can be no guarantee that this appreciation will occur to the extent that we anticipate or at all.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions. We have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in the notes to the historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this filing. We have set forth below those accounting policies that we believe require material subjective or complex judgments and have\nthe most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis, based on information that is then available to us, our experience and various matters that we believe are reasonable and appropriate for consideration under the circumstances.\nReal Estate Acquisitions\nWe account for all acquisitions in accordance with the business combinations standard. When we acquire farmland that was previously operated as a rental property, we evaluate whether a lease is in place or a crop is being produced at the time of closing of the acquisition. If a lease is in place or a crop is being produced at the time of acquisition, we account for the transaction as a business combination and charge the costs associated with the acquisition to acquisition and due diligence costs on the Consolidated Statement of Operations as incurred. Otherwise, acquisitions with no lease in place or crops being produced at the time of acquisition are accounted for as asset acquisitions with the transaction costs incurred capitalized to the assets acquired. When we acquire farmland in a sale-lease back transaction with newly originated leases entered into with the seller, we account for the transaction as an asset acquisition and capitalize the transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition.\nUpon acquisition of real estate, we allocate the purchase price of the real estate based upon the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired, which historically have consisted of land, drainage improvements, irrigation improvements, groundwater, permanent plantings (bushes, shrubs, vines, perennials) and grain facilities and may also consist of intangible assets including in-place leases, above market and below market leases and tenant relationships. We allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the tangible assets of acquired real estate by valuing the land as if it were unimproved. We value improvements, including permanent plantings and grain facilities, at replacement cost as new adjusted for depreciation.\nOur estimates of land value are made using a comparable sales analysis. Factors considered by us in our analysis of land value include soil types and water availability and the sales prices of comparable farms. Our estimates of groundwater value are made using historical information obtained regarding the applicable aquifer. Factors considered by us in our analysis of groundwater value are related to the location of the aquifer and whether or not the aquifer is a depletable resource or a replenishing resource. If the aquifer is a replenishing resource, no value is allocated to the groundwater. We include an estimate of property taxes in the purchase price allocation of acquisitions to account for the expected liability that was assumed.\nWhen above or below market leases are acquired, we value the intangible assets based on the present value of the difference between prevailing market rates and the in-place rates measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases that are considered bargain renewal options. The above market lease values will be amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining term of the respective leases. The fair value of acquired below market leases, included in deferred revenue on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, is amortized as an increase of rental income on a straight-line basis over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases, plus the terms of any below market fixed rate renewal options that are considered bargain renewal options of the respective leases.\nThe purchase price is allocated to in-place lease values and tenant relationships, if they are acquired, based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and our overall relationship with the tenant. The value of in-place lease intangibles and tenant relationships will be included as components of deferred leasing intangibles, and will be amortized over the remaining lease term (and expected renewal periods of the respective leases for tenant relationships) as amortization expense. If a tenant terminates its lease prior to its stated expiration, any unamortized amounts relating to that lease, including (i) above and below market leases, (ii) in-place lease values, and (iii) tenant relationships, would be recorded to revenue or expense as appropriate. We capitalize acquisition costs and due diligence costs if the asset is expected to qualify as an asset acquisition. If the asset acquisition is abandoned, the capitalized asset acquisition costs will be expensed to acquisition and due diligence costs in the period of abandonment. If we subsequently determine a previously expected asset acquisition is deemed a business combination, the previously capitalized costs are expensed.\nTotal consideration for acquisitions may include a combination of cash and equity securities. When equity securities are issued, we determine the fair value of the equity securities issued based on the number of shares of common stock and\nOP units issued multiplied by the stock price on the date of closing in the case of common stock and OP units, and on liquidation preference in the case of Preferred units.\nUsing information available at the time of acquisition, we allocate the total consideration to tangible assets and liabilities and identified intangible assets and liabilities. We may adjust the preliminary purchase price allocations after obtaining more information about asset valuations and liabilities assumed.\nReal Estate\nOur real estate consists of land, groundwater and improvements made to the land consisting of grain facilities, irrigation improvements, other assets and drainage improvements. We record real estate at cost and capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life or improve the efficiency of the asset. We expense costs of repairs and maintenance as such costs are incurred. We begin depreciating assets when the asset is ready for its intended use. We compute depreciation and depletion for assets classified as improvements using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 10-40 years for grain facilities, 2-40 years for irrigation improvements, 27-65 for drainage improvements, 3-50 years for groundwater, 13-23 years for permanent plantings, and 5-40 years for other assets acquired. We periodically evaluate the estimated useful lives for groundwater based on current state water regulations and depletion levels of the aquifers.\nWhen a sale occurs, we recognize the associated gain when all consideration has been transferred, the sale has closed, and there is no material continuing involvement. If a sale is expected to generate a loss, we first assess it through the impairment evaluation process. See \u2018\u2018-Impairment of Real Estate Assets'' below.\nImpairment of Real Estate Assets\nWe evaluate our tangible and identifiable intangible real estate assets for impairment indicators whenever events such as declines in a property's operating performance, deteriorating market conditions, or environmental or legal concerns bring recoverability of the carrying value of one or more assets into question. If such events are present, we project the total undiscounted cash flows of the asset, including proceeds from disposition, and compare it to the net book value of the asset. If this evaluation indicates that the carrying value may not be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded in earnings equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. There have been no impairments recognized on real estate assets in the accompanying financial statements.\nInventory of our TRS\nThe costs of growing crop are accumulated until the time of harvest at the lower of cost or market value and are included in inventory in our consolidated financial statements. Costs are allocated to growing crops based on a percentage of the total costs of production and total operating costs that are attributable to the portion of the crops that remain in inventory at the end of the year. Growing crop consists primarily of land preparation, cultivation, irrigation and fertilization costs incurred by FPI Agribusiness. Growing crop inventory is charged to cost of products sold when the related crop is harvested and sold.\nHarvested crop inventory includes costs accumulated during both the growing and harvesting phases and is stated at the lower of those costs or the estimated net realizable value, which is the market price, based upon the nearest market in the geographic region, less any cost of disposition. Cost of disposition includes broker's commissions, freight and other marketing costs.\nOther inventory, such as fertilizer and pesticides, is valued at the lower of cost or market.\nRevenue Recognition\nRental income includes rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of its lease. Minimum rents pursuant to leases are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including renewal options in the case of bargain renewal options. Deferred revenue includes the cumulative difference between the rental revenue recorded on a\nstraight-line basis and the cash rent received from tenants in accordance with the lease terms. Acquired below market leases are included in deferred revenue on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, which are amortized into rental income over the life of the respective leases, plus the terms of the below market renewal options, if any.\nLeases in place as of December 31, 2016 had terms ranging from one to ten years. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had three leases with rent escalations. The majority of the Company's leases provide for a fixed annual or semi-annual cash rent payment. Tenant leases on acquired farms generally require the tenant to pay the Company rent for the entire initial year regardless of the date of acquisition, if the acquisition is closed prior to, or shortly after, planting of crops. If the acquisition is closed later in the year, the Company typically receives a partial rent payment or no rent payment at all.\nCertain of the Company's leases provide for a rent payment determined as a percentage of the gross farm proceeds or a percentage of harvested crops. As of December 31, 2016, a majority of such leases provided for a rent payment determined as a percentage of the gross farm proceeds. Revenue under leases providing for a payment equal to a percentage of the harvested crop or a percentage of the gross farm proceeds are recorded at the guaranteed crop insurance minimums and recognized ratably over the lease term during the crop year. Upon notification from the grain facility that grain has been delivered in the Company's name, a future contract for delivery of the harvest has been finalized or when the tenant has notified the Company of the total amount of gross farm proceeds, revenue is recognized.\nCertain of the Company's leases provide for minimum cash rent plus a bonus based on gross farm proceeds. Revenue under this type of lease is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term based on the minimum cash rent. Bonus rent is recognized upon notification from the tenant of the gross farm proceeds for the year.\nTenant reimbursements include reimbursements for real estate taxes that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of its lease. When leases require that the tenant reimburse the Company for property taxes paid by the Company, the reimbursement is reflected as tenant reimbursement revenue on the statements of operations, as earned, and the related property tax as property operating expense, as incurred. When a lease requires that the tenant pay the taxing authority directly, the Company does not incur this cost. If and when it becomes probable that a tenant will not be able to bear the property-related costs, the Company will accrue the estimated expense.\nThe Company records revenue from the sale of harvested crops when the harvested crop has been contracted to be delivered to a grain facility and title has transferred. Harvested crops delivered under marketing contracts are recorded using the fixed price of the marketing contract at the time of delivery to a grain facility. Harvested crops delivered without a marketing contract are recorded using the market price at the date the harvested crop is delivered to the grain facility and title has transferred.\nThe Company recognizes interest income on notes receivable on an accrual basis over the life of the note. Direct origination costs are netted against loan origination fees and are amortized over the life of the note using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method, as an adjustment to interest income which is included in operating revenues as a component of other revenue in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nAs a REIT, for income tax purposes we are permitted to deduct dividends paid to our stockholders, thereby eliminating the U.S. federal taxation of income represented by such distributions at the Company level, provided certain requirements are met. REITs are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates.\nThe Operating Partnership leases certain of its farms to the TRS, which is subject to federal and state income taxes. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities and their respective income tax basis and for operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards based on enacted income tax rates\nexpected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. However, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not they will be realized on consideration of available evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies. There was $31,996 in taxable income from the TRS for the year ended December 31, 2016, and no taxable income at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nWe perform an annual review for any uncertain tax positions and, if necessary, will record future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements. An uncertain tax position is defined as a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that is not based on clear and unambiguous tax law and which is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods. At December 31, 2016, we did not identify any uncertain tax positions.\nWhen we acquire a property in a business combination, we evaluate such acquisition for any related deferred tax assets or liabilities and determine if a deferred tax asset or liability should be recorded in conjunction with the purchase price allocation. If a built-in gain is acquired, we evaluate the required holding period (generally 5-10 years) and determine if we have the ability and intent to hold the underlying assets for the necessary holding period. If we have the ability to hold the underlying assets for the required holding period, no deferred tax liability will be recorded with respect to the built-in gain.\nNew or Revised Accounting Standards\nFor a summary of the new or revised accounting standards please refer to Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies\u201d within the notes to the combined consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2015\nTable 113: <table> <tr>

26 acquisitions that took place in 2015, primarily in the fourth quarter, in addition to the 24 acquisitions that took place throughout 2016. To highlight the effect of changes due to acquisitions, we have separately discussed the rental income for the same-property portfolio, which includes only properties owned and operated for the entirety of both periods presented.\nTotal rental income under leases for the same-property portfolio increased to $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as a result of average annual rent for the same-property portfolio increasing year over year to $209 per acre in 2016 from $203 in 2015.\nTotal rental income increased $16.1 million, or 119.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year. This increase was the result of the 50 acquisitions completed over the last two years and payments received in connection with the the early termination of certain leases in December 2016. As part of the termination, the Company recognized $3.7 million due to cash received under the contract greater than rental income previously recognized and $2.8 million in early termination fees. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the average annual cash rent for the entire portfolio increased to $224 per acre from $215 per acre in 2015.\nLeases in place in 2015 that provide for tenant payment of property taxes required the tenant to reimburse us for the tax amount we paid in 2016 for the 2015 taxable year. Due to changes in terms of lease renewals and certain outstanding leases, tenant reimbursements increased $0.1 million, or 94.8%, in 2016, as compared to 2015.\nOther revenue increased $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The income recognized in 2016 consisted of $0.8 million realized on crop sales from our TRS's farming operation, in addition to $0.2 million earned on interest and amortization of net loan fees, primarily from loans outstanding under the FPI Loan Program. The TRS was formed in March 2015 with the sales recognized in the first quarter of 2016 representing the first revenues generated by the entity. The FPI Loan Program was launched in August 2015 and has mortgage notes receivable totaling $2.8 million as of December 31, 2016.\nDepreciation and depletion expense increased $0.7 million, or 74.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is the result of acquiring or constructing $14 million in depreciable assets throughout 2016.\nProperty operating expenses increased $1.3 million or 115.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, of which $0.8 million is attributable to an increase in property taxes and $0.2 million to an increase in property insurance primarily as a result of property acquisitions. The increase also included a $0.3 million increase in a variety of other property operating costs such as repairs and maintenance, state and franchise taxes and other miscellaneous items.\nAcquisition and due diligence costs totaled $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $0.3 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2015. Acquisition and due diligence costs recognized in the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of $2.4 million of costs related to the AFCO Mergers, with the remainder related to other acquisitions.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $2.8 million, or 67.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased costs related to the continued growth of our portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2016, employee compensation expenses increased $2.3 million, as compared with the same period in 2015, due to an increase in the number of employees from 12 at the end of 2015 to 15 at the end of 2016. Included in compensation costs is $0.1 million for the new employee benefits program, which was not in place as of December 31, 2015. During 2016, our public company costs increased $0.3 million due to increased investor relations, regulatory and compliance activity, and conference attendance. We also had a $0.2 million increase in travel and office rent expense in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year.\nLegal and accounting expenses increased $0.4 million, or 32.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015. Costs associated with general corporate matters and the growth of our portfolio, including costs related to the AFCO Mergers, contributed to the increase in legal and accounting expenses.\nOther operating expenses totaled $0.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to no other operating expenses recognized in 2015, related to the cost of sales realized on crop sales from our TRS's farming operations.\nOther income, which is comprised primarily of income recognized on the sale of easements and rights-of-way, increased by $0.2 million, or 243.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015.\nInterest expense increased by $5.3 million or 115.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. We recognized additional interest expense of approximately $2.4 million during 2016 related to interest and amortization of deferred loan fees associated with the $53.0 million Bridge Loan (as defined below under Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d), as all costs related to the Bridge Loan were both incurred and amortized during 2016. The increase in interest expense is due, in large part, to interest on the Bridge Loan of $2.3 million, which we do not expect to continue as we do not expect to enter into similar short term financing arrangements in the future. Interest expense increased approximately $3.1 million as the result of an increase in our outstanding borrowings during 2016, which were $309.9 million as of December 31, 2016 and $187.2 million for the comparative period in 2015. These increases were partially offset by the amortization of deferred financing fees and discounts/premiums on debt which increased $0.1 million during 2016.\nComparison of the year ended December 31,

To highlight the effect of changes due to acquisitions, we have separately discussed the rental income for the same-property portfolio, which includes only properties owned and operated for the entirety of both periods presented.\nTotal rental income increased $9.6 million, or 241.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily the result of the 55 acquisitions completed over the last two years. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the average annual cash rent for the entire portfolio increased to $209 per acre from $179 per acre in 2014. This increase was the result of diversification of our portfolio to new markets.\nCash rental income for the same-property portfolio remained consistent at $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $2.6 million for 2014, as a result of average annual rent for the same-property portfolio decreasing to $357 per acre in 2015 from $360 per acre in 2014. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower crop share rent in 2015.\nLeases in place in 2014 that provide for tenant payment of property taxes required the tenant to reimburse us for the tax amount we paid in 2015 for the 2014 taxable year. Due to changes in terms of lease renewals, as well as of certain outstanding leases, tenant reimbursements decreased $0.1 million, or 45.6%, in 2015, as compared to 2014.\nOther revenues totaled $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to no other revenues recognized in 2014. The other revenues recognized during 2015 were generated on interest and amortization of net loan fees, primarily from the FPI Loan Program, launched in August 2015.\nDepreciation and depletion expense increased $0.6 million, or 171.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is the result of acquiring $7.5 million in depreciable assets in the last quarter of 2014, $7.0 million in depreciable assets throughout 2015 and investing $5.6 million in property improvements on acquired property during 2015.\nProperty operating expenses increased $0.9 million, or 343.4%, for the 2015 year, as compared to the prior year, of which $0.2 million is attributable to properties acquired during 2015. The remaining increase in property operating expenses is primarily related to increases in property insurance of $0.1 million, property taxes of $0.2 million, state franchise taxes of $0.1 million, and repairs of $0.1 million. Also increasing during the year were travel costs related to property visits on newly acquired properties of $0.1 million and $0.1 million of expenses for legal costs related to tenant issues.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $1.9 million, or 84.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in general and administrative expenses was largely the result of increased costs related to being a public company and our continued growth. We only incurred the costs of being a public company during the period following our IPO in 2014, while we incurred such costs for the entire year in 2015. During 2015, our public company costs increased $0.3 million due to increased investor relations, board, regulatory and compliance activity, stock-based compensation expense increased $0.2 million, conference attendance and travel expenses increased $0.3 million, consulting fees increased $0.2 million, and other corporate costs increased $0.02 million, due to increased rent and general office expenses related to increased headcount, as compared with the same period in 2014. Also contributing to the general and administrative increase during the year ended December 31, 2015 were employee compensation expenses, which increased $1.1 million as compared with the same period in 2014 as we did not have any employees prior to the IPO and have since increased our staffing to 13 employees and added a formal bonus program in the third quarter of 2014. These increases were offset by a decrease of $0.2 million in professional fees which were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014, on behalf of the Company by Pittman Hough Farms prior to the completion of the IPO.\nLegal and accounting expenses increased $0.5 million, or 77.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of being a public company for a full year with the Company going public in April 2014. Also contributing to the increase in legal and accounting expenses were general corporate matters and the growth of our portfolio.\nOther income decreased by $0.05 million, or 31.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. During both periods other income was recognized on the sale of easements and right-of-way.\nInterest expense increased by $3.2 million or 236.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of an increase in our average outstanding borrowings, which were $159.2 million\nduring the year December 31, 2015 and $44.4 million for 2014. Our weighted average cost of borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 2.80% and 2.76%, respectively. We also recognized additional interest expense of $0.2 million and $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to the amortization of deferred loan fees. These increases were partially offset by the amortization of a premium on our debt of $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay any outstanding borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, make distributions to our stockholders and to OP unitholders, and other general business needs.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to acquire additional farmland and make other investments consistent with our investment strategy, make principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings, make distributions necessary to qualify for taxation as a REIT and fund our operations. Our sources of funds primarily will be cash on hand, operating cash flows and borrowings from prospective lenders.\nDuring 2017, $81.2 million of our borrowings will mature. Any cash that we use to satisfy our outstanding debt obligations will reduce the amounts available to acquire additional farms, which could adversely affect our growth prospects. The Company has $45.0 million and $3.1 million in capacity available under the Rutledge and Farm Credit of Central Florida facilities. Within twelve months of this Annual Report, $81.2 million of our borrowings will mature. We anticipate refinancing the debt due to mature in 2017 with the same or similar financial institutions and we are currently in discussions with existing lenders to do so. However, we can provide no assurances that we will be able to refinance the debt on similar terms or at all and thus alternative sources of capital may be necessary. To date, no such capital sources have been identified. As of December 31, 2016, we had $309.9 million of debt, which may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations, restrict our operations and our ability to grow our business and revenues and restrict our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. We plan to refinance these loans in 2017.\nIn connection with the AFCO Mergers, at the effective time of the Company Merger, each share of AFCO Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Company Merger (other than any shares of AFCO Common Stock owned by any wholly owned subsidiary of AFCO or by us or the Operating Partnership or any wholly owned subsidiary of us or the Operating Partnership), automatically converted into the right to receive, subject to certain adjustments, 0.7417 shares of our common stock. In addition, in connection with the Company Merger, each outstanding AFCO restricted stock unit that had become fully earned and vested in accordance with its terms, at the effective time of the Company Merger, was converted into the right to receive 0.7417 shares of our common stock. At the effective time of the Partnership Merger, each common unit of limited partnership interest in AFCO OP issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Partnership Merger, was converted automatically into the right to receive, subject to certain adjustments, 0.7417 OP units. We issued 14,763,604 shares of our common stock as consideration in the Company Merger and 17,373 shares of our common stock in respect of fully earned and vested AFCO restricted stock units. We issued 218,525 OP units in connection with the Partnership Merger.\nIn addition to utilizing current and any future available borrowings, we entered into equity distribution agreements on September 15, 2015 in connection with the ATM Program, under which the Company has issued and sold from time to time, through the sales agents, shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $25 million. Through December 31, 2016 the Company has generated $11.1 million in net cash proceeds under the ATM Program is intended to provide cost-effective financing alternatives in the capital markets and we intend to use the net proceeds from the ATM Program, if any, for future farmland acquisitions in accordance with our investment strategy and for general corporate purposes, which may also include originating loans to farmers under our loan program. We only intend to utilize the ATM Program if the market price of our common stock reaches levels which are deemed appropriate by our Board of Directors.\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to acquire additional farmland, make other investments and certain long-term capital expenditures, make principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings, and make distributions necessary to qualify for taxation as a REIT. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, including future equity issuances (including issuances of OP units), net cash provided by operations, long-term mortgage indebtedness and other secured and unsecured borrowings.\nOur ability to incur additional debt will depend on a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets, compliance with the covenants under our existing debt agreements, borrowing restrictions that may be imposed by lenders and the conditions of debt markets. Our ability to access the equity capital markets will depend on a number of factors as well, including general market conditions for REITs and market perceptions about our company.\nConsolidated Indebtedness\nFirst Midwest Bank Indebtedness\nIn connection with our initial public offering and the related formation transactions, on April 16, 2014, the Operating Partnership, as borrower, and First Midwest Bank, as lender, entered into the FMW Loan Agreement, which provided for loans in the initial aggregate principal amount of approximately $30,780,000. In April 2016 we fully repaid our debt under this loan.\nFarmer Mac Facility\nWe are party to the Amended and Restated Bond Purchase Agreement, dated as of March 1, 2015 and amended on June 2, 2015 and August 3, 2015 (the Bond Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation ( Farmer Mac\u201d) and Farmer Mac Mortgage Securities Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Farmer Mac, as bond purchaser (the Purchaser\u201d), regarding a secured bond purchase facility (the Farmer Mac Facility\u201d) that has a maximum borrowing capacity of $165 million. Pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement, the Operating Partnership may, from time to time, issue one or more bonds to the Purchaser that will be secured by pools of mortgage loans, which will, in turn, be secured by first liens on agricultural real estate owned by us. The mortgage loans may have effective loan-to-value ratios of up to 60%, after giving effect to the overcollateralization obligations described below. Prepayment of each bond issuance is not permitted unless otherwise agreed upon by all parties to the Bond Purchase Agreement.\nThe Operating Partnership's ability to borrow under the Farmer Mac Facility is subject to our ongoing compliance with a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants, as well as financial covenants, including: a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 60%; a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.5 to 1.00; and a minimum tangible net worth. On August 3, 2015, we amended the Bond Purchase Agreement in order to calculate the fixed charge coverage ratio using our Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Bond Purchase Agreement) rather than our EBITDA (as defined in the Bond Purchase Agreement). We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under the Farmer Mac Facility at December 31, 2016.\nIn connection with the Bond Purchase Agreement, on March 1, 2015, we and the Operating Partnership also entered into a pledge and security agreement (as amended and restated, the Pledge Agreement\u201d) in favor of the Purchaser and Farmer Mac, pursuant to which we and the Operating Partnership agreed to pledge, as collateral for the Farmer Mac Facility, all of their respective right, title and interest in (i) mortgage loans with a value at least equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding bond held by the Purchaser and (ii) such additional collateral as necessary to have total collateral with a value at least equal to 110% of the outstanding notes held by the Purchaser. In addition, we agreed to guarantee the full performance of the Operating Partnership's duties and obligations under the Pledge Agreement.\nThe Bond Purchase Agreement and the Pledge Agreement include customary events of default, the occurrence of any of which, after any applicable cure period, would permit the Purchaser and Farmer Mac to, among other things, accelerate payment of all amounts outstanding under the Farmer Mac Facility and to exercise its remedies with respect to the pledged collateral, including foreclosure and sale of the agricultural real estate underlying the pledged mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2016, we had $155.5 million outstanding under the Farmer Mac Facility.\nBridge Loan\nOn February 29, 2016, two wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership (together, the Bridge Borrower\u201d) entered into a term loan agreement (the Bridge Loan Agreement\u201d) with MSD FPI Partners, LLC, an affiliate of MSD Partners, L.P. (the Bridge Lender\u201d), that provided for a loan of $53.0 million (the Bridge Loan\u201d), the proceeds of which were used primarily to fund the cash portion of the consideration for the acquisition of the Forsythe farms, which was completed on March 2, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company accrued and paid debt issuance costs on the Bridge Loan totaling $173,907 and interest totaling $2,271,867, of which $2,120,000, or 4.0%, of the Bridge Loan's principal amount was considered additional interest paid as discount on issuance. The Bridge Loan was paid in full, including accrued interest, and without prepayment penalty, on March 29, 2016 using proceeds from the MetLife Term Loans, as described below.\nMetLife Term Loans\nOn March 29, 2016, five wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership entered into the loan agreement (the First MetLife Loan Agreement\u201d and together with the Second MetLife Loan Agreement, the Fifth MetLife Loan Agreement and the Sixth MetLife Loan Agreement, the MetLife Loan Agreements\u201d), which provides a total of $127 million of term loans, comprised of (i) a $90 million term loan ( Term Loan 1\u201d), (ii) a $16.0 million term loan ( Term Loan 2\u201d) and (iii) a $21.0 million term loan ( Term Loan 3\u201d and, together with Term Loan 1 and Term Loan 2, the Initial MetLife Term Loans\u201d and, together with Term Loan 4 (as defined in the subsequent paragraph), the MetLife Term Loans). The proceeds of the MetLife Term Loans were used to repay existing debt (including amounts outstanding under the existing Bridge Loan agreement) to acquire additional properties and for general corporate purposes. Each initial Metlife Term Loan matures on March 29, 2026 and is secured by first lien mortgages on certain of our properties.\nOn June 29, 2016, five wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership entered into a loan agreement (the Second MetLife Loan Agreement\u201d) with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ( MetLife\u201d), which provides for a loan of approximately $15.7 million (the Term Loan 4\u201d) to the Company with a maturity date of June 29, 2026.

NAREIT defines FFO as net income (loss) (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, plus real estate related depreciation, depletion and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. Management presents FFO as a supplemental performance measure because it believes that FFO is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance. Specifically, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating properties, which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also\nbelieve that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs.\nHowever, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the operating performance of improvements on our properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. In addition, other equity REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or service indebtedness. FFO also should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP.\nWe do not, however, believe that FFO is the only measure of the sustainability of our operating performance. Changes in GAAP accounting and reporting rules that were put in effect after the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO in 1999 result in the inclusion of a number of items in FFO that do not correlate with the sustainability of our operating performance. Therefore, in addition to FFO, we present AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted, both of which are non-GAAP measures. Management considers AFFO a useful supplemental performance metric for investors as it is more indicative of the Company's operational performance than FFO. AFFO is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period, and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance. Even AFFO, however, does not properly capture the timing of cash receipts, especially in connection with full-year rent payments under lease agreements entered into in connection with newly acquired farms. Management considers AFFO per share, fully diluted to be a supplemental metric to GAAP earnings per share. AFFO per share, fully diluted provides additional insight into how our operating performance could be allocated to potential shares outstanding at a specific point in time. Management believes that AFFO is a widely recognized measure of the operations of REITs, and presenting AFFO will enable investors to assess our performance in comparison to other REITs. However, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted and, accordingly, our AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted may not always be comparable to AFFO and AFFO per share amounts calculated by other REITs. AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or earnings per share (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or as an alternative to net income (loss) earnings per share (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor are they indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions.\nAFFO is calculated by adjusting FFO to exclude or include the income and expenses that we believe are not reflective of the sustainability of our ongoing operating performance, as further explained below:\nTable 154: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nReal estate related acquisition and due diligence costs. Acquisition (including audit fees associated with these acquisitions) and due diligence costs are incurred for investment purposes and therefore, do not correlate with the ongoing operations of our portfolio. We believe that excluding these costs from AFFO provides useful supplemental information reflective of the realized economic impact of our leases, which is useful in assessing the sustainability of our operating performance. Acquisition and due diligence costs totaled $2.5 million, $0.3 million and $0.2 million for the years December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Real estate related acquisition and due diligence costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $2.3 million in interest and loan fees associated with the short-term Bridge Loan and the Forsythe acquisition and as the interest and fees are a non-recurring item they have been excluded from the AFFO calculation. Included in the $2.3 million of interest and loan fees is only a portion of the interest, approximately $2.1 million, or 4% of the Bridge Loan's principal amount, which was considered additional interest paid as discount on issuance. A portion of the audit fees we incur are directly related to acquisitions, which varies with the number and complexity of the acquisitions we evaluate and complete in a given period. As such, these costs do not correlate with the ongoing operations of our portfolio. Total acquisition related audit fees excluded from AFFO totaled $0.3 million, $0.2 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We believe that excluding these costs from AFFO provides useful supplemental information reflective of the realized economic impact of our current acquisition strategy, which is useful in assessing the sustainability of our operating performance.

The conversion of Preferred units is excluded from the calculation of common shares fully diluted as they are not participating securities, thus don't share in the performance of the Company and their impact on shares outstanding is uncertain.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn prior periods, our calculation of AFFO also adjusted FFO to reflect the difference between the pro rata contractual cash revenue for each crop year spread equally over the quarterly periods of ownership (without regard to the date of acquisition within the quarter) and the rent recognized on a straight-line basis in accordance with GAAP. In prior filings with the SEC, we referred to this adjustment as crop-year revenue adjustment.\u201d For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the crop-year revenue adjustment was $1.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively.

respectively.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) is a key financial measure used to evaluate our operating performance but should not be construed as an alternative to operating income, cash flows from operating activities or net income, in each case as determined in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is not a measure defined in accordance with GAAP. We believe that EBITDA is a standard performance measure commonly reported and widely used by analysts and investors in our industry. However, while EBITDA is a performance measure widely used across several industries, we do not believe that it correctly captures our business operating performance because it includes non-cash expenses and recurring adjustments that are necessary to better understand our business operating performance. Therefore, in addition to EBITDA, our management uses adjusted EBITDA ( Adjusted EBITDA\u201d), a non-GAAP measure.\nWe further adjust EBITDA for certain additional items such as stock based compensation, indirect offering costs, real estate acquisition related audit fees and real estate related acquisition and due diligence costs (for a full discussion of these adjustments see AFFO adjustments discussed above) that we consider necessary to understand our operating performance. As of September 30, 2015, we began excluding indirect offering costs from EBITDA as we believe it improves\ncomparability of our results over each reporting period and of our company with other real estate operators. Prior to this date the Company had not incurred any indirect offering costs. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance that, when considered with net income and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's understanding of our operating performance.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nTable 162: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAlthough depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for these replacements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOther companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting the usefulness as a comparative measure.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results of operations and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA only as a supplemental measure of our performance.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of our net income (loss) to our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated below (unaudited):\nTable 167: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,999 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,689 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(671) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,959 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,616 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,372 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation and depletion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,554 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n17,523 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,208 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,030 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStock based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,224 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIndirect equity offering costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReal estate related acquisition and due diligence costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,789 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n21,624 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,678 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,089 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInflation\nAll of the leases for the farmland in our portfolio have one- to five-year terms, with the exception of two that have ten-year terms, pursuant to which each tenant is responsible for substantially all of the operating expenses related to the property, including taxes, maintenance, water usage and insurance. As a result, we believe that the effect on us of inflationary increases in operating expenses may be offset in part by the operating expenses that are passed through to our tenants and by contractual rent increases because our leases will be renegotiated every one to five years. We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our historical financial position or results of operations.\nSeasonality\nBecause the leases for a many of the properties in our portfolio require significant payments in advance of the spring planting season, we receive a significant portion of our cash rental payments in the first calendar quarter of each year, although we recognize rental revenue from these leases on a pro rata basis over the non-cancellable term of the lease in accordance with GAAP.", "item_7_truncated": "General and administrative expenses increased $2.8 million, or 67.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased costs related to the continued growth of our portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2016, employee compensation expenses increased $2.3 million, as compared with the same period in 2015, due to an increase in the number of employees from 12 at the end of 2015 to 15 at the end of 2016. Included in compensation costs is $0.1 million for the new employee benefits program, which was not in place as of December 31, 2015. During 2016, our public company costs increased $0.3 million due to increased investor relations, regulatory and compliance activity, and conference attendance. We also had a $0.2 million increase in travel and office rent expense in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year.\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Although farmland prices may show a decline from time to time, we believe that any reduction in U.S. farmland values overall is likely to be short-lived as global demand for food and agricultural commodities typically exceeds global supply. In addition, although prices for many crops experienced significant declines in 2014 and 2015, we do not believe that such declines represent a trend that will continue over the long term. Rather, we believe that long-term growth trends in global population and GDP per capita will result in increased prices for primary crops over time.\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Operating Partnership each entered into a separate guaranty (the Initial MetLife Guaranties\u201d) whereby the Company and the Operating Partnership jointly and severally agreed to unconditionally guarantee all of the borrowers' obligations under the First MetLife Loan Agreement.\nIn connection with the AFCO Mergers, at the effective time of the Company Merger, each share of AFCO Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Company Merger (other than any shares of AFCO Common Stock owned by any wholly owned subsidiary of AFCO or by us or the Operating Partnership or any wholly owned subsidiary of us or the Operating Partnership), automatically converted into the right to receive, subject to certain adjustments, 0.7417 shares of our common stock. In addition, in connection with the Company Merger, each outstanding AFCO restricted stock unit that had become fully earned and vested in accordance with its terms, at the effective time of the Company Merger, was converted into the right to receive 0.7417 shares of our common stock. At the effective time of the Partnership Merger, each common unit of limited partnership interest in AFCO OP issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Partnership Merger, was converted automatically into the right to receive, subject to certain adjustments, 0.7417 OP units. We issued 14,763,604 shares of our common stock as consideration in the Company Merger and 17,373 shares of our common stock in respect of fully earned and vested AFCO restricted stock units. We issued 218,525 OP units in connection with the Partnership Merger.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nWe elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our short taxable year ended December 31, 2014.\nAll of the leases for the farmland in our portfolio have one- to five-year terms, with the exception of two that have ten-year terms, pursuant to which each tenant is responsible for substantially all of the operating expenses related to the property, including taxes, maintenance, water usage and insurance. As a result, we believe that the effect on us of inflationary increases in operating expenses may be offset in part by the operating expenses that are passed through to our tenants and by contractual rent increases because our leases will be renegotiated every one to five years. We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our historical financial position or results of operations.\nInterest on Term Loan 2 and Term Loan 3 is payable in cash semi-annually and accrues at an initial rate of 2.66% per annum, which may be adjusted by MetLife on each of March 29, 2019, March 29, 2022 and March 29, 2025 to an interest rate consistent with interest rates quoted by MetLife for substantially similar loans secured by real estate substantially similar to our properties securing Term Loan 2 and Term Loan 3.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of Net income (loss) to FFO, AFFO and net income available to common stockholders per share to AFFO per share, fully diluted, the most directly comparable GAAP equivalents, respectively, for the periods indicated below (unaudited):\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2015\nOur rental income for 2015 was impacted by the 29 acquisitions that took place in 2014, primarily in the fourth quarter, in addition to the 26 acquisitions that took place throughout 2015. To highlight the effect of changes due to acquisitions, we have separately discussed the rental income for the same-property portfolio, which includes only properties owned and operated for the entirety of both periods presented.\nMerger with American Farmland Company\ncause landowners to benefit economically from using the land for farming rather than alternative uses. We also believe that decreases in the amount of arable land in the United States and globally as a result of increasing urbanization will partially offset the impact of additional supply of farmland. The global supply of food is also impacted by the productivity per acre of tillable land. Historically, productivity gains (measured by average crop yields) have been driven by advances in seed technology, farm equipment, irrigation techniques and chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Furthermore, we expect the increasing shortage of water in many irrigated growing regions in the United States and other growing regions around the globe, often as a result of new water restrictions imposed by laws or regulations, to lead to decreased productivity growth on many acres and, in some cases, cause yields to decline on those acres.\nOther operating expenses totaled $0.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to no other operating expenses recognized in 2015, related to the cost of sales realized on crop sales from our TRS's farming operations.\nFirst Midwest Bank Indebtedness\nRevenue Recognition\n2016, and on the first day of each month thereafter. Proceeds from the Farm Credit Mortgage Note are to be used for the acquisition and development of additional farms.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $2.7 million, primarily as a result of the following:\n\nWe expect that future changes in interest rates will impact our overall operating performance by, among other things, increasing our borrowing costs. While we may seek to manage our exposure to future changes in rates through interest rate swap agreements or interest rate caps, portions of our overall outstanding debt will likely remain at floating rates. In addition, a sustained material increase in interest rates may cause farmland prices to decline if the rise in real interest rates (which is defined as nominal interest rates minus the inflation rate) is not accompanied by rises in the general levels of inflation. However, our business model anticipates that the value of our farmland will increase, as it has in the past, at a rate that is equal to or greater than the rate of inflation, which may in part offset the impact of rising interest rates on the value of our farmland, but there can be no guarantee that this appreciation will occur to the extent that we anticipate or at all.\nOverview and Background\nCertain of the Company's leases provide for minimum cash rent plus a bonus based on gross farm proceeds. Revenue under this type of lease is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term based on the minimum cash rent. Bonus rent is recognized upon notification from the tenant of the gross farm proceeds for the year.\nWe are an internally managed real estate company that owns and seeks to acquire high-quality farmland located in agricultural markets throughout North America. As of the date of this Annual Report, we own farms with an aggregate of approximately 142,223 acres in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. As of the date of this Annual Report, approximately 75% of the acres in our portfolio are used to grow primary crops, such as corn, soybeans, wheat, rice and cotton, and approximately 25% of the acres in our portfolio produce specialty crops, such as blueberries, vegetables, citrus, nuts and edible beans. We believe our portfolio gives investors exposure to the increasing global food demand trend in the face of growing scarcity of high quality farmland and will reflect the approximate breakdown of U.S. agricultural output between primary crops and animal protein (whose production relies principally on primary crops as feed), on one hand, and specialty crops, on the other.\nFarm leases are often short-term in nature. As of December 31, 2016 our portfolio had the following lease expirations as a percentage of approximate acres leased and annualized minimum cash rents:\nOur revenues are primarily generated from renting farmland to operators of farming businesses. Our leases have terms ranging from one to ten years. Although the majority of our leases do not provide the tenant with a contractual right to renew the lease upon its expiration, we believe it is customary to provide the existing tenant with the opportunity to renew the lease, subject to any increase in the rental rate that we may establish. If the tenant elects not to renew the lease at the end of the lease term, the land will be offered to a new tenant.\n (1) This acquisition closed on March 2, 2016. The purchase price of the property was comprised of (a) $50.0 million in cash, (b) an aggregate of 2,608,695 OP units valued at $11.50 per OP unit and (c) 117,000 Preferred units. See Note 9 - Stockholders' Equity and Non-controlling Interests\u201d. \nIn addition, on February 3, 2017, AFCO OP entered into the Fifth Rutledge Loan Agreement in respect to a senior secured credit facility in the aggregate amount of $30 million, with a maturity date of January 1, 2022 and an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.3%. The Fifth Rutledge Loan Agreement requires AFCO OP to make quarterly interest payments. Additionally, the Fifth Rutledge Loan Agreement requires AFCO OP to pay a quarterly non-usage fee equal to 0.25% of the committed loan amount minus the average outstanding principal balance of the loan amount during the prior three-month period. On February 2, 2017 the Company and the Operating Partnership each entered into separate guarantees (the Fifth Loan Guarantees\u201d and together with the Existing Loan Guarantees, the Guarantees\u201d) whereby they are required to unconditionally guarantee AFCO OP's obligations under the Fifth Rutledge Loan Agreement. Proceeds from Fifth Rutledge Loan will be used to acquire additional properties and for general corporate purposes.\nOur real estate consists of land, groundwater and improvements made to the land consisting of grain facilities, irrigation improvements, other assets and drainage improvements. We record real estate at cost and capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life or improve the efficiency of the asset. We expense costs of repairs and maintenance as such costs are incurred. We begin depreciating assets when the asset is ready for its intended use. We compute depreciation and depletion for assets classified as improvements using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 10-40 years for grain facilities, 2-40 years for irrigation improvements, 27-65 for drainage improvements, 3-50 years for groundwater, 13-23 years for permanent plantings, and 5-40 years for other assets acquired. We periodically evaluate the estimated useful lives for groundwater based on current state water regulations and depletion levels of the aquifers.\nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results of operations and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA only as a supplemental measure of our performance.\nIn connection with the Term Loan 4, on June 29, 2016, the Company and the Operating Partnership each entered into a separate guaranty (the Term Loan 4 Guaranties\u201d) whereby the Company and the Operating Partnership jointly and severally agreed to unconditionally guarantee all of the borrowers' obligations under the Second MetLife Loan Agreement.\nWe expect that global demand for food, driven primarily by significant increases in the global population and GDP per capita, will continue to be the key driver of farmland values. We further expect that global demand for most crops will continue to grow to keep pace with global population growth, which we anticipate will lead to either higher prices and/or higher yields and, therefore, higher rental rates on our farmland, as well as sustained growth in farmland values over the long-term. We also believe that growth in global GDP per capita, particularly in developing nations, will contribute significantly to increasing demand for primary crops. As global GDP per capita increases, the composition of daily caloric intake is expected to shift away from the direct consumption of primary crops toward animal-based proteins, which is expected to result in increased demand for primary crops as feed for livestock. According to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization ( UN FAO\u201d), these factors are expected to require more than one billion additional tons of global annual grain production by 2050, a 45.5% increase from 2005-2007 levels and more than two times the 475 million tons of grain produced in the United States in 2014. Furthermore, we believe that, as GDP per capita grows, a significant portion of additional household income is allocated to food and that once individuals increase consumption of, and spending on, higher quality food, they will strongly resist returning to their former dietary habits, resulting in greater inelasticity in the demand for food. As a result, we believe that, as global demand for food increases, rental rates on our farmland and the value of our farmland will increase over the long-term. Global demand for corn and soybeans as inputs in the production of biofuels such as ethanol and soy diesel also could impact the prices of corn and soybeans, which, in the long-term, could impact our rental revenues and our results of operations. However, the success of our business strategy is not dependent on growth in demand for biofuels and we do not believe that demand for corn and soybeans as inputs in the production of biofuels will materially impact our results of operations or the value of our farmland, primarily because we believe that growth in global population and GDP per capita will be more significant drivers of global demand for primary crops over the long-term.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $23.5 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to $33.7 million at December 31, 2014.\n \u00b7 Aggregate dividend and distribution payments of $5.9 million to common stockholders and OP unitholders made in 2015, compared to aggregate dividends payments and net distributions to members of $2.7 million during 2014; and \nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $5.9 million, primarily as a result of the following:\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of AFFO share information to basic weighted average common shares outstanding, the most directly comparable GAAP equivalent, for the periods indicated below (unaudited):\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2016:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company entered into two separate sale and partial leaseback transactions in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia in December 2014 and June 2015. These leases were due to expire on December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2019. The tenant and the Company agreed to terminate the leases effective as of December 31, 2016. As part of the termination settlement, the tenant agreed to pay an additional rent amount related to 2016 of $2.8 million. In addition, the Company fully recognized as 2016 revenue certain rent payments, totaling $3.7 million, of which the majority was made by the tenant in June 2015, that the Company had not yet recognized under its revenue recognition policy.\nDepreciation and depletion expense increased $0.7 million, or 74.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is the result of acquiring or constructing $14 million in depreciable assets throughout 2016.\nWe do not, however, believe that FFO is the only measure of the sustainability of our operating performance. Changes in GAAP accounting and reporting rules that were put in effect after the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO in 1999 result in the inclusion of a number of items in FFO that do not correlate with the sustainability of our operating performance. Therefore, in addition to FFO, we present AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted, both of which are non-GAAP measures. Management considers AFFO a useful supplemental performance metric for investors as it is more indicative of the Company's operational performance than FFO. AFFO is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period, and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance. Even AFFO, however, does not properly capture the timing of cash receipts, especially in connection with full-year rent payments under lease agreements entered into in connection with newly acquired farms. Management considers AFFO per share, fully diluted to be a supplemental metric to GAAP earnings per share. AFFO per share, fully diluted provides additional insight into how our operating performance could be allocated to potential shares outstanding at a specific point in time. Management believes that AFFO is a widely recognized measure of the operations of REITs, and presenting AFFO will enable investors to assess our performance in comparison to other REITs. However, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted and, accordingly, our AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted may not always be comparable to AFFO and AFFO per share amounts calculated by other REITs. AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or earnings per share (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or as an alternative to net income (loss) earnings per share (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor are they indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nSubject to certain conditions, amounts outstanding under Term Loan 2 and Term Loan 3, as well as any amounts outstanding under Term Loan 1 that are subject to a fixed interest rate, may be prepaid without penalty up to 20% of the\nNew or Revised Accounting Standards\nWhen we acquire a property in a business combination, we evaluate such acquisition for any related deferred tax assets or liabilities and determine if a deferred tax asset or liability should be recorded in conjunction with the purchase price allocation. If a built-in gain is acquired, we evaluate the required holding period (generally 5-10 years) and determine if we have the ability and intent to hold the underlying assets for the necessary holding period. If we have the ability to hold the underlying assets for the required holding period, no deferred tax liability will be recorded with respect to the built-in gain.\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to acquire additional farmland, make other investments and certain long-term capital expenditures, make principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings, and make distributions necessary to qualify for taxation as a REIT. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, including future equity issuances (including issuances of OP units), net cash provided by operations, long-term mortgage indebtedness and other secured and unsecured borrowings.\nWe account for all acquisitions in accordance with the business combinations standard. When we acquire farmland that was previously operated as a rental property, we evaluate whether a lease is in place or a crop is being produced at the time of closing of the acquisition. If a lease is in place or a crop is being produced at the time of acquisition, we account for the transaction as a business combination and charge the costs associated with the acquisition to acquisition and due diligence costs on the Consolidated Statement of Operations as incurred. Otherwise, acquisitions with no lease in place or crops being produced at the time of acquisition are accounted for as asset acquisitions with the transaction costs incurred capitalized to the assets acquired. When we acquire farmland in a sale-lease back transaction with newly originated leases entered into with the seller, we account for the transaction as an asset acquisition and capitalize the transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition.\nthe Company with a maturity date of July 1, 2019 (the Prudential Note\u201d). Interest on the Prudential Note is payable in cash semi-annually and accrues at a fixed rate of 3.20% per annum. Proceeds from the Prudential Note were used to acquire additional properties and for general corporate purposes.\nThe following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nProperty operating expenses increased $1.3 million or 115.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, of which $0.8 million is attributable to an increase in property taxes and $0.2 million to an increase in property insurance primarily as a result of property acquisitions. The increase also included a $0.3 million increase in a variety of other property operating costs such as repairs and maintenance, state and franchise taxes and other miscellaneous items.\n \u00b7 Funding of $2.8 million in notes receivable, which was offset by $0.02 million of net origination fees received for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. \nFarm Credit of Central Florida Mortgage Note\nWe perform an annual review for any uncertain tax positions and, if necessary, will record future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements. An uncertain tax position is defined as a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that is not based on clear and unambiguous tax law and which is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods. At December 31, 2016, we did not identify any uncertain tax positions.\nWhen above or below market leases are acquired, we value the intangible assets based on the present value of the difference between prevailing market rates and the in-place rates measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases that are considered bargain renewal options. The above market lease values will be amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining term of the respective leases. The fair value of acquired below market leases, included in deferred revenue on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, is amortized as an increase of rental income on a straight-line basis over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases, plus the terms of any below market fixed rate renewal options that are considered bargain renewal options of the respective leases.\nThe leases for the majority of the properties in our portfolio provide that tenants must pay us at least 50% (and often 100%) of the annual rent in advance of each spring planting season. As a result, we collect a significant portion of total annual rents in the first calendar quarter of each year. We believe our use of leases pursuant to which at least 50% of the annual rent is payable in advance of each spring planting season mitigates the tenant credit risk associated with the variability of farming operations that could be adversely impacted by poor crop yields, weather conditions, mismanagement, undercapitalization or other factors affecting our tenants. Prior to acquiring farmland property, we take into consideration the competitiveness of the local farm-operator tenant environment in order to enhance our ability to quickly replace a tenant that is unwilling to renew a lease or is unable to pay a rent payment when it is due. Some of our leases provide for a reimbursement of the property taxes we pay. We expect that, going forward, a progressively smaller percentage of our leases will provide for such a reimbursement.\nLegal and accounting expenses increased $0.4 million, or 32.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015. Costs associated with general corporate matters and the growth of our portfolio, including costs related to the AFCO Mergers, contributed to the increase in legal and accounting expenses.\n \u00b7 Real estate related acquisition and due diligence costs. Acquisition (including audit fees associated with these acquisitions) and due diligence costs are incurred for investment purposes and therefore, do not correlate with the ongoing operations of our portfolio. We believe that excluding these costs from AFFO provides useful supplemental information reflective of the realized economic impact of our leases, which is useful in assessing the sustainability of our operating performance. Acquisition and due diligence costs totaled $2.5 million, $0.3 million and $0.2 million for the years December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Real estate related acquisition and due diligence costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $2.3 million in interest and loan fees associated with the short-term Bridge Loan and the Forsythe acquisition and as the interest and fees are a non-recurring item they have been excluded from the AFFO calculation. Included in the $2.3 million of interest and loan fees is only a portion of the interest, approximately $2.1 million, or 4% of the Bridge Loan's principal amount, which was considered additional interest paid as discount on issuance. A portion of the audit fees we incur are directly related to acquisitions, which varies with the number and complexity of the acquisitions we evaluate and complete in a given period. As such, these costs do not correlate with the ongoing operations of our portfolio. Total acquisition related audit fees excluded from AFFO totaled $0.3 million, $0.2 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We believe that excluding these costs from AFFO provides useful supplemental information reflective of the realized economic impact of our current acquisition strategy, which is useful in assessing the sustainability of our operating performance. These \nAs of December 31, 2016, we owned 75.1% of the OP units in the Operating Partnership.\n \u00b7 Increase of $0.6 million in property taxes; \nIn connection with the Term Loan 5, on January 12, 2017, the Company and the Operating Partnership each entered the Term Loan 5 Guaranties whereby the Company and the Operating Partnership jointly and severally agreed to unconditionally guarantee all of the borrowers' obligations under the Fifth MetLife Loan Agreement.\nWhen a sale occurs, we recognize the associated gain when all consideration has been transferred, the sale has closed, and there is no material continuing involvement. If a sale is expected to generate a loss, we first assess it through the impairment evaluation process. See \u2018\u2018-Impairment of Real Estate Assets'' below.\nEach of the MetLife Loan Agreements contains a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants, including the requirement to maintain loan to value ratio of no greater than 60%. The MetLife Guaranties also contain a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants.\nIn connection with the Term Loan 6, on February 14, 2017, the Company and the Operating Partnership each entered into a separate guaranty (the Term Loan 6 Guaranties\u201d) whereby the Company and the Operating Partnership jointly and severally agreed to unconditionally guarantee all of the borrowers' obligations under the Sixth MetLife Loan Agreement.\nLegal and accounting expenses increased $0.5 million, or 77.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of being a public company for a full year with the Company going public in April 2014. Also contributing to the increase in legal and accounting expenses were general corporate matters and the growth of our portfolio.\n \u00b7 Common shares fully diluted. In accordance with GAAP, common shares used to calculate earnings per share are presented on a weighted average basis. Common shares on a fully diluted basis includes shares of common stock, OP units, redeemable OP units and unvested restricted stock outstanding at the end of the period on a share equivalent basis, because all shares are participating securities and thus share in the performance of the Company. The conversion of Preferred units is excluded from the calculation of common shares fully diluted as they are not participating securities, thus don't share in the performance of the Company and their impact on shares outstanding is uncertain. \nOverview\nFarmer Mac Facility\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $54.2 million primarily as a result of the following:\nImpairment of Real Estate Assets\nResults of Operations\nOther revenues totaled $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to no other revenues recognized in 2014. The other revenues recognized during 2015 were generated on interest and amortization of net loan fees, primarily from the FPI Loan Program, launched in August 2015.\n \u00b7 Receipt of $0.3 million of refund related to certain of our mortgage notes payable during 2015; and \nDemand\nMetLife Term Loans\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions. We have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in the notes to the historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this filing. We have set forth below those accounting policies that we believe require material subjective or complex judgments and have\nOther income, which is comprised primarily of income recognized on the sale of easements and rights-of-way, increased by $0.2 million, or 243.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nThe Operating Partnership's ability to borrow under the Farmer Mac Facility is subject to our ongoing compliance with a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants, as well as financial covenants, including: a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 60%; a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.5 to 1.00; and a minimum tangible net worth. On August 3, 2015, we amended the Bond Purchase Agreement in order to calculate the fixed charge coverage ratio using our Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Bond Purchase Agreement) rather than our EBITDA (as defined in the Bond Purchase Agreement). We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under the Farmer Mac Facility at December 31, 2016.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to acquire additional farmland and make other investments consistent with our investment strategy, make principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings, make distributions necessary to qualify for taxation as a REIT and fund our operations. Our sources of funds primarily will be cash on hand, operating cash flows and borrowings from prospective lenders.\n \u00b7 Borrowings from mortgage notes payable of $207.4 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, as compared to borrowings of $82.5 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2015; \nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased $56.5 million primarily as a result of the following:\nFollow-on Equity Offering\nAdvisor\u201d). On February 18, 2017, Farmland Partners Inc. (the Company\u201d) entered into a Termination Agreement (the Termination Agreement\u201d) with the Sub-Advisor pursuant to which the Company and Prudential agreed to terminate the Sub-Advisory Agreement and certain related property management agreements (together with the Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Prudential Agreements\u201d).\nThe costs of growing crop are accumulated until the time of harvest at the lower of cost or market value and are included in inventory in our consolidated financial statements. Costs are allocated to growing crops based on a percentage of the total costs of production and total operating costs that are attributable to the portion of the crops that remain in inventory at the end of the year. Growing crop consists primarily of land preparation, cultivation, irrigation and fertilization costs incurred by FPI Agribusiness. Growing crop inventory is charged to cost of products sold when the related crop is harvested and sold.\n \u00b7 Completing 26 acquisitions in 2015 for aggregate cash consideration of $109.3 million, as compared to $126.3 million in aggregate cash consideration for 29 acquisitions in 2014; \nThe Prudential loan requires the Company to maintain a loan to value no greater than 60%. The covenant commences from the anniversary of the loan, being December 21, 2017.\nThe value of a crop is affected by many factors that can differ on a yearly basis. Weather conditions and crop disease in major crop production regions worldwide creates a significant risk of price volatility, which may either increase or decrease the value of the crops that our tenants produce each year. Other material factors adding to the volatility of crop prices are changes in government regulations and policy, fluctuations in global prosperity, fluctuations in foreign trade and export markets, and eruptions of military conflicts or civil unrest. Prices for many primary crops, particularly corn, experienced meaningful declines in 2014 and 2015. We do not believe such declines represent a trend over the long term. Rather, we believe those declines represented a combination of correction to historical norms (adjusted for inflation) and high yields induced by farmer planting decisions and unusually favorable weather patterns. We expect that continued long-term growth trends in global population and GDP per capita will result in increased prices for primary crops over time. We expect pricing across specialty crops to generally remains firm relative to 2016 as U.S. and global consumer demand remains strong and supply is broadly balanced to demand. Although annual rental payments under the majority of our leases are not based expressly on the quality or profitability of our tenants' harvests, any of these factors could adversely affect our tenants' ability to meet their obligations to us and our ability to lease or re-lease properties on favorable terms.\nTotal consideration for acquisitions may include a combination of cash and equity securities.

Proceeds from the Prudential Note were used for the acquisition of additional land.\nIn connection with our initial public offering and the related formation transactions, on April 16, 2014, the Operating Partnership, as borrower, and First Midwest Bank, as lender, entered into the FMW Loan Agreement, which provided for loans in the initial aggregate principal amount of approximately $30,780,000. In April 2016 we fully repaid our debt under this loan.\nAs part of the AFCO Mergers, by virtue of AFCO OP becoming a subsidiary of the Company and the Operating Partnership, the Company and the Operating Partnership acquired four senior secured credit facilities in the aggregate amount of $90 million (the Existing Rutledge Loans\u201d) by and between AFCO OP and Rutledge Investment Company ( Rutledge\u201d). On February 3, 2017, AFCO OP entered into the Second Amendment to the Existing Rutledge Credit Facilities and the Company and the Operating Partnership each entered into guaranty agreements pursuant to which they will unconditionally guarantee the obligations of AFCO OP the Existing Rutledge Loan Agreements. In addition, on February 3, 2017, AFCO OP entered into a fifth loan agreement with Rutledge (the Fifth Rutledge Loan Agreement\u201d and, together with the Existing Rutledge Loan Agreements, the Rutledge Loan Agreements\u201d) with respect to a senior secured credit facility in the aggregate amount of $30 million.

This increase was primarily the result of the 55 acquisitions completed over the last two years. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the average annual cash rent for the entire portfolio increased to $209 per acre from $179 per acre in 2014.

Loan Agreement, dated as of December 5, 2013, with respect to a $25 million senior secured credit facility bearing interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.3%. The loan agreement requires AFCO OP to make quarterly interest payments on April 1, July 1, October 1 and January 1 of each calendar year. Additionally, the loan agreement requires AFCO OP to pay a quarterly non-usage fee equal to 0.25% of the committed loan amount minus the average outstanding principal balance of the loan amount over the prior three-month period. \nWe calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (loss) (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, plus real estate related depreciation, depletion and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. Management presents FFO as a supplemental performance measure because it believes that FFO is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance. Specifically, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating properties, which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.

As of December 31, 2016, we had $155.5 million outstanding under the Farmer Mac Facility.\nWe incur costs associated with running a public company, including, among others, costs associated with employing our personnel and compliance costs. We incur costs associated with due diligence and acquisitions, including, among others, travel expenses, consulting fees, and legal and accounting fees. We also incur costs associated with managing our farmland. The management of our farmland, generally, is not labor or capital intensive because farmland generally has minimal physical structures that require routine inspection and maintenance, and our leases, generally, are structured to require the tenant to pay many of the costs associated with the property. Furthermore, we believe that our platform is scalable, and we do not expect the expenses associated with managing our portfolio of farmland to increase significantly as the number of farm properties we own increases over time. Rather, we expect that as we continue to add additional farmland to our portfolio, we will be able to achieve economies of scale, which will enable us to reduce our operating costs per acre.\nProperties under Contract\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, we have completed acquisitions of the following properties in 2017 other than the properties acquired in the AFCO Mergers:\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $1.9 million, or 84.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in general and administrative expenses was largely the result of increased costs related to being a public company and our continued growth. We only incurred the costs of being a public company during the period following our IPO in 2014, while we incurred such costs for the entire year in 2015. During 2015, our public company costs increased $0.3 million due to increased investor relations, board, regulatory and compliance activity, stock-based compensation expense increased $0.2 million, conference attendance and travel expenses increased $0.3 million, consulting fees increased $0.2 million, and other corporate costs increased $0.02 million, due to increased rent and general office expenses related to increased headcount, as compared with the same period in 2014. Also contributing to the general and administrative increase during the year ended December 31, 2015 were employee compensation expenses, which increased $1.1 million as compared with the same period in 2014 as we did not have any employees prior to the IPO and have since increased our staffing to 13 employees and added a formal bonus program in the third quarter of 2014. These increases were offset by a decrease of $0.2 million in professional fees which were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014, on behalf of the Company by Pittman Hough Farms prior to the completion of the IPO.\nOther income decreased by $0.05 million, or 31.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. During both periods other income was recognized on the sale of easements and right-of-way.\nAFFO is calculated by adjusting FFO to exclude or include the income and expenses that we believe are not reflective of the sustainability of our ongoing operating performance, as further explained below:\nUpon consummation of the AFCO Mergers, by virtue of AFCO being merged with and into one of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries and AFCO OP becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, the Company acquired the Amended and Restated Sub-Advisory Agreement, dated as of October 23, 2015 (the Sub-Advisory Agreement\u201d), by and among AFCO, American Farmland Advisors, AFCO OP and Prudential Capital Mortgage Company (the Sub-\nOther revenue increased $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The income recognized in 2016 consisted of $0.8 million realized on crop sales from our TRS's farming operation, in addition to $0.2 million earned on interest and amortization of net loan fees, primarily from loans outstanding under the FPI Loan Program. The TRS was formed in March 2015 with the sales recognized in the first quarter of 2016 representing the first revenues generated by the entity. The FPI Loan Program was launched in August 2015 and has mortgage notes receivable totaling $2.8 million as of December 31, 2016.\nThe purchase price is allocated to in-place lease values and tenant relationships, if they are acquired, based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and our overall relationship with the tenant. The value of in-place lease intangibles and tenant relationships will be included as components of deferred leasing intangibles, and will be amortized over the remaining lease term (and expected renewal periods of the respective leases for tenant relationships) as amortization expense. If a tenant terminates its lease prior to its stated expiration, any unamortized amounts relating to that lease, including (i) above and below market leases, (ii) in-place lease values, and (iii) tenant relationships, would be recorded to revenue or expense as appropriate. We capitalize acquisition costs and due diligence costs if the asset is expected to qualify as an asset acquisition. If the asset acquisition is abandoned, the capitalized asset acquisition costs will be expensed to acquisition and due diligence costs in the period of abandonment. If we subsequently determine a previously expected asset acquisition is deemed a business combination, the previously capitalized costs are expensed.\nlandlord and the tenant significantly. This approach supports the tenants' desire to maintain access to their leased farms which are in short supply, a concept expanded upon below, by providing the landlord consistent rents. Crop price exposure is also limited because tenants also benefit from the fundamental revenue hedging that occurs when large crops mitigate the lower crop prices triggered by their large crop. Similarly, smaller crops have a tendency to increase the crop prices triggered and help increase revenue even when confronted by a smaller crop. Further risk mitigation is available to tenants, and indirectly to us, via crop insurance and hedging programs implemented by tenants. Our TRS takes advantage of this risk mitigation programs and strategies also.\n 3. Loan Agreement, dated as of August 18, 2015, with respect to a $25 million senior secured credit facility bearing interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.3%.

Our view is that rental rates for farmland are a function of farmland operators' view of the long-term profitability of farmland, and that many farm operators will compete for farmland even during periods of decreased profitability due to the scarcity of farmland available to rent. In particular, we believe that due to the relatively high fixed costs associated with farming operations (including equipment, labor and knowledge), many farm operators in some circumstances will rent additional acres of farmland when it becomes available in order to allocate their fixed costs over additional acres. Furthermore, because it is generally customary in the industry to provide the existing tenant with the opportunity to re-lease the land at the end of each lease term, we believe that many farm operators will rent additional land that becomes available in order to control the ability to farm that land in future periods. As a result, in our experience, many farm operators will aggressively pursue rental opportunities in their operable geographic area, even when the farmer anticipates lower current returns or short-term losses.\n \u00b7 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; \n \u00b7 An increase in cash paid for interest of $4.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015; and \n \u00b7 Investment of $5.7 million for real estate improvements during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $7.6 million in 2015 receipt of $0.05 million in principal from note receivable during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $0 million in 2015; and \nOn March 29, 2016, five wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership entered into the loan agreement (the First MetLife Loan Agreement\u201d and together with the Second MetLife Loan Agreement, the Fifth MetLife Loan Agreement and the Sixth MetLife Loan Agreement, the MetLife Loan Agreements\u201d), which provides a total of $127 million of term loans, comprised of (i) a $90 million term loan ( Term Loan 1\u201d), (ii) a $16.0 million term loan ( Term Loan 2\u201d) and (iii) a $21.0 million term loan ( Term Loan 3\u201d and, together with Term Loan 1 and Term Loan 2, the Initial MetLife Term Loans\u201d and, together with Term Loan 4 (as defined in the subsequent paragraph), the MetLife Term Loans).

Prior to this date the Company had not incurred any indirect offering costs. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance that, when considered with net income and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's understanding of our operating performance.\nLease Expirations\n \u00b7 Other contractual debt payments of $6.1 million made in 2015, compared to $1.0 million in contractual debt payments made during 2014; \nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) is a key financial measure used to evaluate our operating performance but should not be construed as an alternative to operating income, cash flows from operating activities or net income, in each case as determined in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is not a measure defined in accordance with GAAP. We believe that EBITDA is a standard performance measure commonly reported and widely used by analysts and investors in our industry. However, while EBITDA is a performance measure widely used across several industries, we do not believe that it correctly captures our business operating performance because it includes non-cash expenses and recurring adjustments that are necessary to better understand our business operating performance. Therefore, in addition to EBITDA, our management uses adjusted EBITDA ( Adjusted EBITDA\u201d), a non-GAAP measure.\n \u00b7 Increase of $0.9 million in employee compensation paid; \n \u00b7 Increase of $0.9 million in employee compensation paid; \nLeases in place in 2014 that provide for tenant payment of property taxes required the tenant to reimburse us for the tax amount we paid in 2015 for the 2014 taxable year.

Additionally, the loan agreement requires AFCO OP to pay a quarterly non-usage fee equal to 0.25% of the committed loan amount minus the average outstanding principal balance over the loan amount of the prior three-month period. \nOn February 3, 2017, AFCO OP, in its capacity as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and the Operating Partnership, entered into the Rutledge Amendment and the Company and the Operating Partnership each entered into separate guarantees (the Existing Rutledge Guarantees\u201d) pursuant to which they unconditionally guarantee the obligations of AFCO OP under the Existing Rutledge Loan Agreements. Pursuant to the Rutledge Amendment, among other things, the maturity dates for each of the Existing Rutledge Loan Agreements were extended to January 1, 2022 and the Company and the Operating Partnership were required to execute the Existing Loan Guarantees.\nAs of December 31, 2016 there was $6.6 million outstanding under the Prudential Note.\n\nContractual Obligations\nThe Farm Credit Mortgage Note contains a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants, as well as a covenant requiring us to maintain a debt service coverage ratio of 1.25 to 1.00 beginning on December 31, 2019.\nIn our primary row crop farmland, we see flat to modestly lower rent rates in connection with 2017 lease renewals. This is consistent with, on the one hand, headwinds in primary crop markets and, on the other, tenant demand for leasing high quality farmland. In 2016, we had a higher portion than in 2015 of our fixed cash leases providing for payment of 50% of a year's rent after harvest rather than substantially all of the lease paid prior to harvest, as compared to 2016. This structure better matches operator cash flows. Given per acre revenue on our primary crop farmland and crop insurance levels, we do not expect that this structure materially changes tenant credit risk. Due to the short term nature of most of our primary crop leases, we believe that a recovery of crop prices and farm profitability will be reflected relatively rapidly in our revenues via increases in rent rates. Across specialty crops, operator profitability generally remains healthy. Participating lease structures are common in many specialty crops and base lease rates are consistent with 2016.\nAcquisition and due diligence costs totaled $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $0.3 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2015.

All of our assets are held by, and our operations are primarily conducted through, the Operating Partnership and its wholly owned subsidiaries. As of the date of this Annual Report we own 83.8% of the OP units and none of the Preferred units. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Preferred units.\nHarvested crop inventory includes costs accumulated during both the growing and harvesting phases and is stated at the lower of those costs or the estimated net realizable value, which is the market price, based upon the nearest market in the geographic region, less any cost of disposition. Cost of disposition includes broker's commissions, freight and other marketing costs.\nSubstantially all of our farm leases are structured in such a way that we are responsible for major maintenance, certain insurance and taxes (which are sometimes reimbursed to us by our tenants), while our tenant is responsible for minor maintenance, water usage and all of the additional input costs related to farming operations on the property, such as seed, fertilizer, labor and fuel. We expect that substantially all of the leases for farmland we acquire in the future will continue to be structured in a manner consistent with substantially all of our existing leases. As the owner of the land, we generally only bear costs related to major capital improvements permanently attached to the property, such as irrigation systems, drainage tile, grain storage facilities, permanent plantings or other physical structures customary for farms. In cases where capital expenditures are necessary, we typically seek to offset, over a period of multiple years, the costs of such capital expenditures by increasing rental rates. We also incur the costs associated with maintaining liability and casualty insurance.\nSeasonality\nNM = Not Meaningful\nOn December 21, 2016, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership entered into a loan agreement with The Prudential Insurance Company of America ( Prudential\u201d) which provides for a loan of approximately $6.6 million to\nWe acquired the properties listed in the table below in connection with the AFCO Mergers which closed on February 2, 2017, and, as a result, our portfolio now consists of approximately 75% row crop farmland and 25% specialty crop farmland by value.\nIn connection with the Term Loan 6, on February 14, 2017, the Company and the Operating Partnership each entered into a separate guaranty (the Term Loan 6 Guaranties\u201d) whereby the Company and the Operating Partnership jointly and severally agreed to unconditionally guarantee all of the borrowers' obligations under the Sixth MetLife Loan Agreement.\n2016 Completed Acquisitions\nDuring 2017, $81.2 million of our borrowings will mature. Any cash that we use to satisfy our outstanding debt obligations will reduce the amounts available to acquire additional farms, which could adversely affect our growth prospects. The Company has $45.0 million and $3.1 million in capacity available under the Rutledge and Farm Credit of Central Florida facilities. Within twelve months of this Annual Report, $81.2 million of our borrowings will mature. We anticipate refinancing the debt due to mature in 2017 with the same or similar financial institutions and we are currently in discussions with existing lenders to do so. However, we can provide no assurances that we will be able to refinance the debt on similar terms or at all and thus alternative sources of capital may be necessary. To date, no such capital sources have been identified. As of December 31, 2016, we had $309.9 million of debt, which may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations, restrict our operations and our ability to grow our business and revenues and restrict our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. We plan to refinance these loans in 2017.\n (1) The consideration consisted entirely of OP units. \nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCrop Prices\nAs of December 31, 2016 there was $5.1 million outstanding under the Farm Credit Mortgage Note.

Direct origination costs are netted against loan origination fees and are amortized over the life of the note using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method, as an adjustment to interest income which is included in operating revenues as a component of other revenue in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nProperty operating expenses increased $0.9 million, or 343.4%, for the 2015 year, as compared to the prior year, of which $0.2 million is attributable to properties acquired during 2015. The remaining increase in property operating expenses is primarily related to increases in property insurance of $0.1 million, property taxes of $0.2 million, state franchise taxes of $0.1 million, and repairs of $0.1 million. Also increasing during the year were travel costs related to property visits on newly acquired properties of $0.1 million and $0.1 million of expenses for legal costs related to tenant issues.\nCash rental income for the same-property portfolio remained consistent at $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $2.6 million for 2014, as a result of average annual rent for the same-property portfolio decreasing to $357 per acre in 2015 from $360 per acre in 2014. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower crop share rent in 2015.\nWe believe quality farmland in the United States has a near-zero vacancy rate as a result of the supply and demand fundamentals.

Through December 31, 2016 the Company has generated $11.1 million in net cash proceeds under the ATM Program is intended to provide cost-effective financing alternatives in the capital markets and we intend to use the net proceeds from the ATM Program, if any, for future farmland acquisitions in accordance with our investment strategy and for general corporate purposes, which may also include originating loans to farmers under our loan program. We only intend to utilize the ATM Program if the market price of our common stock reaches levels which are deemed appropriate by our Board of Directors.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2015\nRecent Developments\n\n \u00b7 Aggregate dividend and distribution payments of $9.5 million to common stockholders and OP unitholders made in 2016, compared to aggregate dividends payments and net distributions to members of $5.9 million during 2015; and \nConsolidated Indebtedness\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, there is an aggregate amount of $75 million outstanding under Rutledge Loan Agreements.\nthe most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis, based on information that is then available to us, our experience and various matters that we believe are reasonable and appropriate for consideration under the circumstances.\n\n\nReal Estate Acquisitions\nIncome Taxes\n \u00b7 Completing 24 acquisitions in 2016 for aggregate cash consideration of $131.8 million, as compared to $109.3 million in aggregate cash consideration for 26 acquisitions in 2015; \nIn connection with the Bond Purchase Agreement, on March 1, 2015, we and the Operating Partnership also entered into a pledge and security agreement (as amended and restated, the Pledge Agreement\u201d) in favor of the Purchaser and Farmer Mac, pursuant to which we and the Operating Partnership agreed to pledge, as collateral for the Farmer Mac Facility, all of their respective right, title and interest in (i) mortgage loans with a value at least equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding bond held by the Purchaser and (ii) such additional collateral as necessary to have total collateral with a value at least equal to 110% of the outstanding notes held by the Purchaser. In addition, we agreed to guarantee the full performance of the Operating Partnership's duties and obligations under the Pledge Agreement.\n \u00b7 Investment of $7.6 million for real estate improvements during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $0.05 million in 2014; and \nIn addition, in August 2015, we announced the launch of the FPI Loan Program, an agricultural lending product aimed at farmers, as a complement to our primary business of acquiring and owning farmland and leasing it to farmers. Under the FPI Loan Program, we make loans to third-party farmers (both tenant and non-tenant) to provide partial financing for working capital requirements and operational farming activities, farming infrastructure projects, and for other farming and agricultural real estate related purposes.\nTenant reimbursements include reimbursements for real estate taxes that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of its lease. When leases require that the tenant reimburse the Company for property taxes paid by the Company, the reimbursement is reflected as tenant reimbursement revenue on the statements of operations, as earned, and the related property tax as property operating expense, as incurred. When a lease requires that the tenant pay the taxing authority directly, the Company does not incur this cost. If and when it becomes probable that a tenant will not be able to bear the property-related costs, the Company will accrue the estimated expense.\n \u00b7 Proceeds from an equity offering of $33.3 million during 2016, compared to total proceeds of $35.1 million from an equity offering during 2015; \nOn January 12, 2017, five wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, entered into a loan agreement (the Fifth MetLife Loan Agreement\u201d) with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ( Metlife\u201d) which provides for a loan of approximately $8.4 million to the Company with a maturity date of January 12, 2027 ( Term Loan 5\u201d). Interest on Term Loan 5 is payable in cash semi-annually and accrues at a 3.26% per annum fixed rate, this may be adjusted by MetLife on each of Janaury 12, 2020, January 12, 2023 and January 12, 2026 at the option of the Lender to a rate that is consistent with similar loans. Proceeds from Term Loan 5 were used to acquire additional properties and for general corporate purposes.\n \u00b7 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt; \nWe further adjust EBITDA for certain additional items such as stock based compensation, indirect offering costs, real estate acquisition related audit fees and real estate related acquisition and due diligence costs (for a full discussion of these adjustments see AFFO adjustments discussed above) that we consider necessary to understand our operating performance. As of September 30, 2015, we began excluding indirect offering costs from EBITDA as we believe it improves\n\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, the following farms are under contract:\nOn January 12, 2017, five wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, entered into the Fifth MetLife Loan Agreement with MetLife which provides for Term Loan 5, a loan of approximately $8.4 million to the Company with a maturity date of January 12, 2027. Interest on Term Loan 5 is payable in cash semi-annually and accrues at a 3.26 % per annum fixed, this may be adjusted by MetLife on each of Janaury 12, 2020, January 12, 2023 and January 12, 2026 at the option of the Lender to a rate that is consistent with similar loans. Proceeds from Term Loan 5 were used to acquire additional properties and for general corporate purposes.\n \u00b7 Indirect offering costs. Indirect offering costs are fees for services incurred by the Company to grow and maintain an active institutional investor presence. As we continue to acquire more farms, our ability to access capital through the equity markets will remain a critical component of our growth strategy. As of September 30, 2015, we began excluding indirect offering costs from AFFO as we believe it improves comparability of our results over each reporting period and of our company with other real estate operators. Prior to this date the company did not incur indirect offering costs. \nOn February 14, 2017, five wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, entered into a loan agreement (the Sixth MetLife Loan Agreement\u201d) with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ( Metlife\u201d) which provides for a loan of approximately $27.2 million to the Company with a maturity date of February 14, 2027 ( Term Loan 6\u201d). Interest on Term Loan 6 is payable in cash semi-annually and accrues at a 3.21% per annum fixed rate, this may be adjusted by MetLife on each of February 14, 2020, February 14, 2023 and February 14, 2026 at the option of the Lender to a rate that is consistent with similar loans. Proceeds from Term Loan 6 were used to acquire additional properties.\nAs described above, on February 2, 2017, we successfully completed the merger with AFCO, which resulted in us acquiring 21 permanent and row crop farms in 2017.\nOn August 31, 2016, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership entered into a loan agreement (the Farm Credit Mortgage Note\u201d) with Farm Credit of Central Florida ( Farm Credit\u201d) which provides for a loan of approximately $8.2 million to the Company with a maturity date of September 1, 2023. As of December 31, 2016 approximately $5.1 million had been drawn down under the Farm Credit Mortgage Note. Interest on the Farm Credit Mortgage Note is payable in cash quarterly and accrues at a floating rate that will be adjusted monthly to a rate per annum equal to the one-month LIBOR plus 2.6875% provided that the interest rate shall be subject to adjustment on the first day of September\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015 we had 23,043,318 and 16,155,971 shares of common stock and OP units outstanding on a fully diluted basis, respectively.\nexpected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. However, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not they will be realized on consideration of available evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies. There was $31,996 in taxable income from the TRS for the year ended December 31, 2016, and no taxable income at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay any outstanding borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, make distributions to our stockholders and to OP unitholders, and other general business needs.\nWe evaluate our tangible and identifiable intangible real estate assets for impairment indicators whenever events such as declines in a property's operating performance, deteriorating market conditions, or environmental or legal concerns bring recoverability of the carrying value of one or more assets into question. If such events are present, we project the total undiscounted cash flows of the asset, including proceeds from disposition, and compare it to the net book value of the asset. If this evaluation indicates that the carrying value may not be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded in earnings equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. There have been no impairments recognized on real estate assets in the accompanying financial statements.\nInterest Rates\nTotal rental income increased $16.1 million, or 119.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year. This increase was the result of the 50 acquisitions completed over the last two years and payments received in connection with the the early termination of certain leases in December 2016. As part of the termination, the Company recognized $3.7 million due to cash received under the contract greater than rental income previously recognized and $2.8 million in early termination fees. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the average annual cash rent for the entire portfolio increased to $224 per acre from $215 per acre in 2015.\nEach of the MetLife Loan Agreements includes certain customary events of default, including a cross-default provision related to other outstanding indebtedness of the borrowers, the Company and the Operating Partnership, the occurrence of which, after any applicable cure period, would permit MetLife, among other things, to accelerate payment of all amounts outstanding under the MetLife Term Loans and to exercise its remedies with respect to the pledged collateral, including foreclosure and sale of the Company's properties that secure the MetLife Term Loans. As of December 31, 2016 there was $142.7 million outstanding under the MetLife Term Loans and we were in compliance with all covenants under the MetLife Loan Agreements.\nHowever, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the operating performance of improvements on our properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. In addition, other equity REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or service indebtedness. FFO also should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP.\n \u00b7 Receipt of $0.3 million of refund related to certain of our mortgage notes payable during 2015 \nOn September 15, 2015, we filed a prospectus supplement under which we may sell shares of common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $25,000,000 through an at-the-market\u201d equity offering program (the ATM Program\u201d). The offering is made pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was declared effective by the SEC on May 14, 2015. As of December 31, 2016, 994,908 shares had been issued under the program for aggregate net proceeds of $11.1 million at a weighted average price per share of $11.17.\nUpon acquisition of real estate, we allocate the purchase price of the real estate based upon the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired, which historically have consisted of land, drainage improvements, irrigation improvements, groundwater, permanent plantings (bushes, shrubs, vines, perennials) and grain facilities and may also consist of intangible assets including in-place leases, above market and below market leases and tenant relationships. We allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the tangible assets of acquired real estate by valuing the land as if it were unimproved. We value improvements, including permanent plantings and grain facilities, at replacement cost as new adjusted for depreciation.\n\nAcquisitions Completed to date in 2017\nAs a REIT, for income tax purposes we are permitted to deduct dividends paid to our stockholders, thereby eliminating the U.S. federal taxation of income represented by such distributions at the Company level, provided certain requirements are met. REITs are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates.\nLeases in place as of December 31, 2016 had terms ranging from one to ten years. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had three leases with rent escalations. The majority of the Company's leases provide for a fixed annual or semi-annual cash rent payment. Tenant leases on acquired farms generally require the tenant to pay the Company rent for the entire initial year regardless of the date of acquisition, if the acquisition is closed prior to, or shortly after, planting of crops. If the acquisition is closed later in the year, the Company typically receives a partial rent payment or no rent payment at all.\n\n \u00b7 Borrowings from mortgage notes payable of $82.5 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to borrowings of $81.1 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2014; \nInterest expense increased by $3.2 million or 236.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of an increase in our average outstanding borrowings, which were $159.2 million\nReal Estate\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nDepreciation and depletion expense increased $0.6 million, or 171.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is the result of acquiring $7.5 million in depreciable assets in the last quarter of 2014, $7.0 million in depreciable assets throughout 2015 and investing $5.6 million in property improvements on acquired property during 2015.\n \u00b7 Stock based compensation. Stock based compensation is a non-cash expense and therefore, does not correlate with the ongoing operations. We believe that excluding these costs from AFFO improves comparability of our results over each reporting period and of our company with other real estate operators. \n \u00b7 Funding of $2.8 million in notes receivable, which was offset by $0.02 million of net origination fees received in 2015. \n\nCertain of the Company's leases provide for a rent payment determined as a percentage of the gross farm proceeds or a percentage of harvested crops. As of December 31, 2016, a majority of such leases provided for a rent payment determined as a percentage of the gross farm proceeds. Revenue under leases providing for a payment equal to a percentage of the harvested crop or a percentage of the gross farm proceeds are recorded at the guaranteed crop insurance minimums and recognized ratably over the lease term during the crop year. Upon notification from the grain facility that grain has been delivered in the Company's name, a future contract for delivery of the harvest has been finalized or when the tenant has notified the Company of the total amount of gross farm proceeds, revenue is recognized.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nBecause the leases for a many of the properties in our portfolio require significant payments in advance of the spring planting season, we receive a significant portion of our cash rental payments in the first calendar quarter of each year, although we recognize rental revenue from these leases on a pro rata basis over the non-cancellable term of the lease in accordance with GAAP.\nFor a summary of the new or revised accounting standards please refer to Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies\u201d within the notes to the combined consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nstraight-line basis and the cash rent received from tenants in accordance with the lease terms. Acquired below market leases are included in deferred revenue on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, which are amortized into rental income over the life of the respective leases, plus the terms of the below market renewal options, if any.\nOur exposure to short-term crop price declines is limited as most of our leases do not factor in per bushel prices and instead are set on a rental rate per acre basis. This approach is common throughout agriculture for several reasons. This approach recognizes that the value of leased land to a tenant is more closely linked to the total revenue produced on the property which is driven by crop yield and crop price. This approach simplifies the administrative requirements for the\n \u00b7 Other contractual debt payments of $84.8 million made in 2016, compared to $6.1 million in contractual debt payments made during 2015; \nbelieve that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs.\nConditions in Our Existing Markets\nGlobal supply of agricultural commodities is driven by two primary factors, the number of tillable acres available for crop production and the productivity of the acres being farmed. Although the amount of global cropland in use has gradually increased over time, growth has plateaued over the last 20 years. Cropland area continues to increase in developing countries, but after accounting for expected continuing cropland loss, the UN FAO projects only 171 million acres will be added from 2005-2007 to 2050, a 4.3% increase. In comparison, world population is expected to grow over the same period to 9.7 billion, a nearly 40% increase. While we expect growth in the global supply of arable land, we also expect that landowners will only put that land into production if increases in commodity prices and the value of farmland\nOn June 29, 2016, five wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership entered into a loan agreement (the Second MetLife Loan Agreement\u201d) with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ( MetLife\u201d), which provides for a loan of approximately $15.7 million (the Term Loan 4\u201d) to the Company with a maturity date of June 29, 2026. Interest on Term Loan 4 is payable in cash semi-annually and accrues at a floating rate that will be adjusted quarterly to a rate per annum equal to the greater of (a) the three-month LIBOR plus an initial floating rate spread of 1.750%, which may be adjusted by MetLife on each of September 29, December 29, March 29 and June 29 of each year to an interest rate equal to the greater of (a) the three month LIBOR plus the floating rate spread or (b) 2.00% per annum. The Loan initially bears interest at a rate of 2.39% per annum until September 29, 2016. On September 29, 2016 the rate increased to 2.59% per annum. Proceeds from Term Loan 4 were used to acquire additional properties and for general corporate purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $47.2 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to $23.5 million at December 31, 2015.\n\nWe are party to the Amended and Restated Bond Purchase Agreement, dated as of March 1, 2015 and amended on June 2, 2015 and August 3, 2015 (the Bond Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation ( Farmer Mac\u201d) and Farmer Mac Mortgage Securities Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Farmer Mac, as bond purchaser (the Purchaser\u201d), regarding a secured bond purchase facility (the Farmer Mac Facility\u201d) that has a maximum borrowing capacity of $165 million. Pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement, the Operating Partnership may, from time to time, issue one or more bonds to the Purchaser that will be secured by pools of mortgage loans, which will, in turn, be secured by first liens on agricultural real estate owned by us. The mortgage loans may have effective loan-to-value ratios of up to 60%, after giving effect to the overcollateralization obligations described below. Prepayment of each bond issuance is not permitted unless otherwise agreed upon by all parties to the Bond Purchase Agreement.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nAs of December 31, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\n \u00b7 Repurchase and retirement of $0.02 million of common stock during 2015. \nAs part of the AFCO Mergers, by virtue of AFCO OP becoming a subsidiary of the Company, the Company acquired the Existing Rutledge Loans, which are further described below:\n \u00b7 Distributions on Preferred units. Dividends on Preferred units, which are convertible into OP units on or after March 2, 2026, have a fixed and certain impact on our cash flow, thus they are subtracted from FFO. We believe this improves comparability of our company with other real estate operators. \nIn prior periods, our calculation of AFFO also adjusted FFO to reflect the difference between the pro rata contractual cash revenue for each crop year spread equally over the quarterly periods of ownership (without regard to the date of acquisition within the quarter) and the rent recognized on a straight-line basis in accordance with GAAP. In prior filings with the SEC, we referred to this adjustment as crop-year revenue adjustment.\u201d For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the crop-year revenue adjustment was $1.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively. In accordance with recently released interpretation from the SEC regarding the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, we no longer include the crop-year revenue adjustment in our calculation of AFFO.\n \u00b7 Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting the usefulness as a comparative measure. \nNet cash used for investing activities increased $17.7 million primarily as a result of the following:\nRental Revenues\n \u00b7 Debt prepayments of $0 on the First Midwest bank debt during 2016, as compared to $3.1 million in 2015; \nPrudential Loans\n \u00b7 Payments of $0.8 million in offering costs made during 2015, as compared to $2.3 million in payments during 2014; \nInterest expense increased by $5.3 million or 115.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. We recognized additional interest expense of approximately $2.4 million during 2016 related to interest and amortization of deferred loan fees associated with the $53.0 million Bridge Loan (as defined below under Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d), as all costs related to the Bridge Loan were both incurred and amortized during 2016. The increase in interest expense is due, in large part, to interest on the Bridge Loan of $2.3 million, which we do not expect to continue as we do not expect to enter into similar short term financing arrangements in the future. Interest expense increased approximately $3.1 million as the result of an increase in our outstanding borrowings during 2016, which were $309.9 million as of December 31, 2016 and $187.2 million for the comparative period in 2015. These increases were partially offset by the amortization of deferred financing fees and discounts/premiums on debt which increased $0.1 million during 2016.\nInterest on Term Loan 1 is payable in cash semi-annually and accrues at a floating rate that will be adjusted quarterly to a rate per annum equal to the greater of (a) the three-month LIBOR plus an initial floating rate spread of 1.750%, which may be adjusted by MetLife on each of March 29, 2019, March 29, 2022 and March 29, 2025 to an interest rate consistent with interest rates quoted by MetLife for substantially similar loans secured by real estate substantially similar to the Company's properties securing Term Loan 1 or (b) 2.000% per annum. Term Loan 1 bore interest at a rate of 2.40% per annum until September 29, 2016. On September 29, 2016 the rate increased to 2.59%. Subject to certain conditions, we may at any time during the term of Term Loan 1 elect to have all or any portion of the unpaid balance of Term Loan 1 bear interest at a fixed rate that is initially established by the lender in its sole discretion that may be adjusted from time to time to an interest rate consistent with interest rates quoted by MetLife for substantially similar loans secured by real estate substantially similar to the Company's properties securing Term Loan 1. On any floating rate adjustment date, we may prepay any portion of Term Loan 1 that is not subject to a fixed rate without penalty.\nduring the year December 31, 2015 and $44.4 million for 2014. Our weighted average cost of borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 2.80% and 2.76%, respectively. We also recognized additional interest expense of $0.2 million and $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to the amortization of deferred loan fees. These increases were partially offset by the amortization of a premium on our debt of $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe have or are currently negotiating leases on 50,721 acres and have 3,978 acres which have lease payments based solely on a percentage of farming revenues or crops, which are not included in the table above. We expect that rents for primary crop farmland will experience a modest decline in 2017, partially counterbalanced throughout our portfolio by rent increases deriving from farm improvements, such as irrigation, drainage and grain storage, that were or will be put in service for the 2017 crop year. We expect that rents for specialty crop farmland will be flat to modestly increasing.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nExpenses\n \u00b7 An increase in cash paid for interest of $2.9 million due to an increase in average outstanding indebtedness of approximately $115.5 million, year-to-year. \n \u00b7 Payments of $1.1 million in financing fees made during 2016, as compared to $0.2 million in payments during 2015; and ", "item_7_text": "General and administrative expenses increased $2.8 million, or 67.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased costs related to the continued growth of our portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2016, employee compensation expenses increased $2.3 million, as compared with the same period in 2015, due to an increase in the number of employees from 12 at the end of 2015 to 15 at the end of 2016. Included in compensation costs is $0.1 million for the new employee benefits program, which was not in place as of December 31, 2015. During 2016, our public company costs increased $0.3 million due to increased investor relations, regulatory and compliance activity, and conference attendance. We also had a $0.2 million increase in travel and office rent expense in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nThese acquisitions are expected to close in the first half of 2017, subject to the satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions. There can be no assurance that these conditions will be satisfied or that the pending acquisitions will be consummated on the terms described herein, or at all.\nThe Operating Partnership leases certain of its farms to the TRS, which is subject to federal and state income taxes. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities and their respective income tax basis and for operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards based on enacted income tax rates\n \u00b7 Receipt of $22.7 million in cash rents for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, as compared to receiving $16.4 million in cash rents in the same period of 2015; \n \u00b7 An increase in working capital of $3.3 million. \nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2014\nOur estimates of land value are made using a comparable sales analysis. Factors considered by us in our analysis of land value include soil types and water availability and the sales prices of comparable farms. Our estimates of groundwater value are made using historical information obtained regarding the applicable aquifer. Factors considered by us in our analysis of groundwater value are related to the location of the aquifer and whether or not the aquifer is a depletable resource or a replenishing resource. If the aquifer is a replenishing resource, no value is allocated to the groundwater. We include an estimate of property taxes in the purchase price allocation of acquisitions to account for the expected liability that was assumed.\nSupply\n \u00b7 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u00b7 Additional operating costs of $0.7 million directly related to being a public company for a full year in 2015; and \n \u00b7 Payments of $0.2 million in financing fees made during 2015, as compared to $0.4 million in payments during 2014; \n \u00b7 Receipt of $11.1 million under the ATM Program as compared to no receipts under the ATM program in the corresponding period ended December 31, 2015 \nOur ability to incur additional debt will depend on a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets, compliance with the covenants under our existing debt agreements, borrowing restrictions that may be imposed by lenders and the conditions of debt markets. Our ability to access the equity capital markets will depend on a number of factors as well, including general market conditions for REITs and market perceptions about our company.\nOn December 5, 2016, we completed an underwritten public offering of 3,100,000 shares of common stock at a price per share of $11.25 and generated aggregate net proceeds to the Company of approximately $32.9 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and commissions and expenses payable by the Company.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nOther inventory, such as fertilizer and pesticides, is valued at the lower of cost or market.\nThe principal factors affecting our operating results and the value of our farmland include global demand for food relative to the global supply of food, farmland fundamentals and economic conditions in the markets in which we own farmland, and our ability to increase or maintain rental revenues while controlling expenses. Although farmland prices may show a decline from time to time, we believe that any reduction in U.S. farmland values overall is likely to be short-lived as global demand for food and agricultural commodities typically exceeds global supply. In addition, although prices for many crops experienced significant declines in 2014 and 2015, we do not believe that such declines represent a trend that will continue over the long term. Rather, we believe that long-term growth trends in global population and GDP per capita will result in increased prices for primary crops over time.\nOur rental income for 2016 was impacted by the 26 acquisitions that took place in 2015, primarily in the fourth quarter, in addition to the 24 acquisitions that took place throughout 2016. To highlight the effect of changes due to acquisitions, we have separately discussed the rental income for the same-property portfolio, which includes only properties owned and operated for the entirety of both periods presented.\nIn connection with the Initial MetLife Term Loans, on March 29, 2016, the Company and the Operating Partnership each entered into a separate guaranty (the Initial MetLife Guaranties\u201d) whereby the Company and the Operating Partnership jointly and severally agreed to unconditionally guarantee all of the borrowers' obligations under the First MetLife Loan Agreement.\nIn connection with the AFCO Mergers, at the effective time of the Company Merger, each share of AFCO Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Company Merger (other than any shares of AFCO Common Stock owned by any wholly owned subsidiary of AFCO or by us or the Operating Partnership or any wholly owned subsidiary of us or the Operating Partnership), automatically converted into the right to receive, subject to certain adjustments, 0.7417 shares of our common stock. In addition, in connection with the Company Merger, each outstanding AFCO restricted stock unit that had become fully earned and vested in accordance with its terms, at the effective time of the Company Merger, was converted into the right to receive 0.7417 shares of our common stock. At the effective time of the Partnership Merger, each common unit of limited partnership interest in AFCO OP issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Partnership Merger, was converted automatically into the right to receive, subject to certain adjustments, 0.7417 OP units. We issued 14,763,604 shares of our common stock as consideration in the Company Merger and 17,373 shares of our common stock in respect of fully earned and vested AFCO restricted stock units. We issued 218,525 OP units in connection with the Partnership Merger.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nWe elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our short taxable year ended December 31, 2014.\nAll of the leases for the farmland in our portfolio have one- to five-year terms, with the exception of two that have ten-year terms, pursuant to which each tenant is responsible for substantially all of the operating expenses related to the property, including taxes, maintenance, water usage and insurance. As a result, we believe that the effect on us of inflationary increases in operating expenses may be offset in part by the operating expenses that are passed through to our tenants and by contractual rent increases because our leases will be renegotiated every one to five years. We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our historical financial position or results of operations.\nInterest on Term Loan 2 and Term Loan 3 is payable in cash semi-annually and accrues at an initial rate of 2.66% per annum, which may be adjusted by MetLife on each of March 29, 2019, March 29, 2022 and March 29, 2025 to an interest rate consistent with interest rates quoted by MetLife for substantially similar loans secured by real estate substantially similar to our properties securing Term Loan 2 and Term Loan 3.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of Net income (loss) to FFO, AFFO and net income available to common stockholders per share to AFFO per share, fully diluted, the most directly comparable GAAP equivalents, respectively, for the periods indicated below (unaudited):\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2015\nOur rental income for 2015 was impacted by the 29 acquisitions that took place in 2014, primarily in the fourth quarter, in addition to the 26 acquisitions that took place throughout 2015. To highlight the effect of changes due to acquisitions, we have separately discussed the rental income for the same-property portfolio, which includes only properties owned and operated for the entirety of both periods presented.\nMerger with American Farmland Company\ncause landowners to benefit economically from using the land for farming rather than alternative uses. We also believe that decreases in the amount of arable land in the United States and globally as a result of increasing urbanization will partially offset the impact of additional supply of farmland. The global supply of food is also impacted by the productivity per acre of tillable land. Historically, productivity gains (measured by average crop yields) have been driven by advances in seed technology, farm equipment, irrigation techniques and chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Furthermore, we expect the increasing shortage of water in many irrigated growing regions in the United States and other growing regions around the globe, often as a result of new water restrictions imposed by laws or regulations, to lead to decreased productivity growth on many acres and, in some cases, cause yields to decline on those acres.\nOther operating expenses totaled $0.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to no other operating expenses recognized in 2015, related to the cost of sales realized on crop sales from our TRS's farming operations.\nFirst Midwest Bank Indebtedness\nRevenue Recognition\n2016, and on the first day of each month thereafter. Proceeds from the Farm Credit Mortgage Note are to be used for the acquisition and development of additional farms.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $2.7 million, primarily as a result of the following:\n\nWe expect that future changes in interest rates will impact our overall operating performance by, among other things, increasing our borrowing costs. While we may seek to manage our exposure to future changes in rates through interest rate swap agreements or interest rate caps, portions of our overall outstanding debt will likely remain at floating rates. In addition, a sustained material increase in interest rates may cause farmland prices to decline if the rise in real interest rates (which is defined as nominal interest rates minus the inflation rate) is not accompanied by rises in the general levels of inflation. However, our business model anticipates that the value of our farmland will increase, as it has in the past, at a rate that is equal to or greater than the rate of inflation, which may in part offset the impact of rising interest rates on the value of our farmland, but there can be no guarantee that this appreciation will occur to the extent that we anticipate or at all.\nOverview and Background\nCertain of the Company's leases provide for minimum cash rent plus a bonus based on gross farm proceeds. Revenue under this type of lease is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term based on the minimum cash rent. Bonus rent is recognized upon notification from the tenant of the gross farm proceeds for the year.\nWe are an internally managed real estate company that owns and seeks to acquire high-quality farmland located in agricultural markets throughout North America. As of the date of this Annual Report, we own farms with an aggregate of approximately 142,223 acres in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. As of the date of this Annual Report, approximately 75% of the acres in our portfolio are used to grow primary crops, such as corn, soybeans, wheat, rice and cotton, and approximately 25% of the acres in our portfolio produce specialty crops, such as blueberries, vegetables, citrus, nuts and edible beans. We believe our portfolio gives investors exposure to the increasing global food demand trend in the face of growing scarcity of high quality farmland and will reflect the approximate breakdown of U.S. agricultural output between primary crops and animal protein (whose production relies principally on primary crops as feed), on one hand, and specialty crops, on the other.\nFarm leases are often short-term in nature. As of December 31, 2016 our portfolio had the following lease expirations as a percentage of approximate acres leased and annualized minimum cash rents:\nOur revenues are primarily generated from renting farmland to operators of farming businesses. Our leases have terms ranging from one to ten years. Although the majority of our leases do not provide the tenant with a contractual right to renew the lease upon its expiration, we believe it is customary to provide the existing tenant with the opportunity to renew the lease, subject to any increase in the rental rate that we may establish. If the tenant elects not to renew the lease at the end of the lease term, the land will be offered to a new tenant.\n (1) This acquisition closed on March 2, 2016. The purchase price of the property was comprised of (a) $50.0 million in cash, (b) an aggregate of 2,608,695 OP units valued at $11.50 per OP unit and (c) 117,000 Preferred units. See Note 9 - Stockholders' Equity and Non-controlling Interests\u201d. \nIn addition, on February 3, 2017, AFCO OP entered into the Fifth Rutledge Loan Agreement in respect to a senior secured credit facility in the aggregate amount of $30 million, with a maturity date of January 1, 2022 and an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.3%. The Fifth Rutledge Loan Agreement requires AFCO OP to make quarterly interest payments. Additionally, the Fifth Rutledge Loan Agreement requires AFCO OP to pay a quarterly non-usage fee equal to 0.25% of the committed loan amount minus the average outstanding principal balance of the loan amount during the prior three-month period. On February 2, 2017 the Company and the Operating Partnership each entered into separate guarantees (the Fifth Loan Guarantees\u201d and together with the Existing Loan Guarantees, the Guarantees\u201d) whereby they are required to unconditionally guarantee AFCO OP's obligations under the Fifth Rutledge Loan Agreement. Proceeds from Fifth Rutledge Loan will be used to acquire additional properties and for general corporate purposes.\nOur real estate consists of land, groundwater and improvements made to the land consisting of grain facilities, irrigation improvements, other assets and drainage improvements. We record real estate at cost and capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life or improve the efficiency of the asset. We expense costs of repairs and maintenance as such costs are incurred. We begin depreciating assets when the asset is ready for its intended use. We compute depreciation and depletion for assets classified as improvements using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 10-40 years for grain facilities, 2-40 years for irrigation improvements, 27-65 for drainage improvements, 3-50 years for groundwater, 13-23 years for permanent plantings, and 5-40 years for other assets acquired. We periodically evaluate the estimated useful lives for groundwater based on current state water regulations and depletion levels of the aquifers.\nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results of operations and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA only as a supplemental measure of our performance.\nIn connection with the Term Loan 4, on June 29, 2016, the Company and the Operating Partnership each entered into a separate guaranty (the Term Loan 4 Guaranties\u201d) whereby the Company and the Operating Partnership jointly and severally agreed to unconditionally guarantee all of the borrowers' obligations under the Second MetLife Loan Agreement.\nWe expect that global demand for food, driven primarily by significant increases in the global population and GDP per capita, will continue to be the key driver of farmland values. We further expect that global demand for most crops will continue to grow to keep pace with global population growth, which we anticipate will lead to either higher prices and/or higher yields and, therefore, higher rental rates on our farmland, as well as sustained growth in farmland values over the long-term. We also believe that growth in global GDP per capita, particularly in developing nations, will contribute significantly to increasing demand for primary crops. As global GDP per capita increases, the composition of daily caloric intake is expected to shift away from the direct consumption of primary crops toward animal-based proteins, which is expected to result in increased demand for primary crops as feed for livestock. According to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization ( UN FAO\u201d), these factors are expected to require more than one billion additional tons of global annual grain production by 2050, a 45.5% increase from 2005-2007 levels and more than two times the 475 million tons of grain produced in the United States in 2014. Furthermore, we believe that, as GDP per capita grows, a significant portion of additional household income is allocated to food and that once individuals increase consumption of, and spending on, higher quality food, they will strongly resist returning to their former dietary habits, resulting in greater inelasticity in the demand for food. As a result, we believe that, as global demand for food increases, rental rates on our farmland and the value of our farmland will increase over the long-term. Global demand for corn and soybeans as inputs in the production of biofuels such as ethanol and soy diesel also could impact the prices of corn and soybeans, which, in the long-term, could impact our rental revenues and our results of operations. However, the success of our business strategy is not dependent on growth in demand for biofuels and we do not believe that demand for corn and soybeans as inputs in the production of biofuels will materially impact our results of operations or the value of our farmland, primarily because we believe that growth in global population and GDP per capita will be more significant drivers of global demand for primary crops over the long-term.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $23.5 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to $33.7 million at December 31, 2014.\n \u00b7 Aggregate dividend and distribution payments of $5.9 million to common stockholders and OP unitholders made in 2015, compared to aggregate dividends payments and net distributions to members of $2.7 million during 2014; and \nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $5.9 million, primarily as a result of the following:\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of AFFO share information to basic weighted average common shares outstanding, the most directly comparable GAAP equivalent, for the periods indicated below (unaudited):\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2016:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company entered into two separate sale and partial leaseback transactions in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia in December 2014 and June 2015. These leases were due to expire on December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2019. The tenant and the Company agreed to terminate the leases effective as of December 31, 2016. As part of the termination settlement, the tenant agreed to pay an additional rent amount related to 2016 of $2.8 million. In addition, the Company fully recognized as 2016 revenue certain rent payments, totaling $3.7 million, of which the majority was made by the tenant in June 2015, that the Company had not yet recognized under its revenue recognition policy.\nDepreciation and depletion expense increased $0.7 million, or 74.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is the result of acquiring or constructing $14 million in depreciable assets throughout 2016.\nWe do not, however, believe that FFO is the only measure of the sustainability of our operating performance. Changes in GAAP accounting and reporting rules that were put in effect after the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO in 1999 result in the inclusion of a number of items in FFO that do not correlate with the sustainability of our operating performance. Therefore, in addition to FFO, we present AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted, both of which are non-GAAP measures. Management considers AFFO a useful supplemental performance metric for investors as it is more indicative of the Company's operational performance than FFO. AFFO is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period, and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance. Even AFFO, however, does not properly capture the timing of cash receipts, especially in connection with full-year rent payments under lease agreements entered into in connection with newly acquired farms. Management considers AFFO per share, fully diluted to be a supplemental metric to GAAP earnings per share. AFFO per share, fully diluted provides additional insight into how our operating performance could be allocated to potential shares outstanding at a specific point in time. Management believes that AFFO is a widely recognized measure of the operations of REITs, and presenting AFFO will enable investors to assess our performance in comparison to other REITs. However, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted and, accordingly, our AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted may not always be comparable to AFFO and AFFO per share amounts calculated by other REITs. AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or earnings per share (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or as an alternative to net income (loss) earnings per share (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor are they indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nSubject to certain conditions, amounts outstanding under Term Loan 2 and Term Loan 3, as well as any amounts outstanding under Term Loan 1 that are subject to a fixed interest rate, may be prepaid without penalty up to 20% of the\nNew or Revised Accounting Standards\nWhen we acquire a property in a business combination, we evaluate such acquisition for any related deferred tax assets or liabilities and determine if a deferred tax asset or liability should be recorded in conjunction with the purchase price allocation. If a built-in gain is acquired, we evaluate the required holding period (generally 5-10 years) and determine if we have the ability and intent to hold the underlying assets for the necessary holding period. If we have the ability to hold the underlying assets for the required holding period, no deferred tax liability will be recorded with respect to the built-in gain.\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to acquire additional farmland, make other investments and certain long-term capital expenditures, make principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings, and make distributions necessary to qualify for taxation as a REIT. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, including future equity issuances (including issuances of OP units), net cash provided by operations, long-term mortgage indebtedness and other secured and unsecured borrowings.\nWe account for all acquisitions in accordance with the business combinations standard. When we acquire farmland that was previously operated as a rental property, we evaluate whether a lease is in place or a crop is being produced at the time of closing of the acquisition. If a lease is in place or a crop is being produced at the time of acquisition, we account for the transaction as a business combination and charge the costs associated with the acquisition to acquisition and due diligence costs on the Consolidated Statement of Operations as incurred. Otherwise, acquisitions with no lease in place or crops being produced at the time of acquisition are accounted for as asset acquisitions with the transaction costs incurred capitalized to the assets acquired. When we acquire farmland in a sale-lease back transaction with newly originated leases entered into with the seller, we account for the transaction as an asset acquisition and capitalize the transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition.\nthe Company with a maturity date of July 1, 2019 (the Prudential Note\u201d). Interest on the Prudential Note is payable in cash semi-annually and accrues at a fixed rate of 3.20% per annum. Proceeds from the Prudential Note were used to acquire additional properties and for general corporate purposes.\nThe following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nProperty operating expenses increased $1.3 million or 115.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, of which $0.8 million is attributable to an increase in property taxes and $0.2 million to an increase in property insurance primarily as a result of property acquisitions. The increase also included a $0.3 million increase in a variety of other property operating costs such as repairs and maintenance, state and franchise taxes and other miscellaneous items.\n \u00b7 Funding of $2.8 million in notes receivable, which was offset by $0.02 million of net origination fees received for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. \nFarm Credit of Central Florida Mortgage Note\nWe perform an annual review for any uncertain tax positions and, if necessary, will record future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements. An uncertain tax position is defined as a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that is not based on clear and unambiguous tax law and which is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods. At December 31, 2016, we did not identify any uncertain tax positions.\nWhen above or below market leases are acquired, we value the intangible assets based on the present value of the difference between prevailing market rates and the in-place rates measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases that are considered bargain renewal options. The above market lease values will be amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining term of the respective leases. The fair value of acquired below market leases, included in deferred revenue on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, is amortized as an increase of rental income on a straight-line basis over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases, plus the terms of any below market fixed rate renewal options that are considered bargain renewal options of the respective leases.\nThe leases for the majority of the properties in our portfolio provide that tenants must pay us at least 50% (and often 100%) of the annual rent in advance of each spring planting season. As a result, we collect a significant portion of total annual rents in the first calendar quarter of each year. We believe our use of leases pursuant to which at least 50% of the annual rent is payable in advance of each spring planting season mitigates the tenant credit risk associated with the variability of farming operations that could be adversely impacted by poor crop yields, weather conditions, mismanagement, undercapitalization or other factors affecting our tenants. Prior to acquiring farmland property, we take into consideration the competitiveness of the local farm-operator tenant environment in order to enhance our ability to quickly replace a tenant that is unwilling to renew a lease or is unable to pay a rent payment when it is due. Some of our leases provide for a reimbursement of the property taxes we pay. We expect that, going forward, a progressively smaller percentage of our leases will provide for such a reimbursement.\nLegal and accounting expenses increased $0.4 million, or 32.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015. Costs associated with general corporate matters and the growth of our portfolio, including costs related to the AFCO Mergers, contributed to the increase in legal and accounting expenses.\n \u00b7 Real estate related acquisition and due diligence costs. Acquisition (including audit fees associated with these acquisitions) and due diligence costs are incurred for investment purposes and therefore, do not correlate with the ongoing operations of our portfolio. We believe that excluding these costs from AFFO provides useful supplemental information reflective of the realized economic impact of our leases, which is useful in assessing the sustainability of our operating performance. Acquisition and due diligence costs totaled $2.5 million, $0.3 million and $0.2 million for the years December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Real estate related acquisition and due diligence costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $2.3 million in interest and loan fees associated with the short-term Bridge Loan and the Forsythe acquisition and as the interest and fees are a non-recurring item they have been excluded from the AFFO calculation. Included in the $2.3 million of interest and loan fees is only a portion of the interest, approximately $2.1 million, or 4% of the Bridge Loan's principal amount, which was considered additional interest paid as discount on issuance. A portion of the audit fees we incur are directly related to acquisitions, which varies with the number and complexity of the acquisitions we evaluate and complete in a given period. As such, these costs do not correlate with the ongoing operations of our portfolio. Total acquisition related audit fees excluded from AFFO totaled $0.3 million, $0.2 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We believe that excluding these costs from AFFO provides useful supplemental information reflective of the realized economic impact of our current acquisition strategy, which is useful in assessing the sustainability of our operating performance. These \nAs of December 31, 2016, we owned 75.1% of the OP units in the Operating Partnership.\n \u00b7 Increase of $0.6 million in property taxes; \nIn connection with the Term Loan 5, on January 12, 2017, the Company and the Operating Partnership each entered the Term Loan 5 Guaranties whereby the Company and the Operating Partnership jointly and severally agreed to unconditionally guarantee all of the borrowers' obligations under the Fifth MetLife Loan Agreement.\nWhen a sale occurs, we recognize the associated gain when all consideration has been transferred, the sale has closed, and there is no material continuing involvement. If a sale is expected to generate a loss, we first assess it through the impairment evaluation process. See \u2018\u2018-Impairment of Real Estate Assets'' below.\nEach of the MetLife Loan Agreements contains a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants, including the requirement to maintain loan to value ratio of no greater than 60%. The MetLife Guaranties also contain a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants.\nIn connection with the Term Loan 6, on February 14, 2017, the Company and the Operating Partnership each entered into a separate guaranty (the Term Loan 6 Guaranties\u201d) whereby the Company and the Operating Partnership jointly and severally agreed to unconditionally guarantee all of the borrowers' obligations under the Sixth MetLife Loan Agreement.\nLegal and accounting expenses increased $0.5 million, or 77.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of being a public company for a full year with the Company going public in April 2014. Also contributing to the increase in legal and accounting expenses were general corporate matters and the growth of our portfolio.\n \u00b7 Common shares fully diluted. In accordance with GAAP, common shares used to calculate earnings per share are presented on a weighted average basis. Common shares on a fully diluted basis includes shares of common stock, OP units, redeemable OP units and unvested restricted stock outstanding at the end of the period on a share equivalent basis, because all shares are participating securities and thus share in the performance of the Company. The conversion of Preferred units is excluded from the calculation of common shares fully diluted as they are not participating securities, thus don't share in the performance of the Company and their impact on shares outstanding is uncertain. \nOverview\nFarmer Mac Facility\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $54.2 million primarily as a result of the following:\nImpairment of Real Estate Assets\nResults of Operations\nOther revenues totaled $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to no other revenues recognized in 2014. The other revenues recognized during 2015 were generated on interest and amortization of net loan fees, primarily from the FPI Loan Program, launched in August 2015.\n \u00b7 Receipt of $0.3 million of refund related to certain of our mortgage notes payable during 2015; and \nDemand\nMetLife Term Loans\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions. We have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in the notes to the historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this filing. We have set forth below those accounting policies that we believe require material subjective or complex judgments and have\nOther income, which is comprised primarily of income recognized on the sale of easements and rights-of-way, increased by $0.2 million, or 243.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nThe Operating Partnership's ability to borrow under the Farmer Mac Facility is subject to our ongoing compliance with a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants, as well as financial covenants, including: a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 60%; a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.5 to 1.00; and a minimum tangible net worth. On August 3, 2015, we amended the Bond Purchase Agreement in order to calculate the fixed charge coverage ratio using our Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Bond Purchase Agreement) rather than our EBITDA (as defined in the Bond Purchase Agreement). We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under the Farmer Mac Facility at December 31, 2016.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to acquire additional farmland and make other investments consistent with our investment strategy, make principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings, make distributions necessary to qualify for taxation as a REIT and fund our operations. Our sources of funds primarily will be cash on hand, operating cash flows and borrowings from prospective lenders.\n \u00b7 Borrowings from mortgage notes payable of $207.4 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, as compared to borrowings of $82.5 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2015; \nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased $56.5 million primarily as a result of the following:\nFollow-on Equity Offering\nAdvisor\u201d). On February 18, 2017, Farmland Partners Inc. (the Company\u201d) entered into a Termination Agreement (the Termination Agreement\u201d) with the Sub-Advisor pursuant to which the Company and Prudential agreed to terminate the Sub-Advisory Agreement and certain related property management agreements (together with the Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Prudential Agreements\u201d).\nThe costs of growing crop are accumulated until the time of harvest at the lower of cost or market value and are included in inventory in our consolidated financial statements. Costs are allocated to growing crops based on a percentage of the total costs of production and total operating costs that are attributable to the portion of the crops that remain in inventory at the end of the year. Growing crop consists primarily of land preparation, cultivation, irrigation and fertilization costs incurred by FPI Agribusiness. Growing crop inventory is charged to cost of products sold when the related crop is harvested and sold.\n \u00b7 Completing 26 acquisitions in 2015 for aggregate cash consideration of $109.3 million, as compared to $126.3 million in aggregate cash consideration for 29 acquisitions in 2014; \nThe Prudential loan requires the Company to maintain a loan to value no greater than 60%. The covenant commences from the anniversary of the loan, being December 21, 2017.\nThe value of a crop is affected by many factors that can differ on a yearly basis. Weather conditions and crop disease in major crop production regions worldwide creates a significant risk of price volatility, which may either increase or decrease the value of the crops that our tenants produce each year. Other material factors adding to the volatility of crop prices are changes in government regulations and policy, fluctuations in global prosperity, fluctuations in foreign trade and export markets, and eruptions of military conflicts or civil unrest. Prices for many primary crops, particularly corn, experienced meaningful declines in 2014 and 2015. We do not believe such declines represent a trend over the long term. Rather, we believe those declines represented a combination of correction to historical norms (adjusted for inflation) and high yields induced by farmer planting decisions and unusually favorable weather patterns. We expect that continued long-term growth trends in global population and GDP per capita will result in increased prices for primary crops over time. We expect pricing across specialty crops to generally remains firm relative to 2016 as U.S. and global consumer demand remains strong and supply is broadly balanced to demand. Although annual rental payments under the majority of our leases are not based expressly on the quality or profitability of our tenants' harvests, any of these factors could adversely affect our tenants' ability to meet their obligations to us and our ability to lease or re-lease properties on favorable terms.\nTotal consideration for acquisitions may include a combination of cash and equity securities. When equity securities are issued, we determine the fair value of the equity securities issued based on the number of shares of common stock and\nTermination of Leases\nFunds from Operations ( FFO\u201d) and Adjusted Funds from Operations ( AFFO\u201d)\nOur portfolio spans numerous farmland markets and crop types, which provides us broad diversification across conditions in these markets. Across all regions, farmland acquisitions continue to be dominated by buyers who are existing farm owners and operators; institutional and investor acquirors remain a small fraction of the industry. We generally see firm demand for high quality properties across all regions and crop types.\nOn December 21, 2016, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership entered into a loan agreement with Prudential which provides for the Prudential Note, a loan of approximately $6.6 million to the Company with a maturity date of July 1, 2019. Interest on the Prudential Note is payable in cash semi-annually and accrues at a fixed rate of 3.20% per annum. Proceeds from the Prudential Note were used for the acquisition of additional land.\nIn connection with our initial public offering and the related formation transactions, on April 16, 2014, the Operating Partnership, as borrower, and First Midwest Bank, as lender, entered into the FMW Loan Agreement, which provided for loans in the initial aggregate principal amount of approximately $30,780,000. In April 2016 we fully repaid our debt under this loan.\nAs part of the AFCO Mergers, by virtue of AFCO OP becoming a subsidiary of the Company and the Operating Partnership, the Company and the Operating Partnership acquired four senior secured credit facilities in the aggregate amount of $90 million (the Existing Rutledge Loans\u201d) by and between AFCO OP and Rutledge Investment Company ( Rutledge\u201d). On February 3, 2017, AFCO OP entered into the Second Amendment to the Existing Rutledge Credit Facilities and the Company and the Operating Partnership each entered into guaranty agreements pursuant to which they will unconditionally guarantee the obligations of AFCO OP the Existing Rutledge Loan Agreements. In addition, on February 3, 2017, AFCO OP entered into a fifth loan agreement with Rutledge (the Fifth Rutledge Loan Agreement\u201d and, together with the Existing Rutledge Loan Agreements, the Rutledge Loan Agreements\u201d) with respect to a senior secured credit facility in the aggregate amount of $30 million.

This increase was primarily the result of the 55 acquisitions completed over the last two years. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the average annual cash rent for the entire portfolio increased to $209 per acre from $179 per acre in 2014. This increase was the result of diversification of our portfolio to new markets.\nTotal rental income under leases for the same-property portfolio increased to $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as a result of average annual rent for the same-property portfolio increasing year over year to $209 per acre in 2016 from $203 in 2015.\n 1. Loan Agreement, dated as of December 5, 2013, with respect to a $25 million senior secured credit facility bearing interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.3%. The loan agreement requires AFCO OP to make quarterly interest payments on April 1, July 1, October 1 and January 1 of each calendar year. Additionally, the loan agreement requires AFCO OP to pay a quarterly non-usage fee equal to 0.25% of the committed loan amount minus the average outstanding principal balance of the loan amount over the prior three-month period. \nWe calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (loss) (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, plus real estate related depreciation, depletion and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. Management presents FFO as a supplemental performance measure because it believes that FFO is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance. Specifically, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating properties, which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also\nFinancing Activity\nLeases in place in 2015 that provide for tenant payment of property taxes required the tenant to reimburse us for the tax amount we paid in 2016 for the 2015 taxable year.

As of December 31, 2016, we had $155.5 million outstanding under the Farmer Mac Facility.\nWe incur costs associated with running a public company, including, among others, costs associated with employing our personnel and compliance costs. We incur costs associated with due diligence and acquisitions, including, among others, travel expenses, consulting fees, and legal and accounting fees. We also incur costs associated with managing our farmland. The management of our farmland, generally, is not labor or capital intensive because farmland generally has minimal physical structures that require routine inspection and maintenance, and our leases, generally, are structured to require the tenant to pay many of the costs associated with the property. Furthermore, we believe that our platform is scalable, and we do not expect the expenses associated with managing our portfolio of farmland to increase significantly as the number of farm properties we own increases over time. Rather, we expect that as we continue to add additional farmland to our portfolio, we will be able to achieve economies of scale, which will enable us to reduce our operating costs per acre.\nProperties under Contract\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, we have completed acquisitions of the following properties in 2017 other than the properties acquired in the AFCO Mergers:\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $1.9 million, or 84.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in general and administrative expenses was largely the result of increased costs related to being a public company and our continued growth. We only incurred the costs of being a public company during the period following our IPO in 2014, while we incurred such costs for the entire year in 2015. During 2015, our public company costs increased $0.3 million due to increased investor relations, board, regulatory and compliance activity, stock-based compensation expense increased $0.2 million, conference attendance and travel expenses increased $0.3 million, consulting fees increased $0.2 million, and other corporate costs increased $0.02 million, due to increased rent and general office expenses related to increased headcount, as compared with the same period in 2014. Also contributing to the general and administrative increase during the year ended December 31, 2015 were employee compensation expenses, which increased $1.1 million as compared with the same period in 2014 as we did not have any employees prior to the IPO and have since increased our staffing to 13 employees and added a formal bonus program in the third quarter of 2014. These increases were offset by a decrease of $0.2 million in professional fees which were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014, on behalf of the Company by Pittman Hough Farms prior to the completion of the IPO.\nOther income decreased by $0.05 million, or 31.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. During both periods other income was recognized on the sale of easements and right-of-way.\nAFFO is calculated by adjusting FFO to exclude or include the income and expenses that we believe are not reflective of the sustainability of our ongoing operating performance, as further explained below:\nUpon consummation of the AFCO Mergers, by virtue of AFCO being merged with and into one of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries and AFCO OP becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, the Company acquired the Amended and Restated Sub-Advisory Agreement, dated as of October 23, 2015 (the Sub-Advisory Agreement\u201d), by and among AFCO, American Farmland Advisors, AFCO OP and Prudential Capital Mortgage Company (the Sub-\nOther revenue increased $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The income recognized in 2016 consisted of $0.8 million realized on crop sales from our TRS's farming operation, in addition to $0.2 million earned on interest and amortization of net loan fees, primarily from loans outstanding under the FPI Loan Program. The TRS was formed in March 2015 with the sales recognized in the first quarter of 2016 representing the first revenues generated by the entity. The FPI Loan Program was launched in August 2015 and has mortgage notes receivable totaling $2.8 million as of December 31, 2016.\nThe purchase price is allocated to in-place lease values and tenant relationships, if they are acquired, based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and our overall relationship with the tenant. The value of in-place lease intangibles and tenant relationships will be included as components of deferred leasing intangibles, and will be amortized over the remaining lease term (and expected renewal periods of the respective leases for tenant relationships) as amortization expense. If a tenant terminates its lease prior to its stated expiration, any unamortized amounts relating to that lease, including (i) above and below market leases, (ii) in-place lease values, and (iii) tenant relationships, would be recorded to revenue or expense as appropriate. We capitalize acquisition costs and due diligence costs if the asset is expected to qualify as an asset acquisition. If the asset acquisition is abandoned, the capitalized asset acquisition costs will be expensed to acquisition and due diligence costs in the period of abandonment. If we subsequently determine a previously expected asset acquisition is deemed a business combination, the previously capitalized costs are expensed.\nlandlord and the tenant significantly. This approach supports the tenants' desire to maintain access to their leased farms which are in short supply, a concept expanded upon below, by providing the landlord consistent rents. Crop price exposure is also limited because tenants also benefit from the fundamental revenue hedging that occurs when large crops mitigate the lower crop prices triggered by their large crop. Similarly, smaller crops have a tendency to increase the crop prices triggered and help increase revenue even when confronted by a smaller crop. Further risk mitigation is available to tenants, and indirectly to us, via crop insurance and hedging programs implemented by tenants. Our TRS takes advantage of this risk mitigation programs and strategies also.\n 3. Loan Agreement, dated as of August 18, 2015, with respect to a $25 million senior secured credit facility bearing interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.3%. The loan agreement requires AFCO OP to make quarterly interest payments on April 1, July 1, October 1 and January 1 of each calendar year. Additionally, the loan agreement requires AFCO OP to pay a quarterly non-usage fee equal to 0.25% of the committed loan amount minus the average outstanding principal balance of the loan amount over the prior three-month period. \nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2014\n \u00b7 Proceeds from an equity offering of $35.1 million during 2015, compared to total proceeds of $93.6 million from an initial public offering and subsequent equity offering during 2014; \nIn connection with the Term Loan 5, on January 12, 2017, the Company and the Operating Partnership each entered into a separate guaranty (the Term Loan 5 Guaranties\u201d) whereby the Company and the Operating Partnership jointly and severally agreed to unconditionally guarantee all of the borrowers' obligations under the Fifth MetLife Loan Agreement.\nWith regard to leasing dynamics, we believe quality farmland in the United States has a near-zero vacancy rate as a result of the supply and demand fundamentals discussed above. Our view is that rental rates for farmland are a function of farmland operators' view of the long-term profitability of farmland, and that many farm operators will compete for farmland even during periods of decreased profitability due to the scarcity of farmland available to rent. In particular, we believe that due to the relatively high fixed costs associated with farming operations (including equipment, labor and knowledge), many farm operators in some circumstances will rent additional acres of farmland when it becomes available in order to allocate their fixed costs over additional acres. Furthermore, because it is generally customary in the industry to provide the existing tenant with the opportunity to re-lease the land at the end of each lease term, we believe that many farm operators will rent additional land that becomes available in order to control the ability to farm that land in future periods. As a result, in our experience, many farm operators will aggressively pursue rental opportunities in their operable geographic area, even when the farmer anticipates lower current returns or short-term losses.\n \u00b7 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; \n \u00b7 An increase in cash paid for interest of $4.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015; and \n \u00b7 Investment of $5.7 million for real estate improvements during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $7.6 million in 2015 receipt of $0.05 million in principal from note receivable during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $0 million in 2015; and \nOn March 29, 2016, five wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership entered into the loan agreement (the First MetLife Loan Agreement\u201d and together with the Second MetLife Loan Agreement, the Fifth MetLife Loan Agreement and the Sixth MetLife Loan Agreement, the MetLife Loan Agreements\u201d), which provides a total of $127 million of term loans, comprised of (i) a $90 million term loan ( Term Loan 1\u201d), (ii) a $16.0 million term loan ( Term Loan 2\u201d) and (iii) a $21.0 million term loan ( Term Loan 3\u201d and, together with Term Loan 1 and Term Loan 2, the Initial MetLife Term Loans\u201d and, together with Term Loan 4 (as defined in the subsequent paragraph), the MetLife Term Loans). The proceeds of the MetLife Term Loans were used to repay existing debt (including amounts outstanding under the existing Bridge Loan agreement) to acquire additional properties and for general corporate purposes.

Prior to this date the Company had not incurred any indirect offering costs. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance that, when considered with net income and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's understanding of our operating performance.\nLease Expirations\n \u00b7 Other contractual debt payments of $6.1 million made in 2015, compared to $1.0 million in contractual debt payments made during 2014; \nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) is a key financial measure used to evaluate our operating performance but should not be construed as an alternative to operating income, cash flows from operating activities or net income, in each case as determined in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is not a measure defined in accordance with GAAP. We believe that EBITDA is a standard performance measure commonly reported and widely used by analysts and investors in our industry. However, while EBITDA is a performance measure widely used across several industries, we do not believe that it correctly captures our business operating performance because it includes non-cash expenses and recurring adjustments that are necessary to better understand our business operating performance. Therefore, in addition to EBITDA, our management uses adjusted EBITDA ( Adjusted EBITDA\u201d), a non-GAAP measure.\n \u00b7 Increase of $0.9 million in employee compensation paid; \n \u00b7 Increase of $0.9 million in employee compensation paid; \nLeases in place in 2014 that provide for tenant payment of property taxes required the tenant to reimburse us for the tax amount we paid in 2015 for the 2014 taxable year.

Loan Agreement, dated as of December 22, 2015, with respect to a $15 million senior secured credit facility bearing interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.3%. The loan agreement requires AFCO OP to make quarterly interest payments on April 1, July 1, October 1 and January 1 of each calendar year. Additionally, the loan agreement requires AFCO OP to pay a quarterly non-usage fee equal to 0.25% of the committed loan amount minus the average outstanding principal balance over the loan amount of the prior three-month period. \nOn February 3, 2017, AFCO OP, in its capacity as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and the Operating Partnership, entered into the Rutledge Amendment and the Company and the Operating Partnership each entered into separate guarantees (the Existing Rutledge Guarantees\u201d) pursuant to which they unconditionally guarantee the obligations of AFCO OP under the Existing Rutledge Loan Agreements. Pursuant to the Rutledge Amendment, among other things, the maturity dates for each of the Existing Rutledge Loan Agreements were extended to January 1, 2022 and the Company and the Operating Partnership were required to execute the Existing Loan Guarantees.\nAs of December 31, 2016 there was $6.6 million outstanding under the Prudential Note.\n\nContractual Obligations\nThe Farm Credit Mortgage Note contains a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants, as well as a covenant requiring us to maintain a debt service coverage ratio of 1.25 to 1.00 beginning on December 31, 2019.\nIn our primary row crop farmland, we see flat to modestly lower rent rates in connection with 2017 lease renewals. This is consistent with, on the one hand, headwinds in primary crop markets and, on the other, tenant demand for leasing high quality farmland. In 2016, we had a higher portion than in 2015 of our fixed cash leases providing for payment of 50% of a year's rent after harvest rather than substantially all of the lease paid prior to harvest, as compared to 2016. This structure better matches operator cash flows. Given per acre revenue on our primary crop farmland and crop insurance levels, we do not expect that this structure materially changes tenant credit risk. Due to the short term nature of most of our primary crop leases, we believe that a recovery of crop prices and farm profitability will be reflected relatively rapidly in our revenues via increases in rent rates. Across specialty crops, operator profitability generally remains healthy. Participating lease structures are common in many specialty crops and base lease rates are consistent with 2016.\nAcquisition and due diligence costs totaled $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $0.3 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2015.

All of our assets are held by, and our operations are primarily conducted through, the Operating Partnership and its wholly owned subsidiaries. As of the date of this Annual Report we own 83.8% of the OP units and none of the Preferred units. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Preferred units.\nHarvested crop inventory includes costs accumulated during both the growing and harvesting phases and is stated at the lower of those costs or the estimated net realizable value, which is the market price, based upon the nearest market in the geographic region, less any cost of disposition. Cost of disposition includes broker's commissions, freight and other marketing costs.\nSubstantially all of our farm leases are structured in such a way that we are responsible for major maintenance, certain insurance and taxes (which are sometimes reimbursed to us by our tenants), while our tenant is responsible for minor maintenance, water usage and all of the additional input costs related to farming operations on the property, such as seed, fertilizer, labor and fuel. We expect that substantially all of the leases for farmland we acquire in the future will continue to be structured in a manner consistent with substantially all of our existing leases. As the owner of the land, we generally only bear costs related to major capital improvements permanently attached to the property, such as irrigation systems, drainage tile, grain storage facilities, permanent plantings or other physical structures customary for farms. In cases where capital expenditures are necessary, we typically seek to offset, over a period of multiple years, the costs of such capital expenditures by increasing rental rates. We also incur the costs associated with maintaining liability and casualty insurance.\nSeasonality\nNM = Not Meaningful\nOn December 21, 2016, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership entered into a loan agreement with The Prudential Insurance Company of America ( Prudential\u201d) which provides for a loan of approximately $6.6 million to\nWe acquired the properties listed in the table below in connection with the AFCO Mergers which closed on February 2, 2017, and, as a result, our portfolio now consists of approximately 75% row crop farmland and 25% specialty crop farmland by value.\nIn connection with the Term Loan 6, on February 14, 2017, the Company and the Operating Partnership each entered into a separate guaranty (the Term Loan 6 Guaranties\u201d) whereby the Company and the Operating Partnership jointly and severally agreed to unconditionally guarantee all of the borrowers' obligations under the Sixth MetLife Loan Agreement.\n2016 Completed Acquisitions\nDuring 2017, $81.2 million of our borrowings will mature. Any cash that we use to satisfy our outstanding debt obligations will reduce the amounts available to acquire additional farms, which could adversely affect our growth prospects. The Company has $45.0 million and $3.1 million in capacity available under the Rutledge and Farm Credit of Central Florida facilities. Within twelve months of this Annual Report, $81.2 million of our borrowings will mature. We anticipate refinancing the debt due to mature in 2017 with the same or similar financial institutions and we are currently in discussions with existing lenders to do so. However, we can provide no assurances that we will be able to refinance the debt on similar terms or at all and thus alternative sources of capital may be necessary. To date, no such capital sources have been identified. As of December 31, 2016, we had $309.9 million of debt, which may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations, restrict our operations and our ability to grow our business and revenues and restrict our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. We plan to refinance these loans in 2017.\n (1) The consideration consisted entirely of OP units. \nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCrop Prices\nAs of December 31, 2016 there was $5.1 million outstanding under the Farm Credit Mortgage Note.

Direct origination costs are netted against loan origination fees and are amortized over the life of the note using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method, as an adjustment to interest income which is included in operating revenues as a component of other revenue in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nProperty operating expenses increased $0.9 million, or 343.4%, for the 2015 year, as compared to the prior year, of which $0.2 million is attributable to properties acquired during 2015. The remaining increase in property operating expenses is primarily related to increases in property insurance of $0.1 million, property taxes of $0.2 million, state franchise taxes of $0.1 million, and repairs of $0.1 million. Also increasing during the year were travel costs related to property visits on newly acquired properties of $0.1 million and $0.1 million of expenses for legal costs related to tenant issues.\nCash rental income for the same-property portfolio remained consistent at $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $2.6 million for 2014, as a result of average annual rent for the same-property portfolio decreasing to $357 per acre in 2015 from $360 per acre in 2014. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower crop share rent in 2015.\nWe believe quality farmland in the United States has a near-zero vacancy rate as a result of the supply and demand fundamentals.

We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis, based on information that is then available to us, our experience and various matters that we believe are reasonable and appropriate for consideration under the circumstances.\n\n\nReal Estate Acquisitions\nIncome Taxes\n \u00b7 Completing 24 acquisitions in 2016 for aggregate cash consideration of $131.8 million, as compared to $109.3 million in aggregate cash consideration for 26 acquisitions in 2015; \nIn connection with the Bond Purchase Agreement, on March 1, 2015, we and the Operating Partnership also entered into a pledge and security agreement (as amended and restated, the Pledge Agreement\u201d) in favor of the Purchaser and Farmer Mac, pursuant to which we and the Operating Partnership agreed to pledge, as collateral for the Farmer Mac Facility, all of their respective right, title and interest in (i) mortgage loans with a value at least equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding bond held by the Purchaser and (ii) such additional collateral as necessary to have total collateral with a value at least equal to 110% of the outstanding notes held by the Purchaser. In addition, we agreed to guarantee the full performance of the Operating Partnership's duties and obligations under the Pledge Agreement.\n \u00b7 Investment of $7.6 million for real estate improvements during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $0.05 million in 2014; and \nIn addition, in August 2015, we announced the launch of the FPI Loan Program, an agricultural lending product aimed at farmers, as a complement to our primary business of acquiring and owning farmland and leasing it to farmers. Under the FPI Loan Program, we make loans to third-party farmers (both tenant and non-tenant) to provide partial financing for working capital requirements and operational farming activities, farming infrastructure projects, and for other farming and agricultural real estate related purposes.\nTenant reimbursements include reimbursements for real estate taxes that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of its lease. When leases require that the tenant reimburse the Company for property taxes paid by the Company, the reimbursement is reflected as tenant reimbursement revenue on the statements of operations, as earned, and the related property tax as property operating expense, as incurred. When a lease requires that the tenant pay the taxing authority directly, the Company does not incur this cost. If and when it becomes probable that a tenant will not be able to bear the property-related costs, the Company will accrue the estimated expense.\n \u00b7 Proceeds from an equity offering of $33.3 million during 2016, compared to total proceeds of $35.1 million from an equity offering during 2015; \nOn January 12, 2017, five wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, entered into a loan agreement (the Fifth MetLife Loan Agreement\u201d) with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ( Metlife\u201d) which provides for a loan of approximately $8.4 million to the Company with a maturity date of January 12, 2027 ( Term Loan 5\u201d). Interest on Term Loan 5 is payable in cash semi-annually and accrues at a 3.26% per annum fixed rate, this may be adjusted by MetLife on each of Janaury 12, 2020, January 12, 2023 and January 12, 2026 at the option of the Lender to a rate that is consistent with similar loans. Proceeds from Term Loan 5 were used to acquire additional properties and for general corporate purposes.\n \u00b7 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt; \nWe further adjust EBITDA for certain additional items such as stock based compensation, indirect offering costs, real estate acquisition related audit fees and real estate related acquisition and due diligence costs (for a full discussion of these adjustments see AFFO adjustments discussed above) that we consider necessary to understand our operating performance. As of September 30, 2015, we began excluding indirect offering costs from EBITDA as we believe it improves\n\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, the following farms are under contract:\nOn January 12, 2017, five wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, entered into the Fifth MetLife Loan Agreement with MetLife which provides for Term Loan 5, a loan of approximately $8.4 million to the Company with a maturity date of January 12, 2027. Interest on Term Loan 5 is payable in cash semi-annually and accrues at a 3.26 % per annum fixed, this may be adjusted by MetLife on each of Janaury 12, 2020, January 12, 2023 and January 12, 2026 at the option of the Lender to a rate that is consistent with similar loans. Proceeds from Term Loan 5 were used to acquire additional properties and for general corporate purposes.\n \u00b7 Indirect offering costs. Indirect offering costs are fees for services incurred by the Company to grow and maintain an active institutional investor presence. As we continue to acquire more farms, our ability to access capital through the equity markets will remain a critical component of our growth strategy. As of September 30, 2015, we began excluding indirect offering costs from AFFO as we believe it improves comparability of our results over each reporting period and of our company with other real estate operators. Prior to this date the company did not incur indirect offering costs. \nOn February 14, 2017, five wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, entered into a loan agreement (the Sixth MetLife Loan Agreement\u201d) with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ( Metlife\u201d) which provides for a loan of approximately $27.2 million to the Company with a maturity date of February 14, 2027 ( Term Loan 6\u201d). Interest on Term Loan 6 is payable in cash semi-annually and accrues at a 3.21% per annum fixed rate, this may be adjusted by MetLife on each of February 14, 2020, February 14, 2023 and February 14, 2026 at the option of the Lender to a rate that is consistent with similar loans. Proceeds from Term Loan 6 were used to acquire additional properties.\nAs described above, on February 2, 2017, we successfully completed the merger with AFCO, which resulted in us acquiring 21 permanent and row crop farms in 2017.\nOn August 31, 2016, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership entered into a loan agreement (the Farm Credit Mortgage Note\u201d) with Farm Credit of Central Florida ( Farm Credit\u201d) which provides for a loan of approximately $8.2 million to the Company with a maturity date of September 1, 2023. As of December 31, 2016 approximately $5.1 million had been drawn down under the Farm Credit Mortgage Note. Interest on the Farm Credit Mortgage Note is payable in cash quarterly and accrues at a floating rate that will be adjusted monthly to a rate per annum equal to the one-month LIBOR plus 2.6875% provided that the interest rate shall be subject to adjustment on the first day of September\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015 we had 23,043,318 and 16,155,971 shares of common stock and OP units outstanding on a fully diluted basis, respectively.\nexpected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. However, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not they will be realized on consideration of available evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies. There was $31,996 in taxable income from the TRS for the year ended December 31, 2016, and no taxable income at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay any outstanding borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, make distributions to our stockholders and to OP unitholders, and other general business needs.\nWe evaluate our tangible and identifiable intangible real estate assets for impairment indicators whenever events such as declines in a property's operating performance, deteriorating market conditions, or environmental or legal concerns bring recoverability of the carrying value of one or more assets into question. If such events are present, we project the total undiscounted cash flows of the asset, including proceeds from disposition, and compare it to the net book value of the asset. If this evaluation indicates that the carrying value may not be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded in earnings equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. There have been no impairments recognized on real estate assets in the accompanying financial statements.\nInterest Rates\nTotal rental income increased $16.1 million, or 119.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year. This increase was the result of the 50 acquisitions completed over the last two years and payments received in connection with the the early termination of certain leases in December 2016. As part of the termination, the Company recognized $3.7 million due to cash received under the contract greater than rental income previously recognized and $2.8 million in early termination fees. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the average annual cash rent for the entire portfolio increased to $224 per acre from $215 per acre in 2015.\nEach of the MetLife Loan Agreements includes certain customary events of default, including a cross-default provision related to other outstanding indebtedness of the borrowers, the Company and the Operating Partnership, the occurrence of which, after any applicable cure period, would permit MetLife, among other things, to accelerate payment of all amounts outstanding under the MetLife Term Loans and to exercise its remedies with respect to the pledged collateral, including foreclosure and sale of the Company's properties that secure the MetLife Term Loans. As of December 31, 2016 there was $142.7 million outstanding under the MetLife Term Loans and we were in compliance with all covenants under the MetLife Loan Agreements.\nHowever, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the operating performance of improvements on our properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. In addition, other equity REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or service indebtedness. FFO also should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP.\n \u00b7 Receipt of $0.3 million of refund related to certain of our mortgage notes payable during 2015 \nOn September 15, 2015, we filed a prospectus supplement under which we may sell shares of common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $25,000,000 through an at-the-market\u201d equity offering program (the ATM Program\u201d). The offering is made pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was declared effective by the SEC on May 14, 2015. As of December 31, 2016, 994,908 shares had been issued under the program for aggregate net proceeds of $11.1 million at a weighted average price per share of $11.17.\nUpon acquisition of real estate, we allocate the purchase price of the real estate based upon the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired, which historically have consisted of land, drainage improvements, irrigation improvements, groundwater, permanent plantings (bushes, shrubs, vines, perennials) and grain facilities and may also consist of intangible assets including in-place leases, above market and below market leases and tenant relationships. We allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the tangible assets of acquired real estate by valuing the land as if it were unimproved. We value improvements, including permanent plantings and grain facilities, at replacement cost as new adjusted for depreciation.\n\nAcquisitions Completed to date in 2017\nAs a REIT, for income tax purposes we are permitted to deduct dividends paid to our stockholders, thereby eliminating the U.S. federal taxation of income represented by such distributions at the Company level, provided certain requirements are met. REITs are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates.\nLeases in place as of December 31, 2016 had terms ranging from one to ten years. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had three leases with rent escalations. The majority of the Company's leases provide for a fixed annual or semi-annual cash rent payment. Tenant leases on acquired farms generally require the tenant to pay the Company rent for the entire initial year regardless of the date of acquisition, if the acquisition is closed prior to, or shortly after, planting of crops. If the acquisition is closed later in the year, the Company typically receives a partial rent payment or no rent payment at all.\n\n \u00b7 Borrowings from mortgage notes payable of $82.5 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to borrowings of $81.1 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2014; \nInterest expense increased by $3.2 million or 236.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of an increase in our average outstanding borrowings, which were $159.2 million\nReal Estate\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nDepreciation and depletion expense increased $0.6 million, or 171.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is the result of acquiring $7.5 million in depreciable assets in the last quarter of 2014, $7.0 million in depreciable assets throughout 2015 and investing $5.6 million in property improvements on acquired property during 2015.\n \u00b7 Stock based compensation. Stock based compensation is a non-cash expense and therefore, does not correlate with the ongoing operations. We believe that excluding these costs from AFFO improves comparability of our results over each reporting period and of our company with other real estate operators. \n \u00b7 Funding of $2.8 million in notes receivable, which was offset by $0.02 million of net origination fees received in 2015. \n\nCertain of the Company's leases provide for a rent payment determined as a percentage of the gross farm proceeds or a percentage of harvested crops. As of December 31, 2016, a majority of such leases provided for a rent payment determined as a percentage of the gross farm proceeds. Revenue under leases providing for a payment equal to a percentage of the harvested crop or a percentage of the gross farm proceeds are recorded at the guaranteed crop insurance minimums and recognized ratably over the lease term during the crop year. Upon notification from the grain facility that grain has been delivered in the Company's name, a future contract for delivery of the harvest has been finalized or when the tenant has notified the Company of the total amount of gross farm proceeds, revenue is recognized.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nBecause the leases for a many of the properties in our portfolio require significant payments in advance of the spring planting season, we receive a significant portion of our cash rental payments in the first calendar quarter of each year, although we recognize rental revenue from these leases on a pro rata basis over the non-cancellable term of the lease in accordance with GAAP.\nFor a summary of the new or revised accounting standards please refer to Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies\u201d within the notes to the combined consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nstraight-line basis and the cash rent received from tenants in accordance with the lease terms. Acquired below market leases are included in deferred revenue on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, which are amortized into rental income over the life of the respective leases, plus the terms of the below market renewal options, if any.\nOur exposure to short-term crop price declines is limited as most of our leases do not factor in per bushel prices and instead are set on a rental rate per acre basis. This approach is common throughout agriculture for several reasons. This approach recognizes that the value of leased land to a tenant is more closely linked to the total revenue produced on the property which is driven by crop yield and crop price. This approach simplifies the administrative requirements for the\n \u00b7 Other contractual debt payments of $84.8 million made in 2016, compared to $6.1 million in contractual debt payments made during 2015; \nbelieve that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs.\nConditions in Our Existing Markets\nGlobal supply of agricultural commodities is driven by two primary factors, the number of tillable acres available for crop production and the productivity of the acres being farmed. Although the amount of global cropland in use has gradually increased over time, growth has plateaued over the last 20 years. Cropland area continues to increase in developing countries, but after accounting for expected continuing cropland loss, the UN FAO projects only 171 million acres will be added from 2005-2007 to 2050, a 4.3% increase. In comparison, world population is expected to grow over the same period to 9.7 billion, a nearly 40% increase. While we expect growth in the global supply of arable land, we also expect that landowners will only put that land into production if increases in commodity prices and the value of farmland\nOn June 29, 2016, five wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership entered into a loan agreement (the Second MetLife Loan Agreement\u201d) with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ( MetLife\u201d), which provides for a loan of approximately $15.7 million (the Term Loan 4\u201d) to the Company with a maturity date of June 29, 2026. Interest on Term Loan 4 is payable in cash semi-annually and accrues at a floating rate that will be adjusted quarterly to a rate per annum equal to the greater of (a) the three-month LIBOR plus an initial floating rate spread of 1.750%, which may be adjusted by MetLife on each of September 29, December 29, March 29 and June 29 of each year to an interest rate equal to the greater of (a) the three month LIBOR plus the floating rate spread or (b) 2.00% per annum. The Loan initially bears interest at a rate of 2.39% per annum until September 29, 2016. On September 29, 2016 the rate increased to 2.59% per annum. Proceeds from Term Loan 4 were used to acquire additional properties and for general corporate purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $47.2 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to $23.5 million at December 31, 2015.\n\nWe are party to the Amended and Restated Bond Purchase Agreement, dated as of March 1, 2015 and amended on June 2, 2015 and August 3, 2015 (the Bond Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation ( Farmer Mac\u201d) and Farmer Mac Mortgage Securities Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Farmer Mac, as bond purchaser (the Purchaser\u201d), regarding a secured bond purchase facility (the Farmer Mac Facility\u201d) that has a maximum borrowing capacity of $165 million. Pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement, the Operating Partnership may, from time to time, issue one or more bonds to the Purchaser that will be secured by pools of mortgage loans, which will, in turn, be secured by first liens on agricultural real estate owned by us. The mortgage loans may have effective loan-to-value ratios of up to 60%, after giving effect to the overcollateralization obligations described below. Prepayment of each bond issuance is not permitted unless otherwise agreed upon by all parties to the Bond Purchase Agreement.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nAs of December 31, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\n \u00b7 Repurchase and retirement of $0.02 million of common stock during 2015. \nAs part of the AFCO Mergers, by virtue of AFCO OP becoming a subsidiary of the Company, the Company acquired the Existing Rutledge Loans, which are further described below:\n \u00b7 Distributions on Preferred units. Dividends on Preferred units, which are convertible into OP units on or after March 2, 2026, have a fixed and certain impact on our cash flow, thus they are subtracted from FFO. We believe this improves comparability of our company with other real estate operators. \nIn prior periods, our calculation of AFFO also adjusted FFO to reflect the difference between the pro rata contractual cash revenue for each crop year spread equally over the quarterly periods of ownership (without regard to the date of acquisition within the quarter) and the rent recognized on a straight-line basis in accordance with GAAP. In prior filings with the SEC, we referred to this adjustment as crop-year revenue adjustment.\u201d For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the crop-year revenue adjustment was $1.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively. In accordance with recently released interpretation from the SEC regarding the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, we no longer include the crop-year revenue adjustment in our calculation of AFFO.\n \u00b7 Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting the usefulness as a comparative measure. \nNet cash used for investing activities increased $17.7 million primarily as a result of the following:\nRental Revenues\n \u00b7 Debt prepayments of $0 on the First Midwest bank debt during 2016, as compared to $3.1 million in 2015; \nPrudential Loans\n \u00b7 Payments of $0.8 million in offering costs made during 2015, as compared to $2.3 million in payments during 2014; \nInterest expense increased by $5.3 million or 115.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. We recognized additional interest expense of approximately $2.4 million during 2016 related to interest and amortization of deferred loan fees associated with the $53.0 million Bridge Loan (as defined below under Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d), as all costs related to the Bridge Loan were both incurred and amortized during 2016. The increase in interest expense is due, in large part, to interest on the Bridge Loan of $2.3 million, which we do not expect to continue as we do not expect to enter into similar short term financing arrangements in the future. Interest expense increased approximately $3.1 million as the result of an increase in our outstanding borrowings during 2016, which were $309.9 million as of December 31, 2016 and $187.2 million for the comparative period in 2015. These increases were partially offset by the amortization of deferred financing fees and discounts/premiums on debt which increased $0.1 million during 2016.\nInterest on Term Loan 1 is payable in cash semi-annually and accrues at a floating rate that will be adjusted quarterly to a rate per annum equal to the greater of (a) the three-month LIBOR plus an initial floating rate spread of 1.750%, which may be adjusted by MetLife on each of March 29, 2019, March 29, 2022 and March 29, 2025 to an interest rate consistent with interest rates quoted by MetLife for substantially similar loans secured by real estate substantially similar to the Company's properties securing Term Loan 1 or (b) 2.000% per annum. Term Loan 1 bore interest at a rate of 2.40% per annum until September 29, 2016. On September 29, 2016 the rate increased to 2.59%. Subject to certain conditions, we may at any time during the term of Term Loan 1 elect to have all or any portion of the unpaid balance of Term Loan 1 bear interest at a fixed rate that is initially established by the lender in its sole discretion that may be adjusted from time to time to an interest rate consistent with interest rates quoted by MetLife for substantially similar loans secured by real estate substantially similar to the Company's properties securing Term Loan 1. On any floating rate adjustment date, we may prepay any portion of Term Loan 1 that is not subject to a fixed rate without penalty.\nduring the year December 31, 2015 and $44.4 million for 2014. Our weighted average cost of borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 2.80% and 2.76%, respectively. We also recognized additional interest expense of $0.2 million and $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to the amortization of deferred loan fees. These increases were partially offset by the amortization of a premium on our debt of $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe have or are currently negotiating leases on 50,721 acres and have 3,978 acres which have lease payments based solely on a percentage of farming revenues or crops, which are not included in the table above. We expect that rents for primary crop farmland will experience a modest decline in 2017, partially counterbalanced throughout our portfolio by rent increases deriving from farm improvements, such as irrigation, drainage and grain storage, that were or will be put in service for the 2017 crop year. We expect that rents for specialty crop farmland will be flat to modestly increasing.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nExpenses\n \u00b7 An increase in cash paid for interest of $2.9 million due to an increase in average outstanding indebtedness of approximately $115.5 million, year-to-year. \n \u00b7 Payments of $1.1 million in financing fees made during 2016, as compared to $0.2 million in payments during 2015; and ", "item_7_tables": "Table 112: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

December 31, 2016, compared to December 31, 2015. Some of the key points include:\n\n- General and administrative expenses rose by $2.8 million or 67.5% due to an expansion in the company's portfolio and an increase in employee compensation expenses, associated with a growing number of employees and a new benefits program.\n- The report includes a detailed breakdown of acres managed and associated cash rents percentages.\n- Operating revenues saw a remarkable increase, with rental income jumping by 119% due to acquisitions and lease terminations, while tenant reimbursements and other revenue also saw significant increases.\n- Operating expenses grew across various categories, such as depreciation and depletion, property operating expenses, acquisition and due diligence costs, general and administrative expenses, and legal and accounting, due to expanded operations and public company costs.\n- Cash flow from operating activities displays fluctuations, with a noted decrease due to factors like increased interest payments and rental income timing.\n- The company finished several leasing transactions and terminated some leases with a settlement that resulted in additional revenue.\n- There's an outline of contractual obligations and commitments, indicating the company's financial commitments in the forthcoming periods.\n- Acquisitions expected to close in the first half of 2017 are mentioned but come with the usual risks of uncertainty.\n- The Operating Partnership leases certain farms, for which there is a system to handle income taxes through asset and liability methods, considering deferred tax assets and liabilities for differences between financial reporting basis and their tax basis.\n- A table shows the financial impact of certain acquisitions, which include the states where the farms are located, the dates acquired, the approximate acres, and the purchase price.\n- The company's farm leases are mostly short-term (one to five years), with a couple having ten-year terms. Tenants are responsible for a considerable portion of the operating expenses, and as a result, inflationary impact might be limited for the company.\n\nThe summary above is a truncated version of the comprehensive financial details and operating metrics provided in the original report and ignores the tabulated information for brevity."}
