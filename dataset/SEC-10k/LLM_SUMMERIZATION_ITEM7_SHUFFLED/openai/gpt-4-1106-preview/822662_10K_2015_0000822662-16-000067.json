Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REVIEW\nThe following management discussion and analysis addresses important factors affecting our results of operations and financial condition as of and for the periods indicated. The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with this review.\nOverview\nSince our inception in 1973, we have pursued managed profitable growth through providing quality financial services. Our overall focus is on building shareholder value. Our mission is to continue growth, improve earnings and increase shareholder value; to treat customers, employees, community and shareholders according to the Golden Rule; and to operate within a culture of strong internal controls.\nOur franchise primarily spans the metropolitan Atlanta market and Jacksonville, Orlando and Sarasota-Bradenton, Florida. We also conduct indirect automobile lending, residential mortgage lending and SBA lending activities in thirteen states.\nDuring 2015, we continued to expand our footprint and customer base with the opening of additional offices in our retail banking, mortgage lending, and indirect automobile lending divisions including the commencement of indirect automobile lending activities in Oklahoma, expansion of mortgage lending activities into North and South Carolina, the expansion of our retail branch network in Georgia and northern and central Florida through acquisitions, and de novo branch openings. Trust and wealth management began operations in July 2014 and continues to grow.\nOur lending activities are significantly influenced by the local economic environments in the markets we serve. We have grown our consumer installment, mortgage, construction and commercial loan portfolios organically and through acquisition as the economy continues to improve. Our loan portfolio is well diversified among consumer, business, and real estate lending. The credit quality of the loans we have originated continues to be strong.\nFinancial Performance\nWe recorded net income of $39.1 million in 2015 compared to $30.0 million in 2014, an increase of $9.1 million, or 30.3%. Net income per basic and diluted common share were $1.77 and $1.64, respectively, for 2015 and $1.41 and $1.28, respectively, for 2014. The increases of $32.6 million or 34.2% in noninterest income and $10.4 million, or 11.5%, in net interest income were the main factors impacting our earnings growth in 2015. These increases in income were partially offset by increases in noninterest expense in 2015 of $24.2 million or 17.4% and provision expense of $3.8 million.\nWe derive approximately half of our revenues from noninterest income sources such as service charges on loan and deposit accounts, fees on other services and income from mortgage banking, indirect automobile, and SBA activities. The majority of the noninterest income earned on these loan portfolios is generated from gains on sales of loans including recognition of loan servicing on the majority of loans sold. The retained servicing generates servicing revenue over the life of the loans sold. The revenue generated from gains on sales of loans and related servicing is partially offset by amortization and possible impairment of the related servicing rights. Servicing rights are amortized in proportion to the estimated future servicing income on the underlying loans sold. Impairment on servicing rights is recorded based on changes in the estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses on the underlying loans sold.\nA portion of our profitability, as with most financial institutions, is dependent upon net interest income, which is the difference between the interest we receive on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Our net interest margin is affected by prevailing interest rates, nonperforming assets and competition among financial institutions for loans and deposits.\nWe continue to attract new customer relationships, and talented and experienced bankers to support our growth. The focus in 2016 will be to successfully integrate our recent acquisitions, and on credit quality, revenue growth, expense controls, deposit growth and quality loan growth either organically or through acquisition.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and conform to general practices within the financial services industry. Our financial position and results of operations are affected by management's application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions, and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Different assumptions in the application of these policies, or conditions significantly different from certain assumptions, could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. Our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d Significant accounting policies have been periodically discussed and reviewed with and approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors.\nThe following is a summary of our critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on management's estimates, assumptions, and judgments.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is established and maintained through provisions charged to operations. Such provisions are based on management's evaluation of the loan portfolio, including loan portfolio concentrations, current economic conditions, past loan loss experience, adequacy of underlying collateral, and such other factors which, in management's judgment, deserve consideration in estimating loan losses. Loans are charged off when, in the opinion of management, such loans are deemed to be uncollectable. Subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance.\nA formal review of the allowance for loan losses is prepared quarterly to assess the probable credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio and to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. For purposes of the monthly management review, the loan portfolio is separated by loan type. The level of allowance required for each loan type is determined based upon historical charge-off experience and current economic trends. In addition to homogeneous pools of loans, every commercial, commercial real estate, SBA, and construction loan is assigned a risk rating using established credit policy guidelines. All nonperforming commercial, commercial real estate, SBA, and construction loans and loans deemed to have greater than normal risk characteristics are reviewed monthly by our Credit Review Department to determine the level of additional allowance for loan losses, if any, required to be specifically assigned to these loans.\nAcquisition Accounting\nWe have accounted for our acquisitions as business combinations. As such, the purchase price is allocated to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Generally accepted accounting principles require the use of fair values in determining the carrying values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, as well as for specific disclosures. The calculation of fair value of loans and foreclosed property acquired in a business combination requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than for the remainder of acquired assets or assumed liabilities.\nDetermining the fair value of assets and liabilities, particularly illiquid assets and liabilities, is a complicated process involving significant judgment regarding estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated fair value. Information regarding our loan discount and core deposit intangible asset may be adjusted as we refine our estimates. Purchase price allocations on completed acquisitions may be modified through the measurement date which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date. If we recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period, the amounts will be reported in the period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Fair value adjustments based on updated estimates could materially affect the goodwill, if any, recorded on the acquisition.\nWe segregate loans acquired between loans for which there was a discount related, in part, to credit and loans for which there was not a material discount attributable to credit. Subsequent to the acquisition date, decreases in expected cash flows compared to initial estimates on the loans for which there was a credit discount are recognized as impairment through the provision for loan losses. Probable and significant increases in cash flows (in a loan pool where an allowance for acquired loan losses was previously recorded) reduces the remaining allowance for acquired loan losses before recalculating the amount of accretable yield percentage for the loan pool.\nWe account for the discount on loans which do not have a discount materially attributable to credit or revolving type loans by accreting the discount on each individual loan over time using a level yield approach based on the expected cash flows for term loans or on a straight-line basis for revolving loans. The methodology also considers the remaining fair value discounts recognized upon acquisition associated with purchased non-impaired loans in estimating a general allowance and also includes establishing an ALL for purchased credit-impaired loans that have deteriorated since acquisition.\nThe credit risks inherent and evidenced in our past FDIC-assisted transactions resulted in a portion of the loans purchased in those transactions having a credit discount. On the date of acquisition, when the loans had evidence of credit deterioration since their origination and we believed it was probable that we would not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, we refer to the difference between contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected as the non-accretable discount. We estimate expected cash flows at each future reporting date. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows generally result in a provision for loan losses, net of the amount due from the FDIC under the applicable loss share agreement. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and adjusted accretable discount, which has a positive effect on interest income. We have recorded acquired covered loans at fair value, exclusive of the loss share agreements with the FDIC.\nBecause we record acquired loans at fair value, we recorded no allowance for loan losses related to the acquired loans on the acquisition date, given that the fair value of the loans acquired incorporates assumptions regarding credit risk. The fair value estimates associated with the acquired loans include estimates related to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of expected principal, interest and other cash flows.\nOther Real Estate\nORE, consisting of properties obtained through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of loans, is initially reported at fair value, determined on the basis of current appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates of value obtained principally from independent sources, adjusted for estimated selling costs. Management also considers other factors, including changed economic conditions since the last appraisal, changes in absorption rates, stale appraisals or imprecision and subjectivity of the appraisal process, length of time the property has been on the market and anticipated sales values, which have resulted in adjustments to the collateral value estimates indicated in certain appraisals.\nSignificant judgments and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of ORE. As a result of the significant judgments required in estimating fair value and the variables involved in different methods of disposition, the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates used to determine the fair value of ORE. The period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility.\nAt the time of foreclosure or initial possession of collateral, any excess of the loan balance over the fair value of the real estate held as collateral is treated as a charge against the allowance for loan losses, net of amounts covered under loss share agreements with the FDIC. After the transfer to ORE, the fair value, less estimated selling costs, becomes the new cost basis for the ORE. Subsequent declines in the fair value of ORE, net of amounts covered under loss share agreements with the FDIC, below the new cost basis are recognized by a charge to income.\nManagement reviews the value of ORE on at least a quarterly basis and adjusts the values as appropriate. Generally, a new appraisal is received annually on each ORE property. Any subsequent adjustments to reflect changes in fair value and selling costs are recorded as a component of other noninterest expense or a reduction of any existing valuation allowance on a property by property basis, but not below zero. In response to market conditions and other economic factors, management may utilize liquidation sales as part of its problem asset disposition strategy.\nRevenue from ORE operations as well as gains or losses on sales are recorded as a component of noninterest income, net of amounts due to/from the FDIC on ORE covered under loss share agreements. Expenses from ORE operations are recorded as a component of noninterest expense, net of amounts due from the FDIC on ORE covered under loss share agreements.\nCapitalized Servicing Assets and Liabilities\nWe sell indirect automobile loan pools, residential mortgages and SBA loans with servicing retained. When the contractual servicing fees on loans sold with servicing retained are expected to be more than adequate compensation to a servicer for performing the servicing, a capitalized servicing asset is recognized. When the expected costs to a servicer for performing loan servicing are not expected to adequately compensate a servicer, a capitalized servicing liability is recognized. Servicing assets and servicing liabilities are amortized over the expected lives of the serviced loans utilizing the interest method. Management makes certain estimates and assumptions related to costs to service varying types of loans and pools of loans, the projected lives of loans and pools of loans sold, and discount factors used in calculating the present values of servicing fees projected to be received.\nNo less frequently than quarterly, management reviews the status of all loans and pools of loans sold with related capitalized servicing assets to determine if there is any impairment to those assets due to such factors as earlier than estimated repayments or significant prepayments. Any impairment identified in these assets will result in reductions in their carrying values through a valuation allowance and a corresponding increase in operating expenses.\nIncome Taxes\nWe file a consolidated federal income tax return, as well as tax returns in several states. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled. The net deferred tax asset is reviewed at each reporting period to assess the probability of realization of benefits in future periods and whether valuation allowances are appropriate. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded in situations where it is more likely than not\u201d that a deferred tax asset is not realizable. Management has reviewed all evidence, both positive and negative, and concluded that a valuation allowance against any deferred tax asset is not needed at December 31, 2015. The calculation of the income tax provision is complex and requires the use of judgments and estimates in its determination.\nFair Value\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3\nmeasurements). A financial instrument's level within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe primary financial instruments we carry at fair value are investment securities, interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans ( IRLCs\u201d), derivative instruments, and residential mortgage loans held-for-sale. We also carry certain impaired loans, foreclosed assets and capitalized servicing rights on residential mortgage and SBA loans at fair value.\nInvestment securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. For these securities, we obtain fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the bond's terms and conditions, among other things. The investments in our portfolio are generally not quoted on an exchange but are actively traded in the secondary institutional markets.\nWe classify IRLCs on a gross basis within other liabilities or other assets. The fair value of these commitments, while based on interest rates observable in the market, is highly dependent on the ultimate closing of the loans. These pull-through\u201d rates are based on both our historical data and the current interest rate environment and reflect our best estimate of the likelihood that a commitment will ultimately result in a closed loan. The loan servicing value is also included in the fair value of the IRLCs.\nDerivative instruments are primarily transacted in the secondary mortgage and institutional dealer markets and priced with observable market assumptions at a mid-market valuation point, with appropriate valuation adjustments for liquidity and credit risk. For purposes of valuation adjustments to our derivative positions, we evaluate liquidity premiums that may be demanded by market participants, as well as the credit risk of our counterparties and our own credit.\nThe credit risk associated with the underlying cash flows of instruments carried at fair value was a consideration in estimating the fair value of certain financial instruments. Credit risk was considered in the valuation through a variety of inputs, as applicable, including, the actual default and loss severity of the collateral, and level of subordination. The assumptions used to estimate credit risk incorporated relevant information that a market participant would likely use in valuing an instrument.\nThe fair value of residential mortgage loans held-for-sale is based on what secondary markets are currently offering for portfolios with similar characteristics. As such, we classify these loans as Level 2.\nSBA and indirect loans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value. Fair value is based on recent trades for similar loan pools as well as offering prices for similar assets provided by buyers in the secondary market. If the cost of a loan is determined to be less than the fair value of similar loans, the impairment is recorded by the establishment of a reserve to reduce the value of the loan.\nImpaired loans are evaluated and valued at the time the loan is identified as impaired, at the lower of cost or fair value. Fair value is measured based on the value of the collateral securing these loans and is classified as a Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Collateral may include real estate or business assets, including equipment, inventory and accounts receivable. The value of real estate collateral is determined based on an appraisal by qualified licensed appraisers. If significant, the value of business equipment is based on an appraisal by qualified licensed appraisers; otherwise, the equipment's net book value on the business' financial statements is the basis for the value of business equipment. Inventory and accounts receivable collateral are valued based on independent field examiner review or aging reports. Appraised and reported values may be discounted based on management's historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management's expertise and knowledge of the client and client's business. Impaired loans are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly.\nForeclosed assets are adjusted to fair value upon transfer of the loans to foreclosed assets. Subsequently, foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value less estimated selling costs. Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management's estimation of the value of the collateral. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value, we record the foreclosed asset as nonrecurring Level 2. When an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price, we record the foreclosed asset as nonrecurring Level 3. Appraised and reported values may be discounted based on management's historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management's expertise and knowledge of the client and client's business.\nCapitalized servicing rights on indirect auto, SBA, and residential mortgage loans are initially recorded at fair value when the underlying loans are sold with servicing retained. These assets are then amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income. On a monthly basis, these servicing assets are assessed for impairment based on fair value. Management determines fair value by stratifying the servicing portfolio into homogeneous subsets with unique behavior characteristics, converting those characteristics into income and expense streams, adjusting those streams for prepayments, present valuing the adjusted streams, and combining the present values into a total. If the cost basis of any loan stratification tranche is higher than the present value of the tranche, an impairment is recorded through a valuation allowance.\nResults of Operations - 2015 Compared to 2014\nNet Income\nOur net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $39.1 million and we reported basic and fully diluted earnings per share of $1.77 and $1.64, respectively. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $30.0 million and basic and fully diluted earnings per share were $1.41 and $1.28, respectively. The $9.1 million increase in net income in 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to an increase in interest income of $15.0 million, partially offset by an increase in provision for loan losses expense of $3.8 million, and an increase in interest expense of $4.6 million. In addition, there was an increase in noninterest income of $32.6 million and an increase in noninterest expense of $24.2 million. Details of the changes in the various components of net income are discussed below.\nNet Interest Income/Margin\nA portion of our profitability, as with most financial institutions, is dependent upon net interest income, which is the difference between the interest we receive on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Our net interest margin is affected by prevailing interest rates, nonperforming assets and competition among financial institutions for loans and deposits.\nTaxable-equivalent net interest income was $101.2 million in 2015 compared to $90.8 million in 2014, an increase of $10.4 million, or 11.5%. Average interest-earning assets in 2015 increased $609.1 million to $3.1 billion, a 24.3% increase when compared to 2014. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $490.1 million to $2.4 billion, a 25.8% increase. The net interest margin decreased by 38 basis points to 3.24% in 2015 when compared to 2014. The primary components of the net interest margin are described below.\nTaxable-equivalent interest income had an increase of $15.0 million for 2015 as compared to 2014. Although the yield on interest-earning assets in 2015 reflected a 32 basis point decrease as compared to 2014, interest income increased due to the net growth of $609.1 million, or 24.3%, in average interest-earning assets, primarily in our loan portfolio. The average balance of loans outstanding in 2015 increased $611.6 million, or 26.8%, to $2.9 billion when compared to 2014 due to the increased number of loan originations and market expansion, including $181.3 million in loans acquired, net of loan payoffs and problem loan resolutions. However, consistent with changes in market interest rates, the yield on average loans for 2015 decreased 38 basis points to 3.86% when compared to 2014.\nInterest expense in 2015 increased $4.6 million, or 40.8%, to $15.8 million, primarily as the result of a 7 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and a $490.1 million, or 25.8%, increase in average interest-bearing liability balances. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities for 2015 was due to organic growth, as well as acquisitions of $365.7 million in interest bearing deposits along with the issuance of $75.0 million in subordinated debt in May 2015.\nAverage interest-bearing deposits increased $364.9 million, or 21.2%, to $2.1 billion during 2015 compared to 2014, while average borrowings increased $125.2 million, or 69.2%, to $306.0 million. The increase in average interest-bearing deposits was primarily due to an increase of $167.5 million in interest-bearing money market and NOW deposits, and $191.4 million in time deposits, a result of both organic growth and acquisitions. The increase in interest expense in 2015 was primarily attributable to the $2.7 million increase in subordinated debt expense, as a result of the subordinated debt issuance. In addition, interest expense on interest bearing deposits increased $1.6 million, as average balances increased as discussed above.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information regarding (i) the total dollar amount of interest income from earning assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant average rate; (iii) net interest income; (iv) net interest spread; and (v) net interest margin. The average balances are principally daily averages, and, for loans, include both performing and non-performing balances. Interest income on loans includes the effects of discount accretion on purchased credit impaired ( PCI\u201d) loans acquired in the FDIC-assisted transactions and net deferred loan origination costs accounted for as yield adjustments.\nAverage Balances, Interest and Yields\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

components in proportion to the relationship of the dollar amounts of the change.\n(2) Reflects fully taxable equivalent adjustments using a Federal tax rate of 35%.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nManagement's policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries, net of amounts due from the FDIC under the loss sharing agreements for our past FDIC-assisted transactions.\nThe provision for loan losses was $4.4 million in 2015 and $531,000 in 2014. Net charge-offs were $3.1 million in 2015 as compared to $6.7 million in 2014. The increase in the provision in 2015, compared to 2014 was primarily due to net new loans originated during 2015 even as credit quality continued to improve. Average nonperforming assets were $62.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $75.9 million for the same period in 2014, a decrease of $13.9 million or 18.3%.\nThe allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans outstanding at the end of 2015 and 2014 was 0.91% and 1.13%, respectively. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans outstanding, excluding acquired loans, at the end of 2015 and 2014 was 0.97% and 1.15%, respectively. The improvement in asset quality over the past several years has offset the need for a higher allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans as a result of loan growth.\nAnalysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses\nThe following table outlines the changes in our allowance for losses during the five-year period ended December 31, 2015.

Net recoveries on construction loans were higher during 2014 primarily due to a recovery of $1.5 million on one relationship during 2014.\nCommercial net charge-offs decreased $4.2 million during 2015 from $5.4 million in 2014 to $1.2 million in 2015, primarily as a result of several large loan charge-offs in the prior year.\nNet charge-offs on consumer loans increased slightly in 2015 to $3.0 million and continue to comprise the majority of the net charge-offs. However, net charge-offs have decreased as a percentage of the average loans outstanding for this portfolio as indirect auto balances have grown steadily during the past five years.\nNoninterest Income\nWe derive approximately half of our revenues from noninterest income sources such as service charges on loan and deposit accounts and fees on other services; income from mortgage banking, indirect automobile, and SBA activities; and gains on ORE sales. The majority of this revenue is earned from gains on sales of loans. We retain servicing on the majority of loans sold which generates servicing revenue over the remaining life of the loans sold.\nThe categories of noninterest income, and the dollar and percentage change between the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, are as follows:\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service charges on deposit accounts\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other fees and charges\n</td> <td>5,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage banking activities\n</td> <td>85,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Indirect lending activities\n</td> <td>18,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SBA lending activities\n</td> <td>5,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank owned life insurance\n</td> <td>2,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securities (losses) gains\n</td> <td>(329\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(329\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>5,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest income for 2015 was $127.9 million compared to $95.3 million in 2014, a 34.2% increase. This increase was primarily due to a increases in revenues from mortgage banking, as described below.\nMortgage banking revenues increased $29.8 million to $85.5 million in 2015, compared to $55.8 million in 2014, an increase of 53.3%. The increase was due to increased mortgage loan production. Mortgage production for the year increased from $1.9 billion in 2014 to $2.7 billion in 2015, a $739.2 million, or 38.2%, year over year change. Increased production led to an increase in the total of residential mortgage loans sold, an increase from $1.8 billion in 2014 to $2.5 billion in 2015, a $696.4 million or 39.0% year over year change. Gain on sales of mortgage loans increased $26.7 million or 61.9%, year over year, from $43.1 million in 2014 to $69.8 million in 2015. In addition to the volume increase, we were was able to realize a 17% higher margin on loan sales during 2015. Higher margins were, in part, the result of an increase in the margin charged on all products and in part, the result of a higher percentage of loans sold into GNMA MBS, 23.5% of total sales in 2015 compared to 20.7% in 2014. Loans in GNMA MBS can typically be originated with higher margins compared to other product type originations.\nNoninterest Expense\nThe categories of noninterest expense, and the dollar and percentage change between the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and employee benefits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commissions\n</td> <td>27,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net occupancy\n</td> <td>15,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Communication\n</td> <td>4,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>38,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>138,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest expense during 2015 increased $24.2 million, or 17.4%, to $162.9 million when compared to 2014, primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits, and increases in net occupancy expenses, as the number of branches and mortgage loan production offices continued to grow in 2015.\nSalaries and benefits expense increased $9.9 million, or 14.7%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to the higher salaries associated with the net addition of 208 full-time equivalent employees during 2015, primarily as a result of opening or acquiring the twelve new branches during the year as well as additional mortgage and SBA locations in 2015 and the associated back-office and administrative support functions. Additional mortgage loan production offices are expected to open in 2016, although fewer than 2015, so we expect salaries and benefits to increase in 2016. However, the increase should not be exactly proportional, as we expect to capitalize on economies of scale.\nCommissions increased by $7.4 million, or 36.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $27.3 million as compared to $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase occurred primarily as production increased $739 million in the mortgage division during 2015 as the commissions are a variable expense that is calculated as a percentage of the loan production in the division. Total mortgage production is expected to increase in 2016, primarily due to the strength of purchase money mortgages demand in our mortgage production footprint. As such, we expect commissions to increase in 2016 in line with production growth.\nCommunication and net occupancy expenses increased by $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $20.2 million as compared to $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in communication expense is primarily attributable to increases in telephone and postage expenses over the course of the year. Both of these increases are in relation to the increase in the number of locations associated with the Bank's strategy of growth and acquisition. The increase in net occupancy expense is primarily due to increases in rental expense and depreciation expense year over year. Net occupancy acquisition related expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled approximately $500,000 relating primarily to computer hardware,\nequipment, and branch signage, primarily associated with the acquisition of The Bank of Georgia in October 2015. The acquisition related expenditures are capitalized and expensed to depreciation over the estimated useful life. The increase in communication expense is primarily attributable to increases in telephone and postage expenses over the course of the year. Both of these increases are in relation to the increase in the number of locations associated with the Bank's strategy of growth and acquisition.\nOther operating expenses were $38.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a $3.6 million, or 10.4%, increase compared to $34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of increases associated with acquisitions and new locations. Acquisition related expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled approximately $1.5 million relating to the costs associated with professional fees, conversion, and integration.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe provision for income taxes expense for 2015 and 2014 was $22.3 million and $16.4 million, respectively, with effective tax rates of 36.3% and 35.4%, respectively. The primary driver of the change in expense was an increase in the level of pre-tax income. In addition, the effective tax rate increased between periods due to growth in taxable income exceeding growth in permanent difference items.\nResults of Operations - 2014 Compared to 2013\nNet Income\nOur net income for the year ended December 31, 2014, was $30.0 million or basic and fully diluted earnings per share of $1.41 and $1.28, respectively. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2013, was $27.6 million or basic and fully diluted earnings per share of $1.35 and $1.21, respectively. The $2.4 million increase in net income in 2014 compared to 2013 was due primarily to an increase in interest income of $4.1 million, a decrease in provision expense of $4.9 million, and a decrease in interest expense of $2.7 million. Partially offsetting these items was an increase in noninterest expense of $6.4 million. Details of the changes in the various components of net income are discussed below.\nNet Interest Income/Margin\nTaxable-equivalent net interest income was $90.8 million in 2014 compared to $84.0 million in 2013, an increase of $6.9 million, or 8.2%. Average interest-earning assets in 2014 increased $164.8 million to $2.5 billion, a 7.0% increase when compared to 2013. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $25.9 million to $1.9 billion, a 1.4% increase. The net interest margin increased by 4 basis points to 3.62% in 2014 when compared to 2013. The primary components of the net interest margin are described below.\nTaxable-equivalent interest income had an increase of $4.1 million for 2014 as compared to 2013. Although the yield on interest-earning assets in 2014 reflected an 11 basis point decrease as compared to 2013, the resulting decrease in interest income was offset by the additional interest income earned during 2014 on the net growth of $164.8 million, or 7.0%, in average interest-earning assets, primarily in our loan portfolio. The average balance of loans outstanding in 2014 increased $174.7 million, or 8.3%, to $2.3 billion when compared to 2013 due to the increased number of loan originations and market expansion, net of loan payoffs and problem loan resolutions. However, consistent with changes in market interest rates, the yield on average loans outstanding for 2014 decreased 20 basis points to 4.24% when compared to 2013, primarily in the indirect automobile component of the consumer loan portfolio. Average interest-bearing deposits held at correspondent banks decreased $14.9 million to $49.2 million to fund loan growth throughout 2014.\nInterest expense in 2014 decreased $2.7 million, or 19.6%, to $11.2 million, primarily as the result of a 15 basis point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, net of a $25.9 million, or 1.4%, increase in average interest-bearing liability balances. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities for 2014 was primarily used to fund growth in the indirect automobile loan portfolio at various times throughout the year. The reduction in the cost of interest bearing deposits is due to management's strategy of focusing on lower cost core deposits. Average total interest-bearing deposits increased $35.0 million, or 2.1%, to $1.7 billion during 2014 compared to 2013, while average borrowings decreased $9.1 million, or 4.8%, to $180.9 million. The increase in average total interest-bearing deposits was primarily due to an increase of $73.7 million in interest-bearing money market and NOW deposits. The decrease in interest expense in 2014 was primarily attributable to the $1.6 million decrease in subordinated debt expense, as a result of the Company repaying $21 million of subordinated debt during the third quarter of 2013. In addition to this, interest expense on short-term borrowings had a decrease of $323,000, as rates have declined year over year.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses was $531,000 in 2014 and $5.4 million in 2013. Net charge-offs were $6.7 million in 2014, compared to $6.9 million in 2013. The decrease in the provision in 2014, compared to 2013 was primarily due to improved credit quality in the loan portfolio and a decrease in net charge-offs. Average nonperforming assets were $62.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $75.9 million for the same period in 2013, a decrease of $13.9 million or 18.3%.\nThe allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans outstanding at the end of 2014 and 2013 was 1.13% and 1.78%, respectively.\nNoninterest Income\nThe categories of noninterest income, and the dollar and percentage change between the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, are as follows:\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service charges on deposit accounts\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other fees and charges\n</td> <td>4,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage banking activities\n</td> <td>55,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,779\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Indirect lending activities\n</td> <td>18,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SBA lending activities\n</td> <td>4,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank owned life insurance\n</td> <td>1,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securities gains\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(189\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>5,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,514\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,558\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest income for 2014 was $95.3 million compared to $96.9 million in 2013, a 1.6% decrease. This decrease was primarily due to a decreases in revenues from mortgage banking and other noninterest income, partially offset by increases in indirect lending activities and SBA lending activities, as described below.\nNoninterest income from indirect lending activities increased to $18.5 million in 2014, compared to $9.0 million in 2013, an increase of 104.2%, primarily due to the increased production from an overall increase in auto sales and expansion into new markets and gain on sale of indirect loans sold with servicing retained. Total indirect loans grew from $1.0 billion in 2013 to $1.4 billion in 2014. In addition to this Indirect loan sales grew from $392.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $679.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. As a result, the associated servicing fee income from the indirect servicing portfolio increased $1.6 million year over year. Also, gain on sales of indirect loans increased by $8.0 million during 2014 to $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIncome from SBA lending activities, including gains from the sale of SBA loans and ancillary fees on SBA loans sold with servicing retained, totaled $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of 37.0% or $1.3 million. This increase occurred primarily due to an increase in production of SBA loans in 2014. Production of SBA loans increased $23.2 million with sales also increasing $15.4 million year over year. Increase in production is attributable to increased focus on lending to franchises and professional practice companies.\nMortgage banking revenues decreased $10.8 million to $55.8 million in 2014, compared to $66.6 million in 2013, a decrease of 16.2%. The decrease was mostly due to a decrease in mortgage loan volume consistent with national trend of declining refinance volume. Mortgage production for the year decreased $551.4 million, or 22% year over year. This resulted in a decrease in the amount of residential mortgage loans sold of $665.8 million, or 29.8% year over year. However, the gain on sale of mortgage loans compared to 2013 decreased only 10.1%, or $4.8 million year over year.\nOther noninterest income decreased by $2.5 million during 2014 to $5.6 million, primarily due to a reduction in gain on sale of ORE of $1.6 million, as the ORE portfolio continued to decline through the disposition of problem assets. In addition, the decrease in noninterest income was partially due to an increase of $910,000 in the amortization of the FDIC Indemnification Asset, as expected cash flows on acquired assets continue to improve.\nNoninterest Expense\nThe categories of noninterest expense, and the dollar and percentage change between the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 are as follows:\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and employee benefits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commissions\n</td> <td>19,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,688\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net occupancy\n</td> <td>12,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Communication\n</td> <td>3,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>34,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,753\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>138,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest expense during 2014 increased $6.4 million, or 4.9%, to $138.8 million when compared to 2013, primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits, and increases in net occupancy expenses, as the number of branches continued to grow in 2014, partially offset by a decline in commissions and other expenses.\nSalaries and benefits expense increased $9.4 million, or 16.2%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to the higher salaries associated with the net addition of 148 full-time equivalent employees during 2014, primarily as a result of opening or acquiring the twelve new branches during the year as well as additional mortgage and SBA locations in 2014 and the associated administrative support functions.\nCommissions decreased by $4.7 million, or 19.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $20.0 million as compared to $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This decrease occurred primarily as a result of the decrease in production in the mortgage division during 2014 as the commissions are a variable expense that is calculated as a percentage of the loan production in the division.\nCommunication and net occupancy expenses increased by $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $16.9 million as compared to $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in net occupancy expense is primarily due to increases in rental expense and depreciation expense year over year. The increase in communication expense is primarily attributable to increases in telephone and postage expenses over the course of the year. Both of these increases are in relation to increase in number of locations.\nOther operating expenses were $34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a $1.8 million, or 4.8%, decrease compared to $36.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 as a result of an overall decrease in ORE expenses, including a reduction of $1.9 million in writedowns of ORE during 2014, as asset quality continues to improve.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe provision for income taxes expense for 2014 and 2013 was $16.4 million and $15.1 million, respectively, with effective tax rates of 35.4% and 35.3%, respectively.\nFinancial Condition\nWe manage our assets and liabilities to maximize long-term earnings opportunities while maintaining the integrity of our financial position and the quality of earnings. To accomplish this objective, management strives for efficient management of interest rate risk and liquidity needs. The primary objectives of interest-sensitivity management are to minimize the effect of interest rate changes on the net interest margin and to manage the exposure to risk while maintaining net interest income at acceptable levels. Liquidity is provided by our attempt to carefully structure our balance sheet as well as through both unsecured and secured lines of credit with other financial institutions, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (the FHLB\u201d), and the FRB.\nThe Asset Liability Management Committee ( ALCO\u201d), which is comprised of various senior executives, meets regularly to review our interest rate sensitivity positions and balance sheet mix; monitor our capital position and ratios; review our product offerings and pricing, including rates, fees and charges; monitor our funding needs and sources; and review cash flows to assess our current and projected liquidity.\nMarket Risk and Interest Rate Sensitivity\nOur primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. We have little or no risk related to trading accounts, commodities, or foreign exchange.\nInterest rate risk, which encompasses price risk, is the exposure of our financial condition and earnings ability to withstand adverse movements in interest rates. Accepting this risk can be an important source of profitability and shareholder value; however, excessive levels of interest rate risk can pose a significant threat to assets, earnings, and capital. Accordingly, effective risk management that maintains interest rate risk at prudent levels is essential to our success.\nALCO monitors and considers methods of managing the rate and sensitivity repricing characteristics of the balance sheet components consistent with maintaining acceptable levels of changes in portfolio values and net interest income with changes in interest rates. The primary purposes of ALCO are to manage our interest rate risk consistent with earnings and liquidity, to effectively invest our capital, and to preserve the value created by our core business operations. In addition, our exposure to interest rate risk is compared to established tolerances on at least a quarterly basis by our Board of Directors.\nEvaluating our exposure to changes in interest rates includes assessing both the adequacy of the process we use to control interest rate risk and our quantitative levels of exposure. When assessing the interest rate risk management process, we seek to ensure that appropriate policies, procedures, management information systems, and internal controls are in place to maintain interest rate risk at prudent levels with consistency and continuity. Evaluating the quantitative level of interest rate risk exposure requires us to assess the existing and potential future effects of changes in interest rates on our consolidated financial condition, including capital adequacy, earnings, liquidity, and, where appropriate, asset quality.\nThe primary tool management uses to estimate and manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates is an asset/liability simulation model. Resulting estimates are based upon a number of assumptions for each scenario, including the level of balance sheet growth, loan and deposit repricing characteristics, and the rate of prepayment. ALCO periodically reviews the assumptions for accuracy based on historical data and future expectations, however, actual net interest income may differ from model results. The primary objective of the simulation model is to measure the potential change in net interest revenue over time\nusing multiple interest rate scenarios. The base scenario assumes the most likely estimate of future interest rate increases and balance sheet changes and is the scenario from which others are compared. Policy limits are based on immediate rate shock scenarios which are compared to the base scenario. While the primary policy scenarios focus on a twelve month time frame, longer time horizons are also modeled. In addition, management reviews the impact of various yield curve scenarios on earnings and cash flows. Our policy states that an immediate and sustained 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates should not negatively impact net interest income by more than 10%.\nWe also use the simulation model to calculate the economic value of equity under various interest rate scenarios. Economic value of equity analysis compares the assumed market value of the Company to a base projection calculating the net change to ensure that market value remains with approved limits under various scenarios.\nThe following table summarizes the results of a 12-month forecasting period of an immediate and sustained increase or decrease of 100 and 200 basis points for market interest rates as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basis Point Change in Interest Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change in Projected\nNet Interest Income\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.63\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-2.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-2.84\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe rate shock analysis at December 31, 2015 indicated that all of the scenarios would fall within policy parameters and approved tolerances for net interest income.\nRate shock analysis provides only a limited, point in time view of interest rate sensitivity. The actual impact of interest rate changes upon earnings and net present value may differ from that implied by any rate shock. In addition, net interest income and net present value under various future interest rate scenarios are affected by multiple other factors not embodied in a rate shock, including competition, changes in the shape of the Treasury yield curve, divergent movement among various interest rate indices, and the speed with which interest rates change.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our financial obligations, which arise primarily from the withdrawal of deposits, extension of credit, scheduled and prepaid loan payments, and payment of operating expenses. The principal demands for liquidity are new loans, anticipated fundings under credit commitments to customers, and deposit withdrawals. Our liabilities provide liquidity on a day-to-day basis. Daily liquidity needs are met from deposit levels or from our use of federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term borrowings. We engage in routine activities to retain deposits intended to enhance our liquidity position. These routine activities include various measures, such as the following:\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers, where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with us;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Pricing deposits, including certificates of deposit, at rate levels that will sustain balances at levels that will enhance our asset liability management and net interest margin requirements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our appeal as a primary provider of financial services.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In addition to monitoring our interest rate sensitivity, ALCO also manages our liquidity risk. We employ our funds in a manner to provide liquidity from both assets and liabilities sufficient to meet our cash needs. Management seeks to maintain a stable net liquidity position while optimizing operating results, as reflected in net interest income, the net yield on earning assets, and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. ALCO meets regularly to review the current and projected net liquidity positions and to review actions taken by management to achieve this liquidity objective. While the desired level of liquidity will vary depending on a number of factors, one of the primary goals of ALCO is to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity in both normal operating conditions and in periods of internal or industry stress.\nOur ongoing philosophy is to remain in a liquid position as reflected by such indicators as the composition of our earning assets, which typically includes some level of federal funds sold, cash balances at the FRB, and/or other short-term investments; asset quality; being in a well-capitalized position; and having profitable operating results. Cyclical and other economic trends and conditions can disrupt the Bank's desired liquidity position at any time. Under such circumstances, our federal funds sold position, or cash balances at the FRB, if any, serve as the primary sources of immediate liquidity.\nIn addition to cash and cash equivalents, our investment securities available-for-sale, and the availability of deposits from brokers, as of December 31, 2015, we had the following sources of available unused liquidity:\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FRB discount window\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>253,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FHLB advances\n</td> <td>251,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unpledged securities\n</td> <td>69,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured federal funds lines\n</td> <td>125,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total sources of available unused liquidity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>699,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available. Our contingency funding plan describes several potential stages based on liquidity levels. Our Board of Directors reviews liquidity benchmarks quarterly. Also, we review on at least an annual basis our liquidity position and our contingency funding plans with our principal banking regulator. We also maintain various wholesale sources of funding and our interest cost would vary based on the range of interest rates charged.\nFSC has limited liquidity, and we rely primarily on interest and dividends from our subsidiaries' equity, the debt and equity markets, interest income, management fees, and dividends from the Bank and LionMark as sources of liquidity. Interest and dividends from subsidiaries ordinarily provide a source of liquidity to a bank holding company. The Bank pays interest to the Company on the Bank's subordinated debt and, when declared, cash dividends on its preferred stock and common stock. Under the regulations of the GDBF, bank dividends may not exceed 50% of the prior year's net earnings without approval from the GDBF. If dividends received from the Bank were reduced or eliminated, our liquidity could be adversely affected.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nThe following schedule provides a summary of our financial commitments to make future payments, primarily to fund loan and other credit obligations, long-term debt, and rental commitments primarily for the lease of various facilities housing our business development, executive administration and operational support functions as of December 31, 2015. Loan commitments, lines of credit, and letters of credit are presented at contractual amounts; however, since many of these commitments are revolving\u201d commitments as discussed below and many are expected to expire unused or partially used, the total amount of these commitments does not necessarily reflect future cash requirements. Payments for borrowings do not include interest. Payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in the underlying contracts.\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Commitment Maturity or Payment Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 Year or\nLess\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than\n1 Year but\nLess Than\n3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 Years or\nMore but\nLess Than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 Years or\nMore\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate, construction and land development loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SBA loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home equity loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential mortgage loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lines of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby letters of credit and bankers acceptances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loan commitments(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>227,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>355,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other borrowings(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>209,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>209,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated debt(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental commitments(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commitments and long-term borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>448,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>201,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>746,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Financial commitments include both secured and unsecured obligations to fund.

These financial instruments, which include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, involve to varying degrees elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The contract or notional amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement we have in particular classes of financial instruments.\nOur exposure to credit loss, in the event of nonperformance by customers for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for recorded loans. Loan commitments and other off-balance sheet exposures are evaluated by the Credit Review department quarterly and reserves are provided for risk as deemed appropriate.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the agreement. Substantially all of our commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding. We minimize our exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures. Thus, we will deny funding a commitment if the borrower's financial condition deteriorates during the commitment period, such that the customer no longer meets the pre-established conditions of lending. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. We evaluate each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the borrower. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties.\nStandby and import letters of credit are commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans or lines of credit to customers. We hold collateral supporting those commitments as deemed necessary.\nLoans\nTotal loans, which includes loans held for investment and loans held-for-sale, at December 31, 2015 increased by $672.5 million or 25.6% over December 31, 2014. The following table summarizes the carrying amount of total loans by loan type.\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

held for investment at December 31, 2015 grew to $2.9 billion, an increase of $643.6 million, or 28.6%, over December 31, 2014. New product offerings within residential mortgage, new loan production offices and expansion into new markets through acquisitions, and an overall increase in automobile sales over the prior year were the main drivers of the growth in loans. Indirect automobile loans increased by $230.2 million or 18.9% and residential mortgage loans increased by $144.0 million or 91.0% over December 31, 2014. Commercial loans increased by $179.1 million or 34.2% over December 31, 2014.\nLoans held-for-sale at December 31, 2015 increased by $28.9 million, or 7.8%, over December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to growth in residential mortgage loans held-for-sale of $52.1 million, or 28.7%, due to an increase in\nproduction primarily as a result of an overall increase in sales and expanding into new markets, as well as acquisitions made during the year. The indirect auto portfolio balance decreased by $25.0 million, or 14.3%, as a result of timing of loan sales.\nThe following table summarizes the scheduled contractual maturity of loans held for investment at December 31, 2015.

We manage and control risk in the loan portfolio through adherence to standards established by the Board of Directors and senior management, combined with a commitment to producing quality assets, monitoring loan performance, developing profitable relationships, and meeting the strategic loan quality and growth targets. Our credit policies establish underwriting standards, place limits on exposures, which include concentrations and commitments, and set other limits or standards as deemed necessary and prudent. Also included in the policy, primarily determined by the amount and type of loan, are various approval levels, ranging from the branch or department level to those that are more centralized.\nWe maintain a diversified portfolio intended to spread risk and reduce exposure to economic downturns, which may occur in different segments of the economy or in particular industries. Industry and loan type diversification is reviewed at least quarterly. Management has taken numerous steps to reduce credit risk in the loan portfolio and to strengthen the credit risk management team and processes. In addition, credit policies are continually reviewed and revised as necessary. Experienced managers are in place, strengthening lending areas and Credit Administration.\nThe provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased to $4.4 million compared to $531,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to organic growth in total loans as credit quality continued to improve. Net charge-offs in 2015 decreased to $3.1 million compared to $6.7 million for 2014, largely due to a decrease in net charge-offs on commercial loans, partially offset by a decrease in construction recoveries. This decrease in construction recoveries was primarily the result of a $1.5 million recovery on one construction lending relationship in 2014. Charge-offs for 2014 included $1.2 million relating to one commercial relationship which was carried as a specific reserve at December 31, 2013. The provision for acquired loans decreased $211,000 in 2015 compared to 2014. This decrease is a function of the continued improvement in market conditions as well as improved cash flows on acquired loans and favorable resolution of acquired assets.\nThe Credit Review Department ( Credit Review\u201d) regularly reports to senior management and the Loan and Discount Committee of the Board of Directors regarding the credit quality of the loan portfolio, as well as trends in the portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Credit Review monitors loan concentrations, production, loan growth, as well as loan quality, and independent from the lending departments, reviews risk ratings and tests credits approved for adherence to our lending standards. Finally, Credit Review also performs ongoing, independent reviews of the risk management process and adequacy of loan documentation. The results of its reviews are reported to the Loan and Discount Committee of the Board of Directors. The consumer collection function is centralized and automated to ensure timely collection of accounts and consistent management of risks associated with delinquent accounts.\nNonperforming Assets\nNonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing, repossessions, and other real estate. Nonaccrual loans are loans on which the interest accruals have been discontinued when it appears that future collection of principal or interest according to the contractual terms may be doubtful. Troubled debt restructured loans are those loans whose terms have been modified, because of economic or legal reasons related to the debtors' financial difficulties and provide a concession to the borrower such as, a reduction in principal, change in terms, or modification of interest rates to below market levels. Repossessions include vehicles and other personal property that have been repossessed as a result of payment defaults.\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2011\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonaccrual loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repossessions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other real estate - non-covered\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other real estate - covered\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of loans past due 90 days or more and\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>still accruing to total loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.04\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.04\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.01\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>repossessions and ORE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.67\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.61\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.78\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.56\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.59\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bank had $22.5 million in troubled debt restructured loans at December 31, 2015, of which $15.4 million were accruing loans and $7.1 million are on nonaccrual and included in nonperforming assets in the table above.\nThe decrease in nonperforming assets of $10.8 million from December 31, 2014, to December 31, 2015, primarily resulted from a decrease in nonaccrual loans and covered ORE, as credit quality continued to improve across all loan portfolios and problem assets continued to be resolved. Our noncovered nonperforming assets decreased $7.1 million, or 13.7%.\nManagement believes it has been proactive in charging down and charging off these nonperforming assets as appropriate. Management's assessment of the overall loan portfolio is that loan quality and performance have improved in recent years. Management is being aggressive in evaluating credit relationships and proactive in addressing problems.\nWhen a loan is classified as nonaccrual, to the extent collection is in question, previously accrued interest is reversed and interest income is reduced by the interest accrued in the current year. If any portion of the accrued interest was accrued in a previous period, accrued interest is reduced and a charge for that amount is made to the allowance for loan losses. For 2015, the gross amount of interest income that would have been recorded on nonaccrual loans, if all such loans had been accruing interest at the original contract rate, was approximately $1.3 million compared to $1.5 million and $1.9 million during 2014 and 2013, respectively. For additional information on nonaccrual loans see Critical Accounting Policies-Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nAs discussed in Critical Accounting Policies-Allowance for Loan Losses,\u201d the allowance for loan losses is established and maintained through provisions charged to operations. Such provisions are based on management's evaluation of the loan portfolio including current economic conditions, loan portfolio concentrations, past loan loss experience, adequacy of underlying collateral, and such other factors which, in management's judgment, deserve consideration in estimating loan losses. Loans are charged off when, in the opinion of management, such loans are deemed to be uncollectable. Subsequently, recoveries are added to the allowance.\nFor all loan categories, historical loan loss experience, adjusted for changes in the risk characteristics of each loan category, current trends, and other factors, is used to determine the level of allowance required. Additional amounts are based on the probable losses of individual impaired loans and the effect of economic conditions on both individual loans and loan categories. Since the provision is based on estimates and subjective judgment, it is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts of losses that may ultimately occur.\nThe allowance for loan losses for the homogeneous pools is based on historical net charge-off rates adjusted for current changes in these trends. Nonperforming and substandard commercial loans with outstanding balances exceeding $50,000, as well as certain other performing loans with greater than normal credit risk characteristics, are not treated as homogeneous pools and are instead individually reviewed for a specific allowance. The specific allowance for these individually reviewed loans is based on a specific loan impairment analysis.\nThe unallocated portion of the allowance reflects a margin for the imprecision inherent in estimates of the range of the probable credit losses.\nAt December 31, 2015, the allowance for loan losses was $26.5 million, or 0.91% of loans, compared to $25.5 million, or 1.13% of loans, at December 31, 2014. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were 0.12% in 2015 compared to 0.33% for 2014.\nThe table below presents the allocated loan loss reserves by loan type as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecrease\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,510\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Covered\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquired, Non-covered\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(127\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total allocated loan loss reserve by loan type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur allowance allocated to commercial loans decreased by $2.5 million during 2015, to $10.5 million compared to $13.0 million during 2014. The decrease is related to an improvement in qualitative factors which directly impact this portfolio and a decrease in specific reserves required on impaired loans, partially offset by an increase in the loan portfolio due to organic growth in the portfolio. There was also a increase of $2.4 million in the allowance on our consumer loan portfolio, and $1.0 million in the allowance on our mortgage loan portfolio. The overall increase in the reserve is primarily due to net growth in our total loan portfolio, excluding acquired loans, which increased $518.4 million compared to December 31, 2014, to $2.7 billion, offset by an improvement in the credit quality of our overall loans.\nAllocation of the Allowance for Loan Losses\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

and provide us with the ability to successfully meet both short-term and long-term liquidity needs. While retail deposits are a primary source of funding and provide a customer base for cross-selling additional products and services, we also emphasize commercial accounts as an opportunity for growth and to meet our business customers' needs. We also utilize brokered deposits as a funding source, although to a lesser degree.\nTotal deposits of $3.2 billion at December 31, 2015 increased by $721.5 million, or 29.4%, compared to December 31, 2014. The overall increase occurred primarily due to the assumption of $365.7 million in interest-bearing deposits as part of our three acquisitions in 2015. Core deposits, which are comprised of noninterest-bearing demand; interest-bearing demand, and savings deposits, increased $521.8 million or 31.3% also increased as a result of our continuing transaction account acquisition initiative, particularly in commercial accounts. Time deposits at December 31, 2015 increased $199.6 million, or 25.3%, which included $134.7 million in acquired time deposits.\nThe following table summarizes average balances and interest rates paid by category for the last three years.\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest-bearing demand deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>674,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>539,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>417,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Demand and money market\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>889,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>722,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>648,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Savings deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>322,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>316,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>317,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>873,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>681,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>719,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total average deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,759,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,259,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,103,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal average deposits for 2015 increased $500.0 million, or 22.1%, over 2014. Average core deposits for 2015 increased $308.6 million, or 19.6%, over 2014, primarily due to growth from the continuing transaction account initiative as well as the above-mentioned acquisitions. Time deposits for 2015 increased $191.4 million, or 28.1%, from 2014, due to the assumed time deposits of $102.5 million through acquisitions in 2015, as well as organic growth through our strategic marketing initiatives. Total average deposits for 2014 increased $156.4 million, or 7.43%, over 2013, with $193.7 million of the increase coming from core deposits. The increase in core deposits was primarily due to the transaction account initiative as well as our customers' preference to retain balances in account types that provide flexibility to easily access their funds if rates rise, due to the continued low market interest rate environment.\nAs a result of our organic branch growth, our acquisitions, and our continuing transaction account initiative, we have shifted our deposit mix toward lower cost core deposits over the last two years, resulting in a decrease of 9 basis points in the average rate on deposits. The decrease in the average rate on deposits was primarily the result of the shift in deposit mix as well as the continued low market interest rate environment.\nThe following table summarizes scheduled maturities for time deposits $100,000 and greater as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months or less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>104,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over three through six months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over six through twelve months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over 12 months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total time deposits $100,000 and greater\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>465,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Rate and Maturity Distribution of Borrowings\nWe use our borrowing capability with the FHLB as our primary funding source for borrowings. We enter into FHLB advances with terms that are consistent with our interest rate risk position at the time we enter into each advance. All FHLB advances mature in less than one year and are collateralized with qualifying residential mortgage, home equity and commercial real estate loans and, from time to time, agency notes or agency mortgage-backed securities.\nWe had $165.0 million and $160.0 million in fixed rate FHLB advances outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, we utilized overnight funding sources of $44.7 million and $131.1 million at December 31, 2015 and\n2014, respectively. The decrease from December 31, 2014 was primarily the result of paydowns of other borrowings using cash received from deposits assumed in various acquisitions during 2015.\nThe interest rate characteristics of our overnight repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and federal funds purchased are presented in the table below:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repurchase agreements at an average period-end rate of 0.16% and 0.17%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FHLB Daily Rate Credit Advance with variable interest of 0.37%\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FHLB Fixed Credit Advances with interest rates ranging from 0.25% to 0.58% and 0.19% to 0.41%, for 2015 and 2014, respectively\n</td> <td>165,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>160,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal Funds Purchased at an average period-end rate of 0.39% and 0.49%\n</td> <td>25,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other borrowings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>291,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSchedule of Short-term Borrowings\nThe following information regarding short-term borrowings for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 pertains to our federal funds purchased, overnight repurchase agreements, and FHLB advances.

The Notes are due May 31, 2030 and bear a fixed rate of interest of 5.875% per year until May 31, 2025. From June 1, 2025 to the maturity date, the interest rate will be a floating rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 363 basis points. The Bank incurred approximately $1.1 million of acquisition costs in connection with the debt issuance. The unamortized balance of debt issuance costs is netted against the aggregate principal amount in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Notes were priced at 100% of their par value. We can call the Notes at their par value in whole or in part on June 1, 2025 or any interest payment date thereafter. The Notes qualify as Tier 2 regulatory capital for the Bank and the Company.\nOn September 8, 2013, we redeemed two series of our trust preferred securities previously issued in 2000 with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $20.5 million.\nOn August 20, 2007, we issued $20.0 million in fixed-floating rate capital securities of Fidelity Southern Statutory Trust III with a liquidation value of $1,000 per security. Interest was fixed at 6.62% for five years and converted to a floating rate, which adjusts quarterly at a rate per annum equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 1.40%, with a rate of 1.91% and1.64% at December 31, 2015 and 2014. The issuance has a final maturity of 30 years, but may be redeemed with regulatory approval at any distribution payment date or at any time upon certain events, such as a change in the regulatory treatment of the trust preferred securities, at the redemption price of 100%.\nOn March 17, 2005, we issued $10.0 million in floating rate capital securities of Fidelity Southern Statutory Trust II with a liquidation value of $1,000 per security. Interest adjusts quarterly at a rate per annum equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 1.89%.with a rate of 2.42% and 2.13% at December 31, 2015 and 2014 . The issuance has a final maturity of 30 years, but may be redeemed at any distribution payment date at the redemption price of 100%.\nOn June 26, 2003, we issued $15.0 million in Floating Rate Capital Securities of Fidelity Southern Statutory Trust I with a liquidation value of $1,000 per security. Interest adjusts quarterly at a rate per annum equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 3.10%. The rates in effect on December 31, 2015 and 2014, was 3.70% and 3.35%. The issuance has a final maturity of 30 years, but may be redeemed at any distribution payment date at the redemption price of 100%.\nThe trust preferred securities were sold in private transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d) and were not registered under the Securities Act. The payments to the holders of trust preferred securities are fully tax deductible.\nThe $45.0 million of trust preferred securities issued by our trust subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, are not consolidated for financial reporting purposes. Thus, the equity investments in the subsidiaries we created to issue the obligations, the obligations themselves, and related dividend income and interest expense are reported on an unconsolidated basis, with the investments in the amount of $1.4 million at December 31, 2015, and 2014, reported as other assets and dividends included as other noninterest income. The obligations, including the amount related to the equity investments along with the Notes, totaled $120.3 million and $46.3 million, at December 31, 2015, and 2014, respectively, and are reported as subordinated debt, net of unamortized issuance costs, with related interest expense reported as interest expense on subordinated debt in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe included the $45.0 million of trust preferred securities in our Tier 1 capital at December 31, 2015 and 2014 as an element of restricted core capital. Restricted core capital elements are subject to an aggregate 25% of Tier 1 capital, net of goodwill limitation, as defined by the regulatory risk-based capital standards for bank holding companies. These standards also require that trust preferred securities be excluded from Tier 1 capital within five years of the maturity of the underlying junior subordinated notes issued. Our first junior subordinated note matures in June 2033.\nShareholders' Equity\nShareholders' equity at December 31, 2015 and 2014, was $301.5 million and $265.0 million, respectively. The $36.5 million increase in shareholders' equity over December 31, 2014 was primarily the result of net income for 2015, partially offset by dividends paid to common shareholders during 2015.\nIn December 2008, as part of the U.S. Treasury's Capital Purchase Program, the U.S. Treasury purchased 48,200 shares of the Company's Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the Preferred Stock\u201d), and a warrant for an aggregate purchase price of $48.2 million in cash. On June 27, 2012, the Treasury sold all of its shares of the Company's Preferred Stock in a public offering as part of a modified Dutch auction process. The Company did not receive any proceeds from this auction.\nOn May 28, 2015, the U.S. Treasury sold its warrant in a private transaction with two unaffiliated third-party investors.\nDuring 2015, we received warrant exercise notices for cash and cashless exercises, resulting in the issuance of 1,487,487 shares of common stock. 1,346,873.41 equivalent shares exercised during 2015 were cashless, resulting in the issuance of 1,140,614 shares of common stock. The cash exercise aggregated $931,354, resulting in the issuance of 346,873 shares of common stock. At December 31, 2015, one investor had a warrant to purchase 1,000,000 shares of our common stock. This warrant expires on December 18, 2018.\nOn June 10, 2013, the Company closed a $69.0 million public offering of common stock. The proceeds from that offering were used to redeem all of the Preferred Stock and two series of the Company's trust preferred securities.\nOn April 3, 2014, we filed a shelf registration with the SEC for up to $100 million of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, or debt securities to be issued from time to time for general corporate purposes which may include funding bank and non-bank subsidiaries, financing business expansion, or refinancing or extending the maturity of debt obligations and investments at the holding company level. As of December 31, 2015, we have not utilized the shelf registration.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2016-02, Leases.\u201d The new standard requires the recognition of assets and liabilities arising from lease transactions on the balance sheet and the disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. Accordingly, a lessee will recognize a lease asset for its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability for the corresponding lease obligation. Both the asset and liability will initially be measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. Subsequent measurement, including the presentation of expenses and cash flows, will depend on the classification of the lease as either a finance or an operating lease. Initial costs directly attributable to negotiating and arranging the lease will be included in the asset. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee can make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset to not recognize an asset and corresponding liability. Lessees will also be required to provide additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures are intended to supplement the amounts recorded in the financial statements and provide additional information about the nature of an organization's leasing activities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. In transition, lessees are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The transition guidance also provides specific guidance for sale and leaseback transactions, build-to-suit leases and amounts previously recognized in accordance with the business combinations guidance for leases. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of this ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.\u201d The new guidance is intended to improve the recognition and measurement of financial instruments by requiring: equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method to be measured at fair value through net income, unless they qualify for the practicability exception for investments that do not\nhave readily determinable fair values; changes in instrument-specific credit risk for financial liabilities that are measured under the fair value option will be recognized in other comprehensive income; and entities will make the assessment of the realizability of a deferred tax asset related to an available-for-sale debt security in combination with other deferred tax assets. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, Business Combinations: Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.\u201d The new guidance eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, an acquirer will recognize a measurement-period adjustment during the period in which it determines the amount of the adjustment, including the effect on earnings of any amounts it would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. We implemented this ASU as of December 31, 2015. The adoption of this ASU did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date\u201d which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim reporting periods therein. The FASB had previously issued ASU 2014-09 in May 2014. The amendments in ASU 2014-09 indicate that entities should recognize revenue to reflect the transfers of goods or services to customers in an amount equal to the consideration the entity receives or expects to receive. Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that period. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of this ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn June 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-10 Technical Corrections and Improvements.\u201d The amendments in this standard clarify the guidance, correct references and make minor improvements affecting a variety of topics. The substantive amendments are effective for entities during annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods therein, and other amendments are effective immediately. The adoption of this ASU did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03 Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,\u201d which amends certain provisions of ASC 835 Interest-Imputation of Interest.\u201d The amendments in this standard simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that these costs be presented as a direct reduction of the related debt liability. The update does not change the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs. Subsequently, the SEC announced that it would not object to the presentation of debt issuance costs for line-of-credit arrangements as other assets. As a result, in June 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15 Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements\u201d to incorporate the SEC's comments in the codification. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption was permitted and we early adopted ASU 2015-03 as of June 30, 2015 on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this ASU resulted in an insignificant balance sheet reclassification of $90,000 between the amounts previously reported as other assets and subordinated debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2014.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02 Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.\u201d The amendments in this standard provide guidance for performing a consolidation analysis and all reporting entities will be within the scope of Topic 810. As a result, the ASU clarifies when limited partnerships and other similar entities will be considered variable interest entities; three of the six criteria for determining if fees paid to a decision maker or service provider represent a variable interest were eliminated; reduces the extent to which related party arrangements cause an entity to be considered a primary beneficiary, and eliminates the deferral of ASU 2009-17 for certain investment funds. The amendments are effective for entities during annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of this ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01 Income Statement-Extraordinary and Unusual Items: Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items.\u201d The new guidance eliminates the concept of an extraordinary item. As a result, an entity will no longer segregate extraordinary items from the results of ordinary operations; separately present an extraordinary item on its income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations; nor disclose income taxes and EPS data applicable to an extraordinary item. The ASU does not affect the reporting and disclosure requirements for an event that is unusual in nature or that occurs infrequently. The amendments are effective for entities during annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim reporting periods therein and those requirements may be applied prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of this ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15 Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.\u201d The amendments in this standard provide guidance about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The\namendments will be effective for public entities during annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim reporting periods therein and those requirements should be applied retrospectively. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of this ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-14 Classification of Certain Government-Guaranteed Mortgage Loans upon Foreclosure.\u201d The amendments in this guidance provide specific guidance on how to classify or measure foreclosed mortgage loans that are government guaranteed. The amendments will be effective for public entities during annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim reporting periods therein and those requirements should be applied retrospectively. The adoption of this ASU did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-11 Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures.\u201d The new guidance requires entities to account for repurchase-to-maturity transactions as secured borrowings, eliminates accounting guidance on linked repurchase financing transactions, and expands disclosure requirements for certain transfers of financial assets that are accounted for as sales and certain transfers accounted for as secured borrowings. The amendments are effective for entities during annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim reporting periods therein. The guidance should be applied by making a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption for any transactions outstanding on the effective date. The adoption of this ASU did not have a significant impact on the our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn January 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-04 Reclassification of Residential Real Estate Collateralized Consumer Mortgage Loans upon Foreclosure.\u201d The amendments clarify when an in substance repossession or foreclosure occurs, such that the loan should be derecognized and real estate property should be recognized. The amendments will be effective for entities during annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim reporting periods therein and those requirements should be applied prospectively. The adoption of this ASU did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther accounting standards that have been issued by the FASB or other standard-settings bodies are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nCONSOLIDATED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, certain consolidated quarterly financial information. This information is derived from unaudited consolidated financial statements that include, in the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments which we consider necessary for a fair presentation of the results for such periods. The results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period. This information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>

levels of changes in portfolio values and net interest income with changes in interest rates. The primary purposes of ALCO are to manage our interest rate risk consistent with earnings and liquidity, to effectively invest our capital, and to preserve the value created by our core business operations. In addition, our exposure to interest rate risk is compared to established tolerances on at least a quarterly basis by our Board of Directors.\nA portion of our profitability, as with most financial institutions, is dependent upon net interest income, which is the difference between the interest we receive on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Our net interest margin is affected by prevailing interest rates, nonperforming assets and competition among financial institutions for loans and deposits.\namendments will be effective for public entities during annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim reporting periods therein and those requirements should be applied retrospectively.

The increase in average interest-bearing deposits was primarily due to an increase of $167.5 million in interest-bearing money market and NOW deposits, and $191.4 million in time deposits, a result of both organic growth and acquisitions. The increase in interest expense in 2015 was primarily attributable to the $2.7 million increase in subordinated debt expense, as a result of the subordinated debt issuance. In addition, interest expense on interest bearing deposits increased $1.6 million, as average balances increased as discussed above.\nWhen a loan is classified as nonaccrual, to the extent collection is in question, previously accrued interest is reversed and interest income is reduced by the interest accrued in the current year. If any portion of the accrued interest was accrued in a previous period, accrued interest is reduced and a charge for that amount is made to the allowance for loan losses. For 2015, the gross amount of interest income that would have been recorded on nonaccrual loans, if all such loans had been accruing interest at the original contract rate, was approximately $1.3 million compared to $1.5 million and $1.9 million during 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2013, was $27.6 million or basic and fully diluted earnings per share of $1.35 and $1.21, respectively. The $2.4 million increase in net income in 2014 compared to 2013 was due primarily to an increase in interest income of $4.1 million, a decrease in provision expense of $4.9 million, and a decrease in interest expense of $2.7 million. Partially offsetting these items was an increase in noninterest expense of $6.4 million. Details of the changes in the various components of net income are discussed below.\nThe decrease in nonperforming assets of $10.8 million from December 31, 2014, to December 31, 2015, primarily resulted from a decrease in nonaccrual loans and covered ORE, as credit quality continued to improve across all loan portfolios and problem assets continued to be resolved. Our noncovered nonperforming assets decreased $7.1 million, or 13.7%.\nIn June 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-10 Technical Corrections and Improvements.\u201d The amendments in this standard clarify the guidance, correct references and make minor improvements affecting a variety of topics. The substantive amendments are effective for entities during annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods therein, and other amendments are effective immediately. The adoption of this ASU did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe account for the discount on loans which do not have a discount materially attributable to credit or revolving type loans by accreting the discount on each individual loan over time using a level yield approach based on the expected cash flows for term loans or on a straight-line basis for revolving loans.

If the cost of a loan is determined to be less than the fair value of similar loans, the impairment is recorded by the establishment of a reserve to reduce the value of the loan.\nStandby and import letters of credit are commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.

The increase was due to increased mortgage loan production. Mortgage production for the year increased from $1.9 billion in 2014 to $2.7 billion in 2015, a $739.2 million, or 38.2%, year over year change. Increased production led to an increase in the total of residential mortgage loans sold, an increase from $1.8 billion in 2014 to $2.5 billion in 2015, a $696.4 million or 39.0% year over year change. Gain on sales of mortgage loans increased $26.7 million or 61.9%, year over year, from $43.1 million in 2014 to $69.8 million in 2015. In addition to the volume increase, we were was able to realize a 17% higher margin on loan sales during 2015. Higher margins were, in part, the result of an increase in the margin charged on all products and in part, the result of a higher percentage of loans sold into GNMA MBS, 23.5% of total sales in 2015 compared to 20.7% in 2014. Loans in GNMA MBS can typically be originated with higher margins compared to other product type originations.\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basis Point Change in Interest Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change in Projected\nNet Interest Income\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.63\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-2.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-2.84\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur ongoing philosophy is to remain in a liquid position as reflected by such indicators as the composition of our earning assets, which typically includes some level of federal funds sold, cash balances at the FRB, and/or other short-term investments; asset quality; being in a well-capitalized position; and having profitable operating results. Cyclical and other economic trends and conditions can disrupt the Bank's desired liquidity position at any time. Under such circumstances, our federal funds sold position, or cash balances at the FRB, if any, serve as the primary sources of immediate liquidity.\nEvaluating our exposure to changes in interest rates includes assessing both the adequacy of the process we use to control interest rate risk and our quantitative levels of exposure. When assessing the interest rate risk management process, we seek to ensure that appropriate policies, procedures, management information systems, and internal controls are in place to maintain interest rate risk at prudent levels with consistency and continuity. Evaluating the quantitative level of interest rate risk exposure requires us to assess the existing and potential future effects of changes in interest rates on our consolidated financial condition, including capital adequacy, earnings, liquidity, and, where appropriate, asset quality.\nThe Credit Review Department ( Credit Review\u201d) regularly reports to senior management and the Loan and Discount Committee of the Board of Directors regarding the credit quality of the loan portfolio, as well as trends in the portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Credit Review monitors loan concentrations, production, loan growth, as well as loan quality, and independent from the lending departments, reviews risk ratings and tests credits approved for adherence to our lending standards. Finally, Credit Review also performs ongoing, independent reviews of the risk management process and adequacy of loan documentation. The results of its reviews are reported to the Loan and Discount Committee of the Board of Directors. The consumer collection function is centralized and automated to ensure timely collection of accounts and consistent management of risks associated with delinquent accounts.\nNoninterest income for 2014 was $95.3 million compared to $96.9 million in 2013, a 1.6% decrease.

servicing rights on indirect auto, SBA, and residential mortgage loans are initially recorded at fair value when the underlying loans are sold with servicing retained. These assets are then amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income. On a monthly basis, these servicing assets are assessed for impairment based on fair value. Management determines fair value by stratifying the servicing portfolio into homogeneous subsets with unique behavior characteristics, converting those characteristics into income and expense streams, adjusting those streams for prepayments, present valuing the adjusted streams, and combining the present values into a total. If the cost basis of any loan stratification tranche is higher than the present value of the tranche, an impairment is recorded through a valuation allowance.\nproduction primarily as a result of an overall increase in sales and expanding into new markets, as well as acquisitions made during the year. The indirect auto portfolio balance decreased by $25.0 million, or 14.3%, as a result of timing of loan sales.\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2011\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Allowance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Allowance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Covered\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquired, non-covered\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSchedule of Short-term Borrowings\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and employee benefits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commissions\n</td> <td>27,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net occupancy\n</td> <td>15,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Communication\n</td> <td>4,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>38,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>138,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAverage Balances, Interest and Yields\nWe derive approximately half of our revenues from noninterest income sources such as service charges on loan and deposit accounts and fees on other services; income from mortgage banking, indirect automobile, and SBA activities; and gains on ORE sales. The majority of this revenue is earned from gains on sales of loans. We retain servicing on the majority of loans sold which generates servicing revenue over the remaining life of the loans sold.\nThe following information regarding short-term borrowings for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 pertains to our federal funds purchased, overnight repurchase agreements, and FHLB advances. Short-term borrowings have a maturity of one year or less.\n (1) Financial commitments include both secured and unsecured obligations to fund. Certain residential construction and acquisition and development commitments relate to revolving\u201d commitments whereby payments are received as individual homes or parcels are sold; therefore, the outstanding balances at any one-time will be less than the total commitment. Construction loan commitments in excess of one year have provisions to convert to term loans at the end of the construction period. \nThe primary tool management uses to estimate and manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates is an asset/liability simulation model. Resulting estimates are based upon a number of assumptions for each scenario, including the level of balance sheet growth, loan and deposit repricing characteristics, and the rate of prepayment. ALCO periodically reviews the assumptions for accuracy based on historical data and future expectations, however, actual net interest income may differ from model results. The primary objective of the simulation model is to measure the potential change in net interest revenue over time\nThe following table summarizes the scheduled contractual maturity of loans held for investment at December 31, 2015. Demand loans, loans having no stated repayment schedule or maturity, and overdraft loans are reported as being due within one year.\nNo less frequently than quarterly, management reviews the status of all loans and pools of loans sold with related capitalized servicing assets to determine if there is any impairment to those assets due to such factors as earlier than estimated repayments or significant prepayments. Any impairment identified in these assets will result in reductions in their carrying values through a valuation allowance and a corresponding increase in operating expenses.\nOur primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. We have little or no risk related to trading accounts, commodities, or foreign exchange.\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3\nWe continue to attract new customer relationships, and talented and experienced bankers to support our growth. The focus in 2016 will be to successfully integrate our recent acquisitions, and on credit quality, revenue growth, expense controls, deposit growth and quality loan growth either organically or through acquisition.\nCredit quality risk in the loan portfolio provides our highest degree of risk. We manage and control risk in the loan portfolio through adherence to standards established by the Board of Directors and senior management, combined with a commitment to producing quality assets, monitoring loan performance, developing profitable relationships, and meeting the strategic loan quality and growth targets. Our credit policies establish underwriting standards, place limits on exposures, which include concentrations and commitments, and set other limits or standards as deemed necessary and prudent. Also included in the policy, primarily determined by the amount and type of loan, are various approval levels, ranging from the branch or department level to those that are more centralized.\nNoninterest expense during 2014 increased $6.4 million, or 4.9%, to $138.8 million when compared to 2013, primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits, and increases in net occupancy expenses, as the number of branches continued to grow in 2014, partially offset by a decline in commissions and other expenses.\nThe table below presents the allocated loan loss reserves by loan type as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n\nWe have accounted for our acquisitions as business combinations. As such, the purchase price is allocated to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Generally accepted accounting principles require the use of fair values in determining the carrying values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, as well as for specific disclosures. The calculation of fair value of loans and foreclosed property acquired in a business combination requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than for the remainder of acquired assets or assumed liabilities.\nInterest expense in 2014 decreased $2.7 million, or 19.6%, to $11.2 million, primarily as the result of a 15 basis point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, net of a $25.9 million, or 1.4%, increase in average interest-bearing liability balances. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities for 2014 was primarily used to fund growth in the indirect automobile loan portfolio at various times throughout the year. The reduction in the cost of interest bearing deposits is due to management's strategy of focusing on lower cost core deposits. Average total interest-bearing deposits increased $35.0 million, or 2.1%, to $1.7 billion during 2014 compared to 2013, while average borrowings decreased $9.1 million, or 4.8%, to $180.9 million. The increase in average total interest-bearing deposits was primarily due to an increase of $73.7 million in interest-bearing money market and NOW deposits. The decrease in interest expense in 2014 was primarily attributable to the $1.6 million decrease in subordinated debt expense, as a result of the Company repaying $21 million of subordinated debt during the third quarter of 2013. In addition to this, interest expense on short-term borrowings had a decrease of $323,000, as rates have declined year over year.\nTaxable-equivalent net interest income was $90.8 million in 2014 compared to $84.0 million in 2013, an increase of $6.9 million, or 8.2%. Average interest-earning assets in 2014 increased $164.8 million to $2.5 billion, a 7.0% increase when compared to 2013. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $25.9 million to $1.9 billion, a 1.4% increase. The net interest margin increased by 4 basis points to 3.62% in 2014 when compared to 2013. The primary components of the net interest margin are described below.\nThe allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans outstanding at the end of 2014 and 2013 was 1.13% and 1.78%, respectively.\nThe interest rate characteristics of our overnight repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and federal funds purchased are presented in the table below:\nCommunication and net occupancy expenses increased by $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $16.9 million as compared to $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in net occupancy expense is primarily due to increases in rental expense and depreciation expense year over year. The increase in communication expense is primarily attributable to increases in telephone and postage expenses over the course of the year. Both of these increases are in relation to increase in number of locations.\nLoans held-for-sale at December 31, 2015 increased by $28.9 million, or 7.8%, over December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to growth in residential mortgage loans held-for-sale of $52.1 million, or 28.7%, due to an increase in\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REVIEW\nA formal review of the allowance for loan losses is prepared quarterly to assess the probable credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio and to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. For purposes of the monthly management review, the loan portfolio is separated by loan type. The level of allowance required for each loan type is determined based upon historical charge-off experience and current economic trends. In addition to homogeneous pools of loans, every commercial, commercial real estate, SBA, and construction loan is assigned a risk rating using established credit policy guidelines. All nonperforming commercial, commercial real estate, SBA, and construction loans and loans deemed to have greater than normal risk characteristics are reviewed monthly by our Credit Review Department to determine the level of additional allowance for loan losses, if any, required to be specifically assigned to these loans.\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, certain consolidated quarterly financial information. This information is derived from unaudited consolidated financial statements that include, in the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments which we consider necessary for a fair presentation of the results for such periods. The results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period. This information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.\nThe categories of noninterest income, and the dollar and percentage change between the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, are as follows:\nOur franchise primarily spans the metropolitan Atlanta market and Jacksonville, Orlando and Sarasota-Bradenton, Florida. We also conduct indirect automobile lending, residential mortgage lending and SBA lending activities in thirteen states.\nDerivative instruments are primarily transacted in the secondary mortgage and institutional dealer markets and priced with observable market assumptions at a mid-market valuation point, with appropriate valuation adjustments for liquidity and credit risk. For purposes of valuation adjustments to our derivative positions, we evaluate liquidity premiums that may be demanded by market participants, as well as the credit risk of our counterparties and our own credit.\nIn addition to cash and cash equivalents, our investment securities available-for-sale, and the availability of deposits from brokers, as of December 31, 2015, we had the following sources of available unused liquidity:\nWe file a consolidated federal income tax return, as well as tax returns in several states. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled. The net deferred tax asset is reviewed at each reporting period to assess the probability of realization of benefits in future periods and whether valuation allowances are appropriate. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded in situations where it is more likely than not\u201d that a deferred tax asset is not realizable. Management has reviewed all evidence, both positive and negative, and concluded that a valuation allowance against any deferred tax asset is not needed at December 31, 2015. The calculation of the income tax provision is complex and requires the use of judgments and estimates in its determination.\nThe Asset Liability Management Committee ( ALCO\u201d), which is comprised of various senior executives, meets regularly to review our interest rate sensitivity positions and balance sheet mix; monitor our capital position and ratios; review our product offerings and pricing, including rates, fees and charges; monitor our funding needs and sources; and review cash flows to assess our current and projected liquidity.\nOn June 26, 2003, we issued $15.0 million in Floating Rate Capital Securities of Fidelity Southern Statutory Trust I with a liquidation value of $1,000 per security. Interest adjusts quarterly at a rate per annum equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 3.10%. The rates in effect on December 31, 2015 and 2014, was 3.70% and 3.35%. The issuance has a final maturity of 30 years, but may be redeemed at any distribution payment date at the redemption price of 100%.\n\n\nThe following table summarizes average balances and interest rates paid by category for the last three years.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-14 Classification of Certain Government-Guaranteed Mortgage Loans upon Foreclosure.\u201d The amendments in this guidance provide specific guidance on how to classify or measure foreclosed mortgage loans that are government guaranteed. The amendments will be effective for public entities during annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim reporting periods therein and those requirements should be applied retrospectively. The adoption of this ASU did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe sell indirect automobile loan pools, residential mortgages and SBA loans with servicing retained. When the contractual servicing fees on loans sold with servicing retained are expected to be more than adequate compensation to a servicer for performing the servicing, a capitalized servicing asset is recognized. When the expected costs to a servicer for performing loan servicing are not expected to adequately compensate a servicer, a capitalized servicing liability is recognized. Servicing assets and servicing liabilities are amortized over the expected lives of the serviced loans utilizing the interest method. Management makes certain estimates and assumptions related to costs to service varying types of loans and pools of loans, the projected lives of loans and pools of loans sold, and discount factors used in calculating the present values of servicing fees projected to be received.\nThe allowance for loan losses is established and maintained through provisions charged to operations. Such provisions are based on management's evaluation of the loan portfolio, including loan portfolio concentrations, current economic conditions, past loan loss experience, adequacy of underlying collateral, and such other factors which, in management's judgment, deserve consideration in estimating loan losses. Loans are charged off when, in the opinion of management, such loans are deemed to be uncollectable. Subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance.\nNet charge-offs on consumer loans increased slightly in 2015 to $3.0 million and continue to comprise the majority of the net charge-offs. However, net charge-offs have decreased as a percentage of the average loans outstanding for this portfolio as indirect auto balances have grown steadily during the past five years.\nThe primary objectives in managing the investment securities portfolio include maintaining a portfolio of high quality investments with competitive returns while providing for pledging and liquidity needs within overall asset and liability management parameters. We maintain a relatively high percentage of the investment securities portfolio as available-for-sale to meet possible liquidity needs related to cash flows, the level of loan production, current interest rate risk strategies and the potential future direction of market interest rate changes. The held-to-maturity investment securities are primarily utilized for pledging as collateral for public deposits.\nInterest Rate and Maturity Distribution of Borrowings\nThe primary financial instruments we carry at fair value are investment securities, interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans ( IRLCs\u201d), derivative instruments, and residential mortgage loans held-for-sale. We also carry certain impaired loans, foreclosed assets and capitalized servicing rights on residential mortgage and SBA loans at fair value.\nThe fair value of residential mortgage loans held-for-sale is based on what secondary markets are currently offering for portfolios with similar characteristics. As such, we classify these loans as Level 2.\nWe also use the simulation model to calculate the economic value of equity under various interest rate scenarios. Economic value of equity analysis compares the assumed market value of the Company to a base projection calculating the net change to ensure that market value remains with approved limits under various scenarios.\nRevenue from ORE operations as well as gains or losses on sales are recorded as a component of noninterest income, net of amounts due to/from the FDIC on ORE covered under loss share agreements. Expenses from ORE operations are recorded as a component of noninterest expense, net of amounts due from the FDIC on ORE covered under loss share agreements.\n\n(2) Includes allowance allocated for commercial loans and SBA loans.\n(1) Percentage of respective loan type to loans.\nResults of Operations - 2015 Compared to 2014\nCommissions decreased by $4.7 million, or 19.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $20.0 million as compared to $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This decrease occurred primarily as a result of the decrease in production in the mortgage division during 2014 as the commissions are a variable expense that is calculated as a percentage of the loan production in the division.\nCredit Quality\nCommissions increased by $7.4 million, or 36.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $27.3 million as compared to $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase occurred primarily as production increased $739 million in the mortgage division during 2015 as the commissions are a variable expense that is calculated as a percentage of the loan production in the division. Total mortgage production is expected to increase in 2016, primarily due to the strength of purchase money mortgages demand in our mortgage production footprint. As such, we expect commissions to increase in 2016 in line with production growth.\nOther noninterest income decreased by $2.5 million during 2014 to $5.6 million, primarily due to a reduction in gain on sale of ORE of $1.6 million, as the ORE portfolio continued to decline through the disposition of problem assets. In addition, the decrease in noninterest income was partially due to an increase of $910,000 in the amortization of the FDIC Indemnification Asset, as expected cash flows on acquired assets continue to improve.\nOther accounting standards that have been issued by the FASB or other standard-settings bodies are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nNoninterest income for 2015 was $127.9 million compared to $95.3 million in 2014, a 34.2% increase. This increase was primarily due to a increases in revenues from mortgage banking, as described below.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNoninterest Expense\nThe provision for income taxes expense for 2015 and 2014 was $22.3 million and $16.4 million, respectively, with effective tax rates of 36.3% and 35.4%, respectively. The primary driver of the change in expense was an increase in the level of pre-tax income. In addition, the effective tax rate increased between periods due to growth in taxable income exceeding growth in permanent difference items.\nThe unallocated portion of the allowance reflects a margin for the imprecision inherent in estimates of the range of the probable credit losses.\nmeasurements). A financial instrument's level within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe following table summarizes loans held for investment at December 31, 2015 with maturity dates after one year and their sensitivity to interest rate changes.\nAt the time of foreclosure or initial possession of collateral, any excess of the loan balance over the fair value of the real estate held as collateral is treated as a charge against the allowance for loan losses, net of amounts covered under loss share agreements with the FDIC. After the transfer to ORE, the fair value, less estimated selling costs, becomes the new cost basis for the ORE. Subsequent declines in the fair value of ORE, net of amounts covered under loss share agreements with the FDIC, below the new cost basis are recognized by a charge to income.\nIncome from SBA lending activities, including gains from the sale of SBA loans and ancillary fees on SBA loans sold with servicing retained, totaled $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of 37.0% or $1.3 million. This increase occurred primarily due to an increase in production of SBA loans in 2014. Production of SBA loans increased $23.2 million with sales also increasing $15.4 million year over year. Increase in production is attributable to increased focus on lending to franchises and professional practice companies.\nCommunication and net occupancy expenses increased by $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $20.2 million as compared to $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in communication expense is primarily attributable to increases in telephone and postage expenses over the course of the year. Both of these increases are in relation to the increase in the number of locations associated with the Bank's strategy of growth and acquisition. The increase in net occupancy expense is primarily due to increases in rental expense and depreciation expense year over year. Net occupancy acquisition related expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled approximately $500,000 relating primarily to computer hardware,\nIn January 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-04 Reclassification of Residential Real Estate Collateralized Consumer Mortgage Loans upon Foreclosure.\u201d The amendments clarify when an in substance repossession or foreclosure occurs, such that the loan should be derecognized and real estate property should be recognized. The amendments will be effective for entities during annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim reporting periods therein and those requirements should be applied prospectively. The adoption of this ASU did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFor all loan categories, historical loan loss experience, adjusted for changes in the risk characteristics of each loan category, current trends, and other factors, is used to determine the level of allowance required. Additional amounts are based on the probable losses of individual impaired loans and the effect of economic conditions on both individual loans and loan categories. Since the provision is based on estimates and subjective judgment, it is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts of losses that may ultimately occur.\nFinancial Performance\nBecause we record acquired loans at fair value, we recorded no allowance for loan losses related to the acquired loans on the acquisition date, given that the fair value of the loans acquired incorporates assumptions regarding credit risk. The fair value estimates associated with the acquired loans include estimates related to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of expected principal, interest and other cash flows.\nTaxable-equivalent net interest income was $101.2 million in 2015 compared to $90.8 million in 2014, an increase of $10.4 million, or 11.5%. Average interest-earning assets in 2015 increased $609.1 million to $3.1 billion, a 24.3% increase when compared to 2014. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $490.1 million to $2.4 billion, a 25.8% increase. The net interest margin decreased by 38 basis points to 3.24% in 2015 when compared to 2014. The primary components of the net interest margin are described below.\nOn September 8, 2013, we redeemed two series of our trust preferred securities previously issued in 2000 with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $20.5 million.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nSubordinated Debt\nWe had $165.0 million and $160.0 million in fixed rate FHLB advances outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, we utilized overnight funding sources of $44.7 million and $131.1 million at December 31, 2015 and\nLiquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our financial obligations, which arise primarily from the withdrawal of deposits, extension of credit, scheduled and prepaid loan payments, and payment of operating expenses. The principal demands for liquidity are new loans, anticipated fundings under credit commitments to customers, and deposit withdrawals. Our liabilities provide liquidity on a day-to-day basis. Daily liquidity needs are met from deposit levels or from our use of federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term borrowings. We engage in routine activities to retain deposits intended to enhance our liquidity position. These routine activities include various measures, such as the following:\nOther operating expenses were $38.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a $3.6 million, or 10.4%, increase compared to $34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of increases associated with acquisitions and new locations. Acquisition related expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled approximately $1.5 million relating to the costs associated with professional fees, conversion, and integration.\nThe provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased to $4.4 million compared to $531,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to organic growth in total loans as credit quality continued to improve. Net charge-offs in 2015 decreased to $3.1 million compared to $6.7 million for 2014, largely due to a decrease in net charge-offs on commercial loans, partially offset by a decrease in construction recoveries. This decrease in construction recoveries was primarily the result of a $1.5 million recovery on one construction lending relationship in 2014. Charge-offs for 2014 included $1.2 million relating to one commercial relationship which was carried as a specific reserve at December 31, 2013. The provision for acquired loans decreased $211,000 in 2015 compared to 2014. This decrease is a function of the continued improvement in market conditions as well as improved cash flows on acquired loans and favorable resolution of acquired assets.\nThe categories of noninterest income, and the dollar and percentage change between the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, are as follows:\n(1) Interest income includes the effects of taxable-equivalent adjustment using a 35% tax rate\nTaxable-equivalent interest income had an increase of $4.1 million for 2014 as compared to 2013. Although the yield on interest-earning assets in 2014 reflected an 11 basis point decrease as compared to 2013, the resulting decrease in interest income was offset by the additional interest income earned during 2014 on the net growth of $164.8 million, or 7.0%, in average interest-earning assets, primarily in our loan portfolio. The average balance of loans outstanding in 2014 increased $174.7 million, or 8.3%, to $2.3 billion when compared to 2013 due to the increased number of loan originations and market expansion, net of loan payoffs and problem loan resolutions. However, consistent with changes in market interest rates, the yield on average loans outstanding for 2014 decreased 20 basis points to 4.24% when compared to 2013, primarily in the indirect automobile component of the consumer loan portfolio. Average interest-bearing deposits held at correspondent banks decreased $14.9 million to $49.2 million to fund loan growth throughout 2014.\nOur allowance allocated to commercial loans decreased by $2.5 million during 2015, to $10.5 million compared to $13.0 million during 2014. The decrease is related to an improvement in qualitative factors which directly impact this portfolio and a decrease in specific reserves required on impaired loans, partially offset by an increase in the loan portfolio due to organic growth in the portfolio. There was also a increase of $2.4 million in the allowance on our consumer loan portfolio, and $1.0 million in the allowance on our mortgage loan portfolio. The overall increase in the reserve is primarily due to net growth in our total loan portfolio, excluding acquired loans, which increased $518.4 million compared to December 31, 2014, to $2.7 billion, offset by an improvement in the credit quality of our overall loans.\nIncome Tax Expense\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nShareholders' Equity\nIn December 2008, as part of the U.S. Treasury's Capital Purchase Program, the U.S. Treasury purchased 48,200 shares of the Company's Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the Preferred Stock\u201d), and a warrant for an aggregate purchase price of $48.2 million in cash. On June 27, 2012, the Treasury sold all of its shares of the Company's Preferred Stock in a public offering as part of a modified Dutch auction process. The Company did not receive any proceeds from this auction.\nMarket Risk and Interest Rate Sensitivity\n \u2022 Pricing deposits, including certificates of deposit, at rate levels that will sustain balances at levels that will enhance our asset liability management and net interest margin requirements; and \nNoninterest Income\nImpaired loans are evaluated and valued at the time the loan is identified as impaired, at the lower of cost or fair value. Fair value is measured based on the value of the collateral securing these loans and is classified as a Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Collateral may include real estate or business assets, including equipment, inventory and accounts receivable. The value of real estate collateral is determined based on an appraisal by qualified licensed appraisers. If significant, the value of business equipment is based on an appraisal by qualified licensed appraisers; otherwise, the equipment's net book value on the business' financial statements is the basis for the value of business equipment. Inventory and accounts receivable collateral are valued based on independent field examiner review or aging reports. Appraised and reported values may be discounted based on management's historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management's expertise and knowledge of the client and client's business. Impaired loans are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly.\n\n\n \u2022 Continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our appeal as a primary provider of financial services.  In addition to monitoring our interest rate sensitivity, ALCO also manages our liquidity risk. We employ our funds in a manner to provide liquidity from both assets and liabilities sufficient to meet our cash needs. Management seeks to maintain a stable net liquidity position while optimizing operating results, as reflected in net interest income, the net yield on earning assets, and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. ALCO meets regularly to review the current and projected net liquidity positions and to review actions taken by management to achieve this liquidity objective. While the desired level of liquidity will vary depending on a number of factors, one of the primary goals of ALCO is to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity in both normal operating conditions and in periods of internal or industry stress.\nOn August 20, 2007, we issued $20.0 million in fixed-floating rate capital securities of Fidelity Southern Statutory Trust III with a liquidation value of $1,000 per security. Interest was fixed at 6.62% for five years and converted to a floating rate, which adjusts quarterly at a rate per annum equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 1.40%, with a rate of 1.91% and1.64% at December 31, 2015 and 2014. The issuance has a final maturity of 30 years, but may be redeemed with regulatory approval at any distribution payment date or at any time upon certain events, such as a change in the regulatory treatment of the trust preferred securities, at the redemption price of 100%.\nThe categories of noninterest expense, and the dollar and percentage change between the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:\nNet Income\nNoninterest income from indirect lending activities increased to $18.5 million in 2014, compared to $9.0 million in 2013, an increase of 104.2%, primarily due to the increased production from an overall increase in auto sales and expansion into new markets and gain on sale of indirect loans sold with servicing retained. Total indirect loans grew from $1.0 billion in 2013 to $1.4 billion in 2014. In addition to this Indirect loan sales grew from $392.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $679.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. As a result, the associated servicing fee income from the indirect servicing portfolio increased $1.6 million year over year. Also, gain on sales of indirect loans increased by $8.0 million during 2014 to $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\n(1) The change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated to the components in proportion to the relationship of the dollar amounts of the change.\nThe following schedule provides a summary of our financial commitments to make future payments, primarily to fund loan and other credit obligations, long-term debt, and rental commitments primarily for the lease of various facilities housing our business development, executive administration and operational support functions as of December 31, 2015. Loan commitments, lines of credit, and letters of credit are presented at contractual amounts; however, since many of these commitments are revolving\u201d commitments as discussed below and many are expected to expire unused or partially used, the total amount of these commitments does not necessarily reflect future cash requirements. Payments for borrowings do not include interest. Payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in the underlying contracts.\nMortgage banking revenues decreased $10.8 million to $55.8 million in 2014, compared to $66.6 million in 2013, a decrease of 16.2%. The decrease was mostly due to a decrease in mortgage loan volume consistent with national trend of declining refinance volume. Mortgage production for the year decreased $551.4 million, or 22% year over year. This resulted in a decrease in the amount of residential mortgage loans sold of $665.8 million, or 29.8% year over year. However, the gain on sale of mortgage loans compared to 2013 decreased only 10.1%, or $4.8 million year over year.\n (5) Purchase obligations include significant contractual obligations under legally enforceable contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable with initial terms greater than one year. The majority of these amounts are primarily related to salary continuation agreements, and routine services, including core processing systems and telecommunications maintenance. \nNonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing, repossessions, and other real estate. Nonaccrual loans are loans on which the interest accruals have been discontinued when it appears that future collection of principal or interest according to the contractual terms may be doubtful. Troubled debt restructured loans are those loans whose terms have been modified, because of economic or legal reasons related to the debtors' financial difficulties and provide a concession to the borrower such as, a reduction in principal, change in terms, or modification of interest rates to below market levels. Repossessions include vehicles and other personal property that have been repossessed as a result of payment defaults.\nOther Real Estate\nThe categories of noninterest expense, and the dollar and percentage change between the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 are as follows:\n\nNet Interest Income/Margin\nSalaries and benefits expense increased $9.4 million, or 16.2%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to the higher salaries associated with the net addition of 148 full-time equivalent employees during 2014, primarily as a result of opening or acquiring the twelve new branches during the year as well as additional mortgage and SBA locations in 2014 and the associated administrative support functions.\nCapitalized Servicing Assets and Liabilities\n \u2022 Emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers, where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with us; \nORE, consisting of properties obtained through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of loans, is initially reported at fair value, determined on the basis of current appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates of value obtained principally from independent sources, adjusted for estimated selling costs. Management also considers other factors, including changed economic conditions since the last appraisal, changes in absorption rates, stale appraisals or imprecision and subjectivity of the appraisal process, length of time the property has been on the market and anticipated sales values, which have resulted in adjustments to the collateral value estimates indicated in certain appraisals.\nOther operating expenses were $34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a $1.8 million, or 4.8%, decrease compared to $36.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 as a result of an overall decrease in ORE expenses, including a reduction of $1.9 million in writedowns of ORE during 2014, as asset quality continues to improve.\n\nManagement believes it has been proactive in charging down and charging off these nonperforming assets as appropriate. Management's assessment of the overall loan portfolio is that loan quality and performance have improved in recent years. Management is being aggressive in evaluating credit relationships and proactive in addressing problems.\nThe following table summarizes the results of a 12-month forecasting period of an immediate and sustained increase or decrease of 100 and 200 basis points for market interest rates as of December 31, 2015.\nSalaries and benefits expense increased $9.9 million, or 14.7%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to the higher salaries associated with the net addition of 208 full-time equivalent employees during 2015, primarily as a result of opening or acquiring the twelve new branches during the year as well as additional mortgage and SBA locations in 2015 and the associated back-office and administrative support functions. Additional mortgage loan production offices are expected to open in 2016, although fewer than 2015, so we expect salaries and benefits to increase in 2016. However, the increase should not be exactly proportional, as we expect to capitalize on economies of scale.\nInterest expense in 2015 increased $4.6 million, or 40.8%, to $15.8 million, primarily as the result of a 7 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and a $490.1 million, or 25.8%, increase in average interest-bearing liability balances. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities for 2015 was due to organic growth, as well as acquisitions of $365.7 million in interest bearing deposits along with the issuance of $75.0 million in subordinated debt in May 2015.\n (4) Leases and other rental agreements typically have renewal options either at predetermined rates or market rates on renewal. \nAcquisition Accounting\nConsolidated quarterly financial information (unaudited) presented above reflects the impact of acquisitions as of and for the periods following the acquisition date.\nLoans\nRate/Volume Analysis\nAt December 31, 2015, the allowance for loan losses was $26.5 million, or 0.91% of loans, compared to $25.5 million, or 1.13% of loans, at December 31, 2014. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were 0.12% in 2015 compared to 0.33% for 2014.\n\nA portion of our profitability, as with most financial institutions, is dependent upon net interest income, which is the difference between the interest we receive on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Our net interest margin is affected by prevailing interest rates, nonperforming assets and competition among financial institutions for loans and deposits.\nIn January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01 Income Statement-Extraordinary and Unusual Items: Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items.\u201d The new guidance eliminates the concept of an extraordinary item. As a result, an entity will no longer segregate extraordinary items from the results of ordinary operations; separately present an extraordinary item on its income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations; nor disclose income taxes and EPS data applicable to an extraordinary item. The ASU does not affect the reporting and disclosure requirements for an event that is unusual in nature or that occurs infrequently. The amendments are effective for entities during annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim reporting periods therein and those requirements may be applied prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of this ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe following management discussion and analysis addresses important factors affecting our results of operations and financial condition as of and for the periods indicated. The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with this review.\nThe provision for loan losses was $531,000 in 2014 and $5.4 million in 2013. Net charge-offs were $6.7 million in 2014, compared to $6.9 million in 2013. The decrease in the provision in 2014, compared to 2013 was primarily due to improved credit quality in the loan portfolio and a decrease in net charge-offs. Average nonperforming assets were $62.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $75.9 million for the same period in 2013, a decrease of $13.9 million or 18.3%.\n\n\nWe believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available. Our contingency funding plan describes several potential stages based on liquidity levels. Our Board of Directors reviews liquidity benchmarks quarterly. Also, we review on at least an annual basis our liquidity position and our contingency funding plans with our principal banking regulator. We also maintain various wholesale sources of funding and our interest cost would vary based on the range of interest rates charged.\n (1) Weighted average yields are calculated on the basis of the carrying value of the security. \n\nTotal average deposits for 2015 increased $500.0 million, or 22.1%, over 2014. Average core deposits for 2015 increased $308.6 million, or 19.6%, over 2014, primarily due to growth from the continuing transaction account initiative as well as the above-mentioned acquisitions. Time deposits for 2015 increased $191.4 million, or 28.1%, from 2014, due to the assumed time deposits of $102.5 million through acquisitions in 2015, as well as organic growth through our strategic marketing initiatives. Total average deposits for 2014 increased $156.4 million, or 7.43%, over 2013, with $193.7 million of the increase coming from core deposits. The increase in core deposits was primarily due to the transaction account initiative as well as our customers' preference to retain balances in account types that provide flexibility to easily access their funds if rates rise, due to the continued low market interest rate environment.\nAnalysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses\nNoninterest Expense\n (3) Subordinated debt is comprised of three trust preferred security issuances and subordinated notes. We have no obligations related to the trust preferred security holders other than to remit periodic interest payments and to remit principal and interest due at maturity. Each trust preferred security provides us with the opportunity to prepay the securities at specified dates from inception at par after designated periods for all issues. \nOn March 17, 2005, we issued $10.0 million in floating rate capital securities of Fidelity Southern Statutory Trust II with a liquidation value of $1,000 per security. Interest adjusts quarterly at a rate per annum equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 1.89%.with a rate of 2.42% and 2.13% at December 31, 2015 and 2014 . The issuance has a final maturity of 30 years, but may be redeemed at any distribution payment date at the redemption price of 100%.\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-11 Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures.\u201d The new guidance requires entities to account for repurchase-to-maturity transactions as secured borrowings, eliminates accounting guidance on linked repurchase financing transactions, and expands disclosure requirements for certain transfers of financial assets that are accounted for as sales and certain transfers accounted for as secured borrowings. The amendments are effective for entities during annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim reporting periods therein. The guidance should be applied by making a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption for any transactions outstanding on the effective date. The adoption of this ASU did not have a significant impact on the our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAs a result of our organic branch growth, our acquisitions, and our continuing transaction account initiative, we have shifted our deposit mix toward lower cost core deposits over the last two years, resulting in a decrease of 9 basis points in the average rate on deposits. The decrease in the average rate on deposits was primarily the result of the shift in deposit mix as well as the continued low market interest rate environment.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information regarding (i) the total dollar amount of interest income from earning assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant average rate; (iii) net interest income; (iv) net interest spread; and (v) net interest margin. The average balances are principally daily averages, and, for loans, include both performing and non-performing balances. Interest income on loans includes the effects of discount accretion on purchased credit impaired ( PCI\u201d) loans acquired in the FDIC-assisted transactions and net deferred loan origination costs accounted for as yield adjustments.\nNoninterest expense during 2015 increased $24.2 million, or 17.4%, to $162.9 million when compared to 2014, primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits, and increases in net occupancy expenses, as the number of branches and mortgage loan production offices continued to grow in 2015.\nShareholders' equity at December 31, 2015 and 2014, was $301.5 million and $265.0 million, respectively. The $36.5 million increase in shareholders' equity over December 31, 2014 was primarily the result of net income for 2015, partially offset by dividends paid to common shareholders during 2015.\nOur exposure to credit loss, in the event of nonperformance by customers for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for recorded loans. Loan commitments and other off-balance sheet exposures are evaluated by the Credit Review department quarterly and reserves are provided for risk as deemed appropriate.\nTotal loans, which includes loans held for investment and loans held-for-sale, at December 31, 2015 increased by $672.5 million or 25.6% over December 31, 2014. The following table summarizes the carrying amount of total loans by loan type.\nInvestment securities held-to-maturity at December 31, 2015 increased $7.0 million, or 95.9%, over December 31, 2014, primarily the result of acquisitions and a transfer from the available-for-sale portfolio. Investment securities held-to-maturity at December 31, 2014 increased $3.3 million, or 81.4%, from December 31, 2013, primarily the result of purchasing a commercial mortgage-backed security associated with a low-income housing project in one of our markets.\nThe following is a summary of our critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on management's estimates, assumptions, and judgments.\nAs discussed in Critical Accounting Policies-Allowance for Loan Losses,\u201d the allowance for loan losses is established and maintained through provisions charged to operations. Such provisions are based on management's evaluation of the loan portfolio including current economic conditions, loan portfolio concentrations, past loan loss experience, adequacy of underlying collateral, and such other factors which, in management's judgment, deserve consideration in estimating loan losses. Loans are charged off when, in the opinion of management, such loans are deemed to be uncollectable. Subsequently, recoveries are added to the allowance.\nDuring 2015, we continued to expand our footprint and customer base with the opening of additional offices in our retail banking, mortgage lending, and indirect automobile lending divisions including the commencement of indirect automobile lending activities in Oklahoma, expansion of mortgage lending activities into North and South Carolina, the expansion of our retail branch network in Georgia and northern and central Florida through acquisitions, and de novo branch openings. Trust and wealth management began operations in July 2014 and continues to grow.\nWe are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers, and to reduce our own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments, which include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, involve to varying degrees elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The contract or notional amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement we have in particular classes of financial instruments.\nInvestment securities available-for-sale at December 31, 2015 increased $22.8 million, or 15.2%, from December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of acquisitions, net of a transfer of $3.2 million to the held-to-maturity portfolio during 2015. Investment securities available for sale at December 31, 2014 decreased $19.3 million, or 9.4%, over December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of normal principal reductions due to paydowns and maturities.\nWe included the $45.0 million of trust preferred securities in our Tier 1 capital at December 31, 2015 and 2014 as an element of restricted core capital. Restricted core capital elements are subject to an aggregate 25% of Tier 1 capital, net of goodwill limitation, as defined by the regulatory risk-based capital standards for bank holding companies. These standards also require that trust preferred securities be excluded from Tier 1 capital within five years of the maturity of the underlying junior subordinated notes issued. Our first junior subordinated note matures in June 2033.\nOn May 28, 2015, the U.S. Treasury sold its warrant in a private transaction with two unaffiliated third-party investors.\nTotal deposits of $3.2 billion at December 31, 2015 increased by $721.5 million, or 29.4%, compared to December 31, 2014. The overall increase occurred primarily due to the assumption of $365.7 million in interest-bearing deposits as part of our three acquisitions in 2015. Core deposits, which are comprised of noninterest-bearing demand; interest-bearing demand, and savings deposits, increased $521.8 million or 31.3% also increased as a result of our continuing transaction account acquisition initiative, particularly in commercial accounts. Time deposits at December 31, 2015 increased $199.6 million, or 25.3%, which included $134.7 million in acquired time deposits.\n\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, Business Combinations: Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.\u201d The new guidance eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, an acquirer will recognize a measurement-period adjustment during the period in which it determines the amount of the adjustment, including the effect on earnings of any amounts it would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. We implemented this ASU as of December 31, 2015. The adoption of this ASU did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLiquidity\n\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nManagement's policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries, net of amounts due from the FDIC under the loss sharing agreements for our past FDIC-assisted transactions.\n\nIncome Taxes\nOur net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $39.1 million and we reported basic and fully diluted earnings per share of $1.77 and $1.64, respectively. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $30.0 million and basic and fully diluted earnings per share were $1.41 and $1.28, respectively. The $9.1 million increase in net income in 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to an increase in interest income of $15.0 million, partially offset by an increase in provision for loan losses expense of $3.8 million, and an increase in interest expense of $4.6 million. In addition, there was an increase in noninterest income of $32.6 million and an increase in noninterest expense of $24.2 million. Details of the changes in the various components of net income are discussed below.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15 Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.\u201d The amendments in this standard provide guidance about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The\n\nThe amortized cost and fair value of investment securities are categorized in the following table by contractual maturity. Securities not due at a single maturity (i.e., mortgage-backed securities) are shown separately.\nOverview\nOn April 3, 2014, we filed a shelf registration with the SEC for up to $100 million of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, or debt securities to be issued from time to time for general corporate purposes which may include funding bank and non-bank subsidiaries, financing business expansion, or refinancing or extending the maturity of debt obligations and investments at the holding company level. As of December 31, 2015, we have not utilized the shelf registration.\n\nWe recorded net income of $39.1 million in 2015 compared to $30.0 million in 2014, an increase of $9.1 million, or 30.3%. Net income per basic and diluted common share were $1.77 and $1.64, respectively, for 2015 and $1.41 and $1.28, respectively, for 2014. The increases of $32.6 million or 34.2% in noninterest income and $10.4 million, or 11.5%, in net interest income were the main factors impacting our earnings growth in 2015. These increases in income were partially offset by increases in noninterest expense in 2015 of $24.2 million or 17.4% and provision expense of $3.8 million.\nResults of Operations - 2014 Compared to 2013\nForeclosed assets are adjusted to fair value upon transfer of the loans to foreclosed assets. Subsequently, foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value less estimated selling costs. Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management's estimation of the value of the collateral. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value, we record the foreclosed asset as nonrecurring Level 2. When an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price, we record the foreclosed asset as nonrecurring Level 3. Appraised and reported values may be discounted based on management's historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management's expertise and knowledge of the client and client's business.\nThe following table summarizes scheduled maturities for time deposits $100,000 and greater as of December 31, 2015.\nThe provision for loan losses was $4.4 million in 2015 and $531,000 in 2014. Net charge-offs were $3.1 million in 2015 as compared to $6.7 million in 2014. The increase in the provision in 2015, compared to 2014 was primarily due to net new loans originated during 2015 even as credit quality continued to improve. Average nonperforming assets were $62.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $75.9 million for the same period in 2014, a decrease of $13.9 million or 18.3%.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date\u201d which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim reporting periods therein. The FASB had previously issued ASU 2014-09 in May 2014. The amendments in ASU 2014-09 indicate that entities should recognize revenue to reflect the transfers of goods or services to customers in an amount equal to the consideration the entity receives or expects to receive. Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that period. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of this ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe use our borrowing capability with the FHLB as our primary funding source for borrowings. We enter into FHLB advances with terms that are consistent with our interest rate risk position at the time we enter into each advance. All FHLB advances mature in less than one year and are collateralized with qualifying residential mortgage, home equity and commercial real estate loans and, from time to time, agency notes or agency mortgage-backed securities.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02 Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.\u201d The amendments in this standard provide guidance for performing a consolidation analysis and all reporting entities will be within the scope of Topic 810. As a result, the ASU clarifies when limited partnerships and other similar entities will be considered variable interest entities; three of the six criteria for determining if fees paid to a decision maker or service provider represent a variable interest were eliminated; reduces the extent to which related party arrangements cause an entity to be considered a primary beneficiary, and eliminates the deferral of ASU 2009-17 for certain investment funds. The amendments are effective for entities during annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of this ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNonperforming Assets\nWe manage our assets and liabilities to maximize long-term earnings opportunities while maintaining the integrity of our financial position and the quality of earnings. To accomplish this objective, management strives for efficient management of interest rate risk and liquidity needs. The primary objectives of interest-sensitivity management are to minimize the effect of interest rate changes on the net interest margin and to manage the exposure to risk while maintaining net interest income at acceptable levels. Liquidity is provided by our attempt to carefully structure our balance sheet as well as through both unsecured and secured lines of credit with other financial institutions, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (the FHLB\u201d), and the FRB.\nSince our inception in 1973, we have pursued managed profitable growth through providing quality financial services. Our overall focus is on building shareholder value. Our mission is to continue growth, improve earnings and increase shareholder value; to treat customers, employees, community and shareholders according to the Golden Rule; and to operate within a culture of strong internal controls.\nThe trust preferred securities were sold in private transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d) and were not registered under the Securities Act. The payments to the holders of trust preferred securities are fully tax deductible.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the agreement. Substantially all of our commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding. We minimize our exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures. Thus, we will deny funding a commitment if the borrower's financial condition deteriorates during the commitment period, such that the customer no longer meets the pre-established conditions of lending. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. We evaluate each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the borrower. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties.\nProvision for Loan Losses\n\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe rate shock analysis at December 31, 2015 indicated that all of the scenarios would fall within policy parameters and approved tolerances for net interest income.\nThe following table outlines the changes in our allowance for losses during the five-year period ended December 31, 2015. \nSignificant judgments and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of ORE. As a result of the significant judgments required in estimating fair value and the variables involved in different methods of disposition, the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates used to determine the fair value of ORE. The period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility.\nWe segregate loans acquired between loans for which there was a discount related, in part, to credit and loans for which there was not a material discount attributable to credit. Subsequent to the acquisition date, decreases in expected cash flows compared to initial estimates on the loans for which there was a credit discount are recognized as impairment through the provision for loan losses. Probable and significant increases in cash flows (in a loan pool where an allowance for acquired loan losses was previously recorded) reduces the remaining allowance for acquired loan losses before recalculating the amount of accretable yield percentage for the loan pool.\n\nManagement reviews the value of ORE on at least a quarterly basis and adjusts the values as appropriate. Generally, a new appraisal is received annually on each ORE property. Any subsequent adjustments to reflect changes in fair value and selling costs are recorded as a component of other noninterest expense or a reduction of any existing valuation allowance on a property by property basis, but not below zero. In response to market conditions and other economic factors, management may utilize liquidation sales as part of its problem asset disposition strategy.\nWe derive approximately half of our revenues from noninterest income sources such as service charges on loan and deposit accounts, fees on other services and income from mortgage banking, indirect automobile, and SBA activities. The majority of the noninterest income earned on these loan portfolios is generated from gains on sales of loans including recognition of loan servicing on the majority of loans sold. The retained servicing generates servicing revenue over the life of the loans sold. The revenue generated from gains on sales of loans and related servicing is partially offset by amortization and possible impairment of the related servicing rights. Servicing rights are amortized in proportion to the estimated future servicing income on the underlying loans sold. Impairment on servicing rights is recorded based on changes in the estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses on the underlying loans sold.\nNoninterest Income\nCONSOLIDATED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)\nTaxable-equivalent interest income had an increase of $15.0 million for 2015 as compared to 2014. Although the yield on interest-earning assets in 2015 reflected a 32 basis point decrease as compared to 2014, interest income increased due to the net growth of $609.1 million, or 24.3%, in average interest-earning assets, primarily in our loan portfolio. The average balance of loans outstanding in 2015 increased $611.6 million, or 26.8%, to $2.9 billion when compared to 2014 due to the increased number of loan originations and market expansion, including $181.3 million in loans acquired, net of loan payoffs and problem loan resolutions. However, consistent with changes in market interest rates, the yield on average loans for 2015 decreased 38 basis points to 3.86% when compared to 2014.\nThe credit risks inherent and evidenced in our past FDIC-assisted transactions resulted in a portion of the loans purchased in those transactions having a credit discount. On the date of acquisition, when the loans had evidence of credit deterioration since their origination and we believed it was probable that we would not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, we refer to the difference between contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected as the non-accretable discount. We estimate expected cash flows at each future reporting date. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows generally result in a provision for loan losses, net of the amount due from the FDIC under the applicable loss share agreement. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and adjusted accretable discount, which has a positive effect on interest income. We have recorded acquired covered loans at fair value, exclusive of the loss share agreements with the FDIC.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03 Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,\u201d which amends certain provisions of ASC 835 Interest-Imputation of Interest.\u201d The amendments in this standard simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that these costs be presented as a direct reduction of the related debt liability. The update does not change the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs. Subsequently, the SEC announced that it would not object to the presentation of debt issuance costs for line-of-credit arrangements as other assets. As a result, in June 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15 Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements\u201d to incorporate the SEC's comments in the codification. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption was permitted and we early adopted ASU 2015-03 as of June 30, 2015 on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this ASU resulted in an insignificant balance sheet reclassification of $90,000 between the amounts previously reported as other assets and subordinated debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2014.\n2014, respectively. The decrease from December 31, 2014 was primarily the result of paydowns of other borrowings using cash received from deposits assumed in various acquisitions during 2015.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nLoans held for investment at December 31, 2015 grew to $2.9 billion, an increase of $643.6 million, or 28.6%, over December 31, 2014. New product offerings within residential mortgage, new loan production offices and expansion into new markets through acquisitions, and an overall increase in automobile sales over the prior year were the main drivers of the growth in loans. Indirect automobile loans increased by $230.2 million or 18.9% and residential mortgage loans increased by $144.0 million or 91.0% over December 31, 2014. Commercial loans increased by $179.1 million or 34.2% over December 31, 2014.\nOur lending activities are significantly influenced by the local economic environments in the markets we serve. We have grown our consumer installment, mortgage, construction and commercial loan portfolios organically and through acquisition as the economy continues to improve. Our loan portfolio is well diversified among consumer, business, and real estate lending. The credit quality of the loans we have originated continues to be strong.\n\nThe $45.0 million of trust preferred securities issued by our trust subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, are not consolidated for financial reporting purposes. Thus, the equity investments in the subsidiaries we created to issue the obligations, the obligations themselves, and related dividend income and interest expense are reported on an unconsolidated basis, with the investments in the amount of $1.4 million at December 31, 2015, and 2014, reported as other assets and dividends included as other noninterest income. The obligations, including the amount related to the equity investments along with the Notes, totaled $120.3 million and $46.3 million, at December 31, 2015, and 2014, respectively, and are reported as subordinated debt, net of unamortized issuance costs, with related interest expense reported as interest expense on subordinated debt in our consolidated financial statements.\nDeposits are a primary source of funding for us and provide us with the ability to successfully meet both short-term and long-term liquidity needs. While retail deposits are a primary source of funding and provide a customer base for cross-selling additional products and services, we also emphasize commercial accounts as an opportunity for growth and to meet our business customers' needs. We also utilize brokered deposits as a funding source, although to a lesser degree.\nOn May 29, 2015, the Bank issued $75.0 million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes (the Notes\u201d). The Notes are due May 31, 2030 and bear a fixed rate of interest of 5.875% per year until May 31, 2025. From June 1, 2025 to the maturity date, the interest rate will be a floating rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 363 basis points. The Bank incurred approximately $1.1 million of acquisition costs in connection with the debt issuance. The unamortized balance of debt issuance costs is netted against the aggregate principal amount in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Notes were priced at 100% of their par value. We can call the Notes at their par value in whole or in part on June 1, 2025 or any interest payment date thereafter. The Notes qualify as Tier 2 regulatory capital for the Bank and the Company.\n(2) Reflects fully taxable equivalent adjustments using a Federal tax rate of 35%.\nThe provision for income taxes expense for 2014 and 2013 was $16.4 million and $15.1 million, respectively, with effective tax rates of 35.4% and 35.3%, respectively.\nOur accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and conform to general practices within the financial services industry. Our financial position and results of operations are affected by management's application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions, and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Different assumptions in the application of these policies, or conditions significantly different from certain assumptions, could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. Our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d Significant accounting policies have been periodically discussed and reviewed with and approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors.\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2016-02, Leases.\u201d The new standard requires the recognition of assets and liabilities arising from lease transactions on the balance sheet and the disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. Accordingly, a lessee will recognize a lease asset for its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability for the corresponding lease obligation. Both the asset and liability will initially be measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. Subsequent measurement, including the presentation of expenses and cash flows, will depend on the classification of the lease as either a finance or an operating lease. Initial costs directly attributable to negotiating and arranging the lease will be included in the asset. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee can make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset to not recognize an asset and corresponding liability. Lessees will also be required to provide additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures are intended to supplement the amounts recorded in the financial statements and provide additional information about the nature of an organization's leasing activities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. In transition, lessees are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The transition guidance also provides specific guidance for sale and leaseback transactions, build-to-suit leases and amounts previously recognized in accordance with the business combinations guidance for leases. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of this ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n (2) Average yields reflect the effect of taxable equivalent adjustments using a 35% tax rate.  Deposits\nCritical Accounting Policies\nDetermining the fair value of assets and liabilities, particularly illiquid assets and liabilities, is a complicated process involving significant judgment regarding estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated fair value. Information regarding our loan discount and core deposit intangible asset may be adjusted as we refine our estimates. Purchase price allocations on completed acquisitions may be modified through the measurement date which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date. If we recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period, the amounts will be reported in the period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Fair value adjustments based on updated estimates could materially affect the goodwill, if any, recorded on the acquisition.\nRate shock analysis provides only a limited, point in time view of interest rate sensitivity. The actual impact of interest rate changes upon earnings and net present value may differ from that implied by any rate shock. In addition, net interest income and net present value under various future interest rate scenarios are affected by multiple other factors not embodied in a rate shock, including competition, changes in the shape of the Treasury yield curve, divergent movement among various interest rate indices, and the speed with which interest rates change.\nIncome Tax Expense\nInterest rate risk, which encompasses price risk, is the exposure of our financial condition and earnings ability to withstand adverse movements in interest rates. Accepting this risk can be an important source of profitability and shareholder value; however, excessive levels of interest rate risk can pose a significant threat to assets, earnings, and capital. Accordingly, effective risk management that maintains interest rate risk at prudent levels is essential to our success.\nNet Income\nusing multiple interest rate scenarios. The base scenario assumes the most likely estimate of future interest rate increases and balance sheet changes and is the scenario from which others are compared. Policy limits are based on immediate rate shock scenarios which are compared to the base scenario. While the primary policy scenarios focus on a twelve month time frame, longer time horizons are also modeled. In addition, management reviews the impact of various yield curve scenarios on earnings and cash flows. Our policy states that an immediate and sustained 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates should not negatively impact net interest income by more than 10%.\nThe allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans outstanding at the end of 2015 and 2014 was 0.91% and 1.13%, respectively. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans outstanding, excluding acquired loans, at the end of 2015 and 2014 was 0.97% and 1.15%, respectively. The improvement in asset quality over the past several years has offset the need for a higher allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans as a result of loan growth.\nNet recoveries on construction loans decreased by $1.1 million during 2015 to $783,000, compared to net recoveries of $1.9 million in 2014. Net recoveries on construction loans were higher during 2014 primarily due to a recovery of $1.5 million on one relationship during 2014.", "item_7_text": "Allocation of the Allowance for Loan Losses\n\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.\u201d The new guidance is intended to improve the recognition and measurement of financial instruments by requiring: equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method to be measured at fair value through net income, unless they qualify for the practicability exception for investments that do not\nFSC has limited liquidity, and we rely primarily on interest and dividends from our subsidiaries' equity, the debt and equity markets, interest income, management fees, and dividends from the Bank and LionMark as sources of liquidity. Interest and dividends from subsidiaries ordinarily provide a source of liquidity to a bank holding company. The Bank pays interest to the Company on the Bank's subordinated debt and, when declared, cash dividends on its preferred stock and common stock. Under the regulations of the GDBF, bank dividends may not exceed 50% of the prior year's net earnings without approval from the GDBF. If dividends received from the Bank were reduced or eliminated, our liquidity could be adversely affected.\nALCO monitors and considers methods of managing the rate and sensitivity repricing characteristics of the balance sheet components consistent with maintaining acceptable levels of changes in portfolio values and net interest income with changes in interest rates. The primary purposes of ALCO are to manage our interest rate risk consistent with earnings and liquidity, to effectively invest our capital, and to preserve the value created by our core business operations. In addition, our exposure to interest rate risk is compared to established tolerances on at least a quarterly basis by our Board of Directors.\nA portion of our profitability, as with most financial institutions, is dependent upon net interest income, which is the difference between the interest we receive on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Our net interest margin is affected by prevailing interest rates, nonperforming assets and competition among financial institutions for loans and deposits.\namendments will be effective for public entities during annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim reporting periods therein and those requirements should be applied retrospectively. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of this ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFinancial Condition\nAverage interest-bearing deposits increased $364.9 million, or 21.2%, to $2.1 billion during 2015 compared to 2014, while average borrowings increased $125.2 million, or 69.2%, to $306.0 million. The increase in average interest-bearing deposits was primarily due to an increase of $167.5 million in interest-bearing money market and NOW deposits, and $191.4 million in time deposits, a result of both organic growth and acquisitions. The increase in interest expense in 2015 was primarily attributable to the $2.7 million increase in subordinated debt expense, as a result of the subordinated debt issuance. In addition, interest expense on interest bearing deposits increased $1.6 million, as average balances increased as discussed above.\nWhen a loan is classified as nonaccrual, to the extent collection is in question, previously accrued interest is reversed and interest income is reduced by the interest accrued in the current year. If any portion of the accrued interest was accrued in a previous period, accrued interest is reduced and a charge for that amount is made to the allowance for loan losses. For 2015, the gross amount of interest income that would have been recorded on nonaccrual loans, if all such loans had been accruing interest at the original contract rate, was approximately $1.3 million compared to $1.5 million and $1.9 million during 2014 and 2013, respectively. For additional information on nonaccrual loans see Critical Accounting Policies-Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d\nThe Bank had $22.5 million in troubled debt restructured loans at December 31, 2015, of which $15.4 million were accruing loans and $7.1 million are on nonaccrual and included in nonperforming assets in the table above.\nOur net income for the year ended December 31, 2014, was $30.0 million or basic and fully diluted earnings per share of $1.41 and $1.28, respectively. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2013, was $27.6 million or basic and fully diluted earnings per share of $1.35 and $1.21, respectively. The $2.4 million increase in net income in 2014 compared to 2013 was due primarily to an increase in interest income of $4.1 million, a decrease in provision expense of $4.9 million, and a decrease in interest expense of $2.7 million. Partially offsetting these items was an increase in noninterest expense of $6.4 million. Details of the changes in the various components of net income are discussed below.\nThe decrease in nonperforming assets of $10.8 million from December 31, 2014, to December 31, 2015, primarily resulted from a decrease in nonaccrual loans and covered ORE, as credit quality continued to improve across all loan portfolios and problem assets continued to be resolved. Our noncovered nonperforming assets decreased $7.1 million, or 13.7%.\nIn June 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-10 Technical Corrections and Improvements.\u201d The amendments in this standard clarify the guidance, correct references and make minor improvements affecting a variety of topics. The substantive amendments are effective for entities during annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods therein, and other amendments are effective immediately. The adoption of this ASU did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe account for the discount on loans which do not have a discount materially attributable to credit or revolving type loans by accreting the discount on each individual loan over time using a level yield approach based on the expected cash flows for term loans or on a straight-line basis for revolving loans. The methodology also considers the remaining fair value discounts recognized upon acquisition associated with purchased non-impaired loans in estimating a general allowance and also includes establishing an ALL for purchased credit-impaired loans that have deteriorated since acquisition.\nSBA and indirect loans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value. Fair value is based on recent trades for similar loan pools as well as offering prices for similar assets provided by buyers in the secondary market. If the cost of a loan is determined to be less than the fair value of similar loans, the impairment is recorded by the establishment of a reserve to reduce the value of the loan.\nStandby and import letters of credit are commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans or lines of credit to customers. We hold collateral supporting those commitments as deemed necessary.\nhave readily determinable fair values; changes in instrument-specific credit risk for financial liabilities that are measured under the fair value option will be recognized in other comprehensive income; and entities will make the assessment of the realizability of a deferred tax asset related to an available-for-sale debt security in combination with other deferred tax assets. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe credit risk associated with the underlying cash flows of instruments carried at fair value was a consideration in estimating the fair value of certain financial instruments. Credit risk was considered in the valuation through a variety of inputs, as applicable, including, the actual default and loss severity of the collateral, and level of subordination. The assumptions used to estimate credit risk incorporated relevant information that a market participant would likely use in valuing an instrument.\nWe maintain a diversified portfolio intended to spread risk and reduce exposure to economic downturns, which may occur in different segments of the economy or in particular industries. Industry and loan type diversification is reviewed at least quarterly. Management has taken numerous steps to reduce credit risk in the loan portfolio and to strengthen the credit risk management team and processes. In addition, credit policies are continually reviewed and revised as necessary. Experienced managers are in place, strengthening lending areas and Credit Administration.\n (2) All borrowings are collateralized with investment grade securities or with pledged real estate loans. \nMortgage banking revenues increased $29.8 million to $85.5 million in 2015, compared to $55.8 million in 2014, an increase of 53.3%. The increase was due to increased mortgage loan production. Mortgage production for the year increased from $1.9 billion in 2014 to $2.7 billion in 2015, a $739.2 million, or 38.2%, year over year change. Increased production led to an increase in the total of residential mortgage loans sold, an increase from $1.8 billion in 2014 to $2.5 billion in 2015, a $696.4 million or 39.0% year over year change. Gain on sales of mortgage loans increased $26.7 million or 61.9%, year over year, from $43.1 million in 2014 to $69.8 million in 2015. In addition to the volume increase, we were was able to realize a 17% higher margin on loan sales during 2015. Higher margins were, in part, the result of an increase in the margin charged on all products and in part, the result of a higher percentage of loans sold into GNMA MBS, 23.5% of total sales in 2015 compared to 20.7% in 2014. Loans in GNMA MBS can typically be originated with higher margins compared to other product type originations.\nOur ongoing philosophy is to remain in a liquid position as reflected by such indicators as the composition of our earning assets, which typically includes some level of federal funds sold, cash balances at the FRB, and/or other short-term investments; asset quality; being in a well-capitalized position; and having profitable operating results. Cyclical and other economic trends and conditions can disrupt the Bank's desired liquidity position at any time. Under such circumstances, our federal funds sold position, or cash balances at the FRB, if any, serve as the primary sources of immediate liquidity.\nEvaluating our exposure to changes in interest rates includes assessing both the adequacy of the process we use to control interest rate risk and our quantitative levels of exposure. When assessing the interest rate risk management process, we seek to ensure that appropriate policies, procedures, management information systems, and internal controls are in place to maintain interest rate risk at prudent levels with consistency and continuity. Evaluating the quantitative level of interest rate risk exposure requires us to assess the existing and potential future effects of changes in interest rates on our consolidated financial condition, including capital adequacy, earnings, liquidity, and, where appropriate, asset quality.\nThe Credit Review Department ( Credit Review\u201d) regularly reports to senior management and the Loan and Discount Committee of the Board of Directors regarding the credit quality of the loan portfolio, as well as trends in the portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Credit Review monitors loan concentrations, production, loan growth, as well as loan quality, and independent from the lending departments, reviews risk ratings and tests credits approved for adherence to our lending standards. Finally, Credit Review also performs ongoing, independent reviews of the risk management process and adequacy of loan documentation. The results of its reviews are reported to the Loan and Discount Committee of the Board of Directors. The consumer collection function is centralized and automated to ensure timely collection of accounts and consistent management of risks associated with delinquent accounts.\nNoninterest income for 2014 was $95.3 million compared to $96.9 million in 2013, a 1.6% decrease. This decrease was primarily due to a decreases in revenues from mortgage banking and other noninterest income, partially offset by increases in indirect lending activities and SBA lending activities, as described below.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nCommercial net charge-offs decreased $4.2 million during 2015 from $5.4 million in 2014 to $1.2 million in 2015, primarily as a result of several large loan charge-offs in the prior year.\nDuring 2015, we received warrant exercise notices for cash and cashless exercises, resulting in the issuance of 1,487,487 shares of common stock. 1,346,873.41 equivalent shares exercised during 2015 were cashless, resulting in the issuance of 1,140,614 shares of common stock. The cash exercise aggregated $931,354, resulting in the issuance of 346,873 shares of common stock. At December 31, 2015, one investor had a warrant to purchase 1,000,000 shares of our common stock. This warrant expires on December 18, 2018.\nequipment, and branch signage, primarily associated with the acquisition of The Bank of Georgia in October 2015. The acquisition related expenditures are capitalized and expensed to depreciation over the estimated useful life. The increase in communication expense is primarily attributable to increases in telephone and postage expenses over the course of the year. Both of these increases are in relation to the increase in the number of locations associated with the Bank's strategy of growth and acquisition.\nOn June 10, 2013, the Company closed a $69.0 million public offering of common stock. The proceeds from that offering were used to redeem all of the Preferred Stock and two series of the Company's trust preferred securities.\nWe classify IRLCs on a gross basis within other liabilities or other assets. The fair value of these commitments, while based on interest rates observable in the market, is highly dependent on the ultimate closing of the loans. These pull-through\u201d rates are based on both our historical data and the current interest rate environment and reflect our best estimate of the likelihood that a commitment will ultimately result in a closed loan. The loan servicing value is also included in the fair value of the IRLCs.\n\nFair Value\nInvestment Securities\nInvestment securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. For these securities, we obtain fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the bond's terms and conditions, among other things. The investments in our portfolio are generally not quoted on an exchange but are actively traded in the secondary institutional markets.\n\nThe allowance for loan losses for the homogeneous pools is based on historical net charge-off rates adjusted for current changes in these trends. Nonperforming and substandard commercial loans with outstanding balances exceeding $50,000, as well as certain other performing loans with greater than normal credit risk characteristics, are not treated as homogeneous pools and are instead individually reviewed for a specific allowance. The specific allowance for these individually reviewed loans is based on a specific loan impairment analysis.\nNet Interest Income/Margin\nCapitalized servicing rights on indirect auto, SBA, and residential mortgage loans are initially recorded at fair value when the underlying loans are sold with servicing retained. These assets are then amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income. On a monthly basis, these servicing assets are assessed for impairment based on fair value. Management determines fair value by stratifying the servicing portfolio into homogeneous subsets with unique behavior characteristics, converting those characteristics into income and expense streams, adjusting those streams for prepayments, present valuing the adjusted streams, and combining the present values into a total. If the cost basis of any loan stratification tranche is higher than the present value of the tranche, an impairment is recorded through a valuation allowance.\nproduction primarily as a result of an overall increase in sales and expanding into new markets, as well as acquisitions made during the year. The indirect auto portfolio balance decreased by $25.0 million, or 14.3%, as a result of timing of loan sales.\nSchedule of Short-term Borrowings\nAverage Balances, Interest and Yields\nWe derive approximately half of our revenues from noninterest income sources such as service charges on loan and deposit accounts and fees on other services; income from mortgage banking, indirect automobile, and SBA activities; and gains on ORE sales. The majority of this revenue is earned from gains on sales of loans. We retain servicing on the majority of loans sold which generates servicing revenue over the remaining life of the loans sold.\nThe following information regarding short-term borrowings for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 pertains to our federal funds purchased, overnight repurchase agreements, and FHLB advances. Short-term borrowings have a maturity of one year or less.\n (1) Financial commitments include both secured and unsecured obligations to fund. Certain residential construction and acquisition and development commitments relate to revolving\u201d commitments whereby payments are received as individual homes or parcels are sold; therefore, the outstanding balances at any one-time will be less than the total commitment. Construction loan commitments in excess of one year have provisions to convert to term loans at the end of the construction period. \nThe primary tool management uses to estimate and manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates is an asset/liability simulation model. Resulting estimates are based upon a number of assumptions for each scenario, including the level of balance sheet growth, loan and deposit repricing characteristics, and the rate of prepayment. ALCO periodically reviews the assumptions for accuracy based on historical data and future expectations, however, actual net interest income may differ from model results. The primary objective of the simulation model is to measure the potential change in net interest revenue over time\nThe following table summarizes the scheduled contractual maturity of loans held for investment at December 31, 2015. Demand loans, loans having no stated repayment schedule or maturity, and overdraft loans are reported as being due within one year.\nNo less frequently than quarterly, management reviews the status of all loans and pools of loans sold with related capitalized servicing assets to determine if there is any impairment to those assets due to such factors as earlier than estimated repayments or significant prepayments. Any impairment identified in these assets will result in reductions in their carrying values through a valuation allowance and a corresponding increase in operating expenses.\nOur primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. We have little or no risk related to trading accounts, commodities, or foreign exchange.\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3\nWe continue to attract new customer relationships, and talented and experienced bankers to support our growth. The focus in 2016 will be to successfully integrate our recent acquisitions, and on credit quality, revenue growth, expense controls, deposit growth and quality loan growth either organically or through acquisition.\nCredit quality risk in the loan portfolio provides our highest degree of risk. We manage and control risk in the loan portfolio through adherence to standards established by the Board of Directors and senior management, combined with a commitment to producing quality assets, monitoring loan performance, developing profitable relationships, and meeting the strategic loan quality and growth targets. Our credit policies establish underwriting standards, place limits on exposures, which include concentrations and commitments, and set other limits or standards as deemed necessary and prudent. Also included in the policy, primarily determined by the amount and type of loan, are various approval levels, ranging from the branch or department level to those that are more centralized.\nNoninterest expense during 2014 increased $6.4 million, or 4.9%, to $138.8 million when compared to 2013, primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits, and increases in net occupancy expenses, as the number of branches continued to grow in 2014, partially offset by a decline in commissions and other expenses.\nThe table below presents the allocated loan loss reserves by loan type as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n\nWe have accounted for our acquisitions as business combinations. As such, the purchase price is allocated to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Generally accepted accounting principles require the use of fair values in determining the carrying values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, as well as for specific disclosures. The calculation of fair value of loans and foreclosed property acquired in a business combination requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than for the remainder of acquired assets or assumed liabilities.\nInterest expense in 2014 decreased $2.7 million, or 19.6%, to $11.2 million, primarily as the result of a 15 basis point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, net of a $25.9 million, or 1.4%, increase in average interest-bearing liability balances. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities for 2014 was primarily used to fund growth in the indirect automobile loan portfolio at various times throughout the year. The reduction in the cost of interest bearing deposits is due to management's strategy of focusing on lower cost core deposits. Average total interest-bearing deposits increased $35.0 million, or 2.1%, to $1.7 billion during 2014 compared to 2013, while average borrowings decreased $9.1 million, or 4.8%, to $180.9 million. The increase in average total interest-bearing deposits was primarily due to an increase of $73.7 million in interest-bearing money market and NOW deposits. The decrease in interest expense in 2014 was primarily attributable to the $1.6 million decrease in subordinated debt expense, as a result of the Company repaying $21 million of subordinated debt during the third quarter of 2013. In addition to this, interest expense on short-term borrowings had a decrease of $323,000, as rates have declined year over year.\nTaxable-equivalent net interest income was $90.8 million in 2014 compared to $84.0 million in 2013, an increase of $6.9 million, or 8.2%. Average interest-earning assets in 2014 increased $164.8 million to $2.5 billion, a 7.0% increase when compared to 2013. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $25.9 million to $1.9 billion, a 1.4% increase. The net interest margin increased by 4 basis points to 3.62% in 2014 when compared to 2013. The primary components of the net interest margin are described below.\nThe allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans outstanding at the end of 2014 and 2013 was 1.13% and 1.78%, respectively.\nThe interest rate characteristics of our overnight repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and federal funds purchased are presented in the table below:\nCommunication and net occupancy expenses increased by $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $16.9 million as compared to $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in net occupancy expense is primarily due to increases in rental expense and depreciation expense year over year. The increase in communication expense is primarily attributable to increases in telephone and postage expenses over the course of the year. Both of these increases are in relation to increase in number of locations.\nLoans held-for-sale at December 31, 2015 increased by $28.9 million, or 7.8%, over December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to growth in residential mortgage loans held-for-sale of $52.1 million, or 28.7%, due to an increase in\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REVIEW\nA formal review of the allowance for loan losses is prepared quarterly to assess the probable credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio and to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. For purposes of the monthly management review, the loan portfolio is separated by loan type. The level of allowance required for each loan type is determined based upon historical charge-off experience and current economic trends. In addition to homogeneous pools of loans, every commercial, commercial real estate, SBA, and construction loan is assigned a risk rating using established credit policy guidelines. All nonperforming commercial, commercial real estate, SBA, and construction loans and loans deemed to have greater than normal risk characteristics are reviewed monthly by our Credit Review Department to determine the level of additional allowance for loan losses, if any, required to be specifically assigned to these loans.\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, certain consolidated quarterly financial information. This information is derived from unaudited consolidated financial statements that include, in the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments which we consider necessary for a fair presentation of the results for such periods. The results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period. This information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.\nThe categories of noninterest income, and the dollar and percentage change between the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, are as follows:\nOur franchise primarily spans the metropolitan Atlanta market and Jacksonville, Orlando and Sarasota-Bradenton, Florida. We also conduct indirect automobile lending, residential mortgage lending and SBA lending activities in thirteen states.\nDerivative instruments are primarily transacted in the secondary mortgage and institutional dealer markets and priced with observable market assumptions at a mid-market valuation point, with appropriate valuation adjustments for liquidity and credit risk. For purposes of valuation adjustments to our derivative positions, we evaluate liquidity premiums that may be demanded by market participants, as well as the credit risk of our counterparties and our own credit.\nIn addition to cash and cash equivalents, our investment securities available-for-sale, and the availability of deposits from brokers, as of December 31, 2015, we had the following sources of available unused liquidity:\nWe file a consolidated federal income tax return, as well as tax returns in several states. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled. The net deferred tax asset is reviewed at each reporting period to assess the probability of realization of benefits in future periods and whether valuation allowances are appropriate. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded in situations where it is more likely than not\u201d that a deferred tax asset is not realizable. Management has reviewed all evidence, both positive and negative, and concluded that a valuation allowance against any deferred tax asset is not needed at December 31, 2015. The calculation of the income tax provision is complex and requires the use of judgments and estimates in its determination.\nThe Asset Liability Management Committee ( ALCO\u201d), which is comprised of various senior executives, meets regularly to review our interest rate sensitivity positions and balance sheet mix; monitor our capital position and ratios; review our product offerings and pricing, including rates, fees and charges; monitor our funding needs and sources; and review cash flows to assess our current and projected liquidity.\nOn June 26, 2003, we issued $15.0 million in Floating Rate Capital Securities of Fidelity Southern Statutory Trust I with a liquidation value of $1,000 per security. Interest adjusts quarterly at a rate per annum equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 3.10%. The rates in effect on December 31, 2015 and 2014, was 3.70% and 3.35%. The issuance has a final maturity of 30 years, but may be redeemed at any distribution payment date at the redemption price of 100%.\n\n\nThe following table summarizes average balances and interest rates paid by category for the last three years.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-14 Classification of Certain Government-Guaranteed Mortgage Loans upon Foreclosure.\u201d The amendments in this guidance provide specific guidance on how to classify or measure foreclosed mortgage loans that are government guaranteed. The amendments will be effective for public entities during annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim reporting periods therein and those requirements should be applied retrospectively. The adoption of this ASU did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe sell indirect automobile loan pools, residential mortgages and SBA loans with servicing retained. When the contractual servicing fees on loans sold with servicing retained are expected to be more than adequate compensation to a servicer for performing the servicing, a capitalized servicing asset is recognized. When the expected costs to a servicer for performing loan servicing are not expected to adequately compensate a servicer, a capitalized servicing liability is recognized. Servicing assets and servicing liabilities are amortized over the expected lives of the serviced loans utilizing the interest method. Management makes certain estimates and assumptions related to costs to service varying types of loans and pools of loans, the projected lives of loans and pools of loans sold, and discount factors used in calculating the present values of servicing fees projected to be received.\nThe allowance for loan losses is established and maintained through provisions charged to operations. Such provisions are based on management's evaluation of the loan portfolio, including loan portfolio concentrations, current economic conditions, past loan loss experience, adequacy of underlying collateral, and such other factors which, in management's judgment, deserve consideration in estimating loan losses. Loans are charged off when, in the opinion of management, such loans are deemed to be uncollectable. Subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance.\nNet charge-offs on consumer loans increased slightly in 2015 to $3.0 million and continue to comprise the majority of the net charge-offs. However, net charge-offs have decreased as a percentage of the average loans outstanding for this portfolio as indirect auto balances have grown steadily during the past five years.\nThe primary objectives in managing the investment securities portfolio include maintaining a portfolio of high quality investments with competitive returns while providing for pledging and liquidity needs within overall asset and liability management parameters. We maintain a relatively high percentage of the investment securities portfolio as available-for-sale to meet possible liquidity needs related to cash flows, the level of loan production, current interest rate risk strategies and the potential future direction of market interest rate changes. The held-to-maturity investment securities are primarily utilized for pledging as collateral for public deposits.\nInterest Rate and Maturity Distribution of Borrowings\nThe primary financial instruments we carry at fair value are investment securities, interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans ( IRLCs\u201d), derivative instruments, and residential mortgage loans held-for-sale. We also carry certain impaired loans, foreclosed assets and capitalized servicing rights on residential mortgage and SBA loans at fair value.\nThe fair value of residential mortgage loans held-for-sale is based on what secondary markets are currently offering for portfolios with similar characteristics. As such, we classify these loans as Level 2.\nWe also use the simulation model to calculate the economic value of equity under various interest rate scenarios. Economic value of equity analysis compares the assumed market value of the Company to a base projection calculating the net change to ensure that market value remains with approved limits under various scenarios.\nRevenue from ORE operations as well as gains or losses on sales are recorded as a component of noninterest income, net of amounts due to/from the FDIC on ORE covered under loss share agreements. Expenses from ORE operations are recorded as a component of noninterest expense, net of amounts due from the FDIC on ORE covered under loss share agreements.\n\n(2) Includes allowance allocated for commercial loans and SBA loans.\n(1) Percentage of respective loan type to loans.\nResults of Operations - 2015 Compared to 2014\nCommissions decreased by $4.7 million, or 19.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $20.0 million as compared to $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This decrease occurred primarily as a result of the decrease in production in the mortgage division during 2014 as the commissions are a variable expense that is calculated as a percentage of the loan production in the division.\nCredit Quality\nCommissions increased by $7.4 million, or 36.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $27.3 million as compared to $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase occurred primarily as production increased $739 million in the mortgage division during 2015 as the commissions are a variable expense that is calculated as a percentage of the loan production in the division. Total mortgage production is expected to increase in 2016, primarily due to the strength of purchase money mortgages demand in our mortgage production footprint. As such, we expect commissions to increase in 2016 in line with production growth.\nOther noninterest income decreased by $2.5 million during 2014 to $5.6 million, primarily due to a reduction in gain on sale of ORE of $1.6 million, as the ORE portfolio continued to decline through the disposition of problem assets. In addition, the decrease in noninterest income was partially due to an increase of $910,000 in the amortization of the FDIC Indemnification Asset, as expected cash flows on acquired assets continue to improve.\nOther accounting standards that have been issued by the FASB or other standard-settings bodies are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nNoninterest income for 2015 was $127.9 million compared to $95.3 million in 2014, a 34.2% increase. This increase was primarily due to a increases in revenues from mortgage banking, as described below.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNoninterest Expense\nThe provision for income taxes expense for 2015 and 2014 was $22.3 million and $16.4 million, respectively, with effective tax rates of 36.3% and 35.4%, respectively. The primary driver of the change in expense was an increase in the level of pre-tax income. In addition, the effective tax rate increased between periods due to growth in taxable income exceeding growth in permanent difference items.\nThe unallocated portion of the allowance reflects a margin for the imprecision inherent in estimates of the range of the probable credit losses.\nmeasurements). A financial instrument's level within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe following table summarizes loans held for investment at December 31, 2015 with maturity dates after one year and their sensitivity to interest rate changes.\nAt the time of foreclosure or initial possession of collateral, any excess of the loan balance over the fair value of the real estate held as collateral is treated as a charge against the allowance for loan losses, net of amounts covered under loss share agreements with the FDIC. After the transfer to ORE, the fair value, less estimated selling costs, becomes the new cost basis for the ORE. Subsequent declines in the fair value of ORE, net of amounts covered under loss share agreements with the FDIC, below the new cost basis are recognized by a charge to income.\nIncome from SBA lending activities, including gains from the sale of SBA loans and ancillary fees on SBA loans sold with servicing retained, totaled $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of 37.0% or $1.3 million. This increase occurred primarily due to an increase in production of SBA loans in 2014. Production of SBA loans increased $23.2 million with sales also increasing $15.4 million year over year. Increase in production is attributable to increased focus on lending to franchises and professional practice companies.\nCommunication and net occupancy expenses increased by $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $20.2 million as compared to $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in communication expense is primarily attributable to increases in telephone and postage expenses over the course of the year. Both of these increases are in relation to the increase in the number of locations associated with the Bank's strategy of growth and acquisition. The increase in net occupancy expense is primarily due to increases in rental expense and depreciation expense year over year. Net occupancy acquisition related expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled approximately $500,000 relating primarily to computer hardware,\nIn January 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-04 Reclassification of Residential Real Estate Collateralized Consumer Mortgage Loans upon Foreclosure.\u201d The amendments clarify when an in substance repossession or foreclosure occurs, such that the loan should be derecognized and real estate property should be recognized. The amendments will be effective for entities during annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim reporting periods therein and those requirements should be applied prospectively. The adoption of this ASU did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFor all loan categories, historical loan loss experience, adjusted for changes in the risk characteristics of each loan category, current trends, and other factors, is used to determine the level of allowance required. Additional amounts are based on the probable losses of individual impaired loans and the effect of economic conditions on both individual loans and loan categories. Since the provision is based on estimates and subjective judgment, it is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts of losses that may ultimately occur.\nFinancial Performance\nBecause we record acquired loans at fair value, we recorded no allowance for loan losses related to the acquired loans on the acquisition date, given that the fair value of the loans acquired incorporates assumptions regarding credit risk. The fair value estimates associated with the acquired loans include estimates related to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of expected principal, interest and other cash flows.\nTaxable-equivalent net interest income was $101.2 million in 2015 compared to $90.8 million in 2014, an increase of $10.4 million, or 11.5%. Average interest-earning assets in 2015 increased $609.1 million to $3.1 billion, a 24.3% increase when compared to 2014. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $490.1 million to $2.4 billion, a 25.8% increase. The net interest margin decreased by 38 basis points to 3.24% in 2015 when compared to 2014. The primary components of the net interest margin are described below.\nOn September 8, 2013, we redeemed two series of our trust preferred securities previously issued in 2000 with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $20.5 million.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nSubordinated Debt\nWe had $165.0 million and $160.0 million in fixed rate FHLB advances outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, we utilized overnight funding sources of $44.7 million and $131.1 million at December 31, 2015 and\nLiquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our financial obligations, which arise primarily from the withdrawal of deposits, extension of credit, scheduled and prepaid loan payments, and payment of operating expenses. The principal demands for liquidity are new loans, anticipated fundings under credit commitments to customers, and deposit withdrawals. Our liabilities provide liquidity on a day-to-day basis. Daily liquidity needs are met from deposit levels or from our use of federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term borrowings. We engage in routine activities to retain deposits intended to enhance our liquidity position. These routine activities include various measures, such as the following:\nOther operating expenses were $38.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a $3.6 million, or 10.4%, increase compared to $34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of increases associated with acquisitions and new locations. Acquisition related expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled approximately $1.5 million relating to the costs associated with professional fees, conversion, and integration.\nThe provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased to $4.4 million compared to $531,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to organic growth in total loans as credit quality continued to improve. Net charge-offs in 2015 decreased to $3.1 million compared to $6.7 million for 2014, largely due to a decrease in net charge-offs on commercial loans, partially offset by a decrease in construction recoveries. This decrease in construction recoveries was primarily the result of a $1.5 million recovery on one construction lending relationship in 2014. Charge-offs for 2014 included $1.2 million relating to one commercial relationship which was carried as a specific reserve at December 31, 2013. The provision for acquired loans decreased $211,000 in 2015 compared to 2014. This decrease is a function of the continued improvement in market conditions as well as improved cash flows on acquired loans and favorable resolution of acquired assets.\nThe categories of noninterest income, and the dollar and percentage change between the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, are as follows:\n(1) Interest income includes the effects of taxable-equivalent adjustment using a 35% tax rate\nTaxable-equivalent interest income had an increase of $4.1 million for 2014 as compared to 2013. Although the yield on interest-earning assets in 2014 reflected an 11 basis point decrease as compared to 2013, the resulting decrease in interest income was offset by the additional interest income earned during 2014 on the net growth of $164.8 million, or 7.0%, in average interest-earning assets, primarily in our loan portfolio. The average balance of loans outstanding in 2014 increased $174.7 million, or 8.3%, to $2.3 billion when compared to 2013 due to the increased number of loan originations and market expansion, net of loan payoffs and problem loan resolutions. However, consistent with changes in market interest rates, the yield on average loans outstanding for 2014 decreased 20 basis points to 4.24% when compared to 2013, primarily in the indirect automobile component of the consumer loan portfolio. Average interest-bearing deposits held at correspondent banks decreased $14.9 million to $49.2 million to fund loan growth throughout 2014.\nOur allowance allocated to commercial loans decreased by $2.5 million during 2015, to $10.5 million compared to $13.0 million during 2014. The decrease is related to an improvement in qualitative factors which directly impact this portfolio and a decrease in specific reserves required on impaired loans, partially offset by an increase in the loan portfolio due to organic growth in the portfolio. There was also a increase of $2.4 million in the allowance on our consumer loan portfolio, and $1.0 million in the allowance on our mortgage loan portfolio. The overall increase in the reserve is primarily due to net growth in our total loan portfolio, excluding acquired loans, which increased $518.4 million compared to December 31, 2014, to $2.7 billion, offset by an improvement in the credit quality of our overall loans.\nIncome Tax Expense\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nShareholders' Equity\nIn December 2008, as part of the U.S. Treasury's Capital Purchase Program, the U.S. Treasury purchased 48,200 shares of the Company's Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the Preferred Stock\u201d), and a warrant for an aggregate purchase price of $48.2 million in cash. On June 27, 2012, the Treasury sold all of its shares of the Company's Preferred Stock in a public offering as part of a modified Dutch auction process. The Company did not receive any proceeds from this auction.\nMarket Risk and Interest Rate Sensitivity\n \u2022 Pricing deposits, including certificates of deposit, at rate levels that will sustain balances at levels that will enhance our asset liability management and net interest margin requirements; and \nNoninterest Income\nImpaired loans are evaluated and valued at the time the loan is identified as impaired, at the lower of cost or fair value. Fair value is measured based on the value of the collateral securing these loans and is classified as a Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Collateral may include real estate or business assets, including equipment, inventory and accounts receivable. The value of real estate collateral is determined based on an appraisal by qualified licensed appraisers. If significant, the value of business equipment is based on an appraisal by qualified licensed appraisers; otherwise, the equipment's net book value on the business' financial statements is the basis for the value of business equipment. Inventory and accounts receivable collateral are valued based on independent field examiner review or aging reports. Appraised and reported values may be discounted based on management's historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management's expertise and knowledge of the client and client's business. Impaired loans are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly.\n\n\n \u2022 Continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our appeal as a primary provider of financial services.  In addition to monitoring our interest rate sensitivity, ALCO also manages our liquidity risk. We employ our funds in a manner to provide liquidity from both assets and liabilities sufficient to meet our cash needs. Management seeks to maintain a stable net liquidity position while optimizing operating results, as reflected in net interest income, the net yield on earning assets, and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. ALCO meets regularly to review the current and projected net liquidity positions and to review actions taken by management to achieve this liquidity objective. While the desired level of liquidity will vary depending on a number of factors, one of the primary goals of ALCO is to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity in both normal operating conditions and in periods of internal or industry stress.\nOn August 20, 2007, we issued $20.0 million in fixed-floating rate capital securities of Fidelity Southern Statutory Trust III with a liquidation value of $1,000 per security. Interest was fixed at 6.62% for five years and converted to a floating rate, which adjusts quarterly at a rate per annum equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 1.40%, with a rate of 1.91% and1.64% at December 31, 2015 and 2014. The issuance has a final maturity of 30 years, but may be redeemed with regulatory approval at any distribution payment date or at any time upon certain events, such as a change in the regulatory treatment of the trust preferred securities, at the redemption price of 100%.\nThe categories of noninterest expense, and the dollar and percentage change between the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:\nNet Income\nNoninterest income from indirect lending activities increased to $18.5 million in 2014, compared to $9.0 million in 2013, an increase of 104.2%, primarily due to the increased production from an overall increase in auto sales and expansion into new markets and gain on sale of indirect loans sold with servicing retained. Total indirect loans grew from $1.0 billion in 2013 to $1.4 billion in 2014. In addition to this Indirect loan sales grew from $392.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $679.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. As a result, the associated servicing fee income from the indirect servicing portfolio increased $1.6 million year over year. Also, gain on sales of indirect loans increased by $8.0 million during 2014 to $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\n(1) The change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated to the components in proportion to the relationship of the dollar amounts of the change.\nThe following schedule provides a summary of our financial commitments to make future payments, primarily to fund loan and other credit obligations, long-term debt, and rental commitments primarily for the lease of various facilities housing our business development, executive administration and operational support functions as of December 31, 2015. Loan commitments, lines of credit, and letters of credit are presented at contractual amounts; however, since many of these commitments are revolving\u201d commitments as discussed below and many are expected to expire unused or partially used, the total amount of these commitments does not necessarily reflect future cash requirements. Payments for borrowings do not include interest. Payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in the underlying contracts.\nMortgage banking revenues decreased $10.8 million to $55.8 million in 2014, compared to $66.6 million in 2013, a decrease of 16.2%. The decrease was mostly due to a decrease in mortgage loan volume consistent with national trend of declining refinance volume. Mortgage production for the year decreased $551.4 million, or 22% year over year. This resulted in a decrease in the amount of residential mortgage loans sold of $665.8 million, or 29.8% year over year. However, the gain on sale of mortgage loans compared to 2013 decreased only 10.1%, or $4.8 million year over year.\n (5) Purchase obligations include significant contractual obligations under legally enforceable contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable with initial terms greater than one year. The majority of these amounts are primarily related to salary continuation agreements, and routine services, including core processing systems and telecommunications maintenance. \nNonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing, repossessions, and other real estate. Nonaccrual loans are loans on which the interest accruals have been discontinued when it appears that future collection of principal or interest according to the contractual terms may be doubtful. Troubled debt restructured loans are those loans whose terms have been modified, because of economic or legal reasons related to the debtors' financial difficulties and provide a concession to the borrower such as, a reduction in principal, change in terms, or modification of interest rates to below market levels. Repossessions include vehicles and other personal property that have been repossessed as a result of payment defaults.\nOther Real Estate\nThe categories of noninterest expense, and the dollar and percentage change between the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 are as follows:\n\nNet Interest Income/Margin\nSalaries and benefits expense increased $9.4 million, or 16.2%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to the higher salaries associated with the net addition of 148 full-time equivalent employees during 2014, primarily as a result of opening or acquiring the twelve new branches during the year as well as additional mortgage and SBA locations in 2014 and the associated administrative support functions.\nCapitalized Servicing Assets and Liabilities\n \u2022 Emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers, where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with us; \nORE, consisting of properties obtained through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of loans, is initially reported at fair value, determined on the basis of current appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates of value obtained principally from independent sources, adjusted for estimated selling costs. Management also considers other factors, including changed economic conditions since the last appraisal, changes in absorption rates, stale appraisals or imprecision and subjectivity of the appraisal process, length of time the property has been on the market and anticipated sales values, which have resulted in adjustments to the collateral value estimates indicated in certain appraisals.\nOther operating expenses were $34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a $1.8 million, or 4.8%, decrease compared to $36.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 as a result of an overall decrease in ORE expenses, including a reduction of $1.9 million in writedowns of ORE during 2014, as asset quality continues to improve.\n\nManagement believes it has been proactive in charging down and charging off these nonperforming assets as appropriate. Management's assessment of the overall loan portfolio is that loan quality and performance have improved in recent years. Management is being aggressive in evaluating credit relationships and proactive in addressing problems.\nThe following table summarizes the results of a 12-month forecasting period of an immediate and sustained increase or decrease of 100 and 200 basis points for market interest rates as of December 31, 2015.\nSalaries and benefits expense increased $9.9 million, or 14.7%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to the higher salaries associated with the net addition of 208 full-time equivalent employees during 2015, primarily as a result of opening or acquiring the twelve new branches during the year as well as additional mortgage and SBA locations in 2015 and the associated back-office and administrative support functions. Additional mortgage loan production offices are expected to open in 2016, although fewer than 2015, so we expect salaries and benefits to increase in 2016. However, the increase should not be exactly proportional, as we expect to capitalize on economies of scale.\nInterest expense in 2015 increased $4.6 million, or 40.8%, to $15.8 million, primarily as the result of a 7 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and a $490.1 million, or 25.8%, increase in average interest-bearing liability balances. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities for 2015 was due to organic growth, as well as acquisitions of $365.7 million in interest bearing deposits along with the issuance of $75.0 million in subordinated debt in May 2015.\n (4) Leases and other rental agreements typically have renewal options either at predetermined rates or market rates on renewal. \nAcquisition Accounting\nConsolidated quarterly financial information (unaudited) presented above reflects the impact of acquisitions as of and for the periods following the acquisition date.\nLoans\nRate/Volume Analysis\nAt December 31, 2015, the allowance for loan losses was $26.5 million, or 0.91% of loans, compared to $25.5 million, or 1.13% of loans, at December 31, 2014. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were 0.12% in 2015 compared to 0.33% for 2014.\n\nA portion of our profitability, as with most financial institutions, is dependent upon net interest income, which is the difference between the interest we receive on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Our net interest margin is affected by prevailing interest rates, nonperforming assets and competition among financial institutions for loans and deposits.\nIn January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01 Income Statement-Extraordinary and Unusual Items: Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items.\u201d The new guidance eliminates the concept of an extraordinary item. As a result, an entity will no longer segregate extraordinary items from the results of ordinary operations; separately present an extraordinary item on its income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations; nor disclose income taxes and EPS data applicable to an extraordinary item. The ASU does not affect the reporting and disclosure requirements for an event that is unusual in nature or that occurs infrequently. The amendments are effective for entities during annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim reporting periods therein and those requirements may be applied prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of this ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe following management discussion and analysis addresses important factors affecting our results of operations and financial condition as of and for the periods indicated. The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with this review.\nThe provision for loan losses was $531,000 in 2014 and $5.4 million in 2013. Net charge-offs were $6.7 million in 2014, compared to $6.9 million in 2013. The decrease in the provision in 2014, compared to 2013 was primarily due to improved credit quality in the loan portfolio and a decrease in net charge-offs. Average nonperforming assets were $62.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $75.9 million for the same period in 2013, a decrease of $13.9 million or 18.3%.\n\n\nWe believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available. Our contingency funding plan describes several potential stages based on liquidity levels. Our Board of Directors reviews liquidity benchmarks quarterly. Also, we review on at least an annual basis our liquidity position and our contingency funding plans with our principal banking regulator. We also maintain various wholesale sources of funding and our interest cost would vary based on the range of interest rates charged.\n (1) Weighted average yields are calculated on the basis of the carrying value of the security. \n\nTotal average deposits for 2015 increased $500.0 million, or 22.1%, over 2014. Average core deposits for 2015 increased $308.6 million, or 19.6%, over 2014, primarily due to growth from the continuing transaction account initiative as well as the above-mentioned acquisitions. Time deposits for 2015 increased $191.4 million, or 28.1%, from 2014, due to the assumed time deposits of $102.5 million through acquisitions in 2015, as well as organic growth through our strategic marketing initiatives. Total average deposits for 2014 increased $156.4 million, or 7.43%, over 2013, with $193.7 million of the increase coming from core deposits. The increase in core deposits was primarily due to the transaction account initiative as well as our customers' preference to retain balances in account types that provide flexibility to easily access their funds if rates rise, due to the continued low market interest rate environment.\nAnalysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses\nNoninterest Expense\n (3) Subordinated debt is comprised of three trust preferred security issuances and subordinated notes. We have no obligations related to the trust preferred security holders other than to remit periodic interest payments and to remit principal and interest due at maturity. Each trust preferred security provides us with the opportunity to prepay the securities at specified dates from inception at par after designated periods for all issues. \nOn March 17, 2005, we issued $10.0 million in floating rate capital securities of Fidelity Southern Statutory Trust II with a liquidation value of $1,000 per security. Interest adjusts quarterly at a rate per annum equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 1.89%.with a rate of 2.42% and 2.13% at December 31, 2015 and 2014 . The issuance has a final maturity of 30 years, but may be redeemed at any distribution payment date at the redemption price of 100%.\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-11 Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures.\u201d The new guidance requires entities to account for repurchase-to-maturity transactions as secured borrowings, eliminates accounting guidance on linked repurchase financing transactions, and expands disclosure requirements for certain transfers of financial assets that are accounted for as sales and certain transfers accounted for as secured borrowings. The amendments are effective for entities during annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim reporting periods therein. The guidance should be applied by making a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption for any transactions outstanding on the effective date. The adoption of this ASU did not have a significant impact on the our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAs a result of our organic branch growth, our acquisitions, and our continuing transaction account initiative, we have shifted our deposit mix toward lower cost core deposits over the last two years, resulting in a decrease of 9 basis points in the average rate on deposits. The decrease in the average rate on deposits was primarily the result of the shift in deposit mix as well as the continued low market interest rate environment.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information regarding (i) the total dollar amount of interest income from earning assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant average rate; (iii) net interest income; (iv) net interest spread; and (v) net interest margin. The average balances are principally daily averages, and, for loans, include both performing and non-performing balances. Interest income on loans includes the effects of discount accretion on purchased credit impaired ( PCI\u201d) loans acquired in the FDIC-assisted transactions and net deferred loan origination costs accounted for as yield adjustments.\nNoninterest expense during 2015 increased $24.2 million, or 17.4%, to $162.9 million when compared to 2014, primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits, and increases in net occupancy expenses, as the number of branches and mortgage loan production offices continued to grow in 2015.\nShareholders' equity at December 31, 2015 and 2014, was $301.5 million and $265.0 million, respectively. The $36.5 million increase in shareholders' equity over December 31, 2014 was primarily the result of net income for 2015, partially offset by dividends paid to common shareholders during 2015.\nOur exposure to credit loss, in the event of nonperformance by customers for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for recorded loans. Loan commitments and other off-balance sheet exposures are evaluated by the Credit Review department quarterly and reserves are provided for risk as deemed appropriate.\nTotal loans, which includes loans held for investment and loans held-for-sale, at December 31, 2015 increased by $672.5 million or 25.6% over December 31, 2014. The following table summarizes the carrying amount of total loans by loan type.\nInvestment securities held-to-maturity at December 31, 2015 increased $7.0 million, or 95.9%, over December 31, 2014, primarily the result of acquisitions and a transfer from the available-for-sale portfolio. Investment securities held-to-maturity at December 31, 2014 increased $3.3 million, or 81.4%, from December 31, 2013, primarily the result of purchasing a commercial mortgage-backed security associated with a low-income housing project in one of our markets.\nThe following is a summary of our critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on management's estimates, assumptions, and judgments.\nAs discussed in Critical Accounting Policies-Allowance for Loan Losses,\u201d the allowance for loan losses is established and maintained through provisions charged to operations. Such provisions are based on management's evaluation of the loan portfolio including current economic conditions, loan portfolio concentrations, past loan loss experience, adequacy of underlying collateral, and such other factors which, in management's judgment, deserve consideration in estimating loan losses. Loans are charged off when, in the opinion of management, such loans are deemed to be uncollectable. Subsequently, recoveries are added to the allowance.\nDuring 2015, we continued to expand our footprint and customer base with the opening of additional offices in our retail banking, mortgage lending, and indirect automobile lending divisions including the commencement of indirect automobile lending activities in Oklahoma, expansion of mortgage lending activities into North and South Carolina, the expansion of our retail branch network in Georgia and northern and central Florida through acquisitions, and de novo branch openings. Trust and wealth management began operations in July 2014 and continues to grow.\nWe are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers, and to reduce our own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments, which include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, involve to varying degrees elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The contract or notional amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement we have in particular classes of financial instruments.\nInvestment securities available-for-sale at December 31, 2015 increased $22.8 million, or 15.2%, from December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of acquisitions, net of a transfer of $3.2 million to the held-to-maturity portfolio during 2015. Investment securities available for sale at December 31, 2014 decreased $19.3 million, or 9.4%, over December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of normal principal reductions due to paydowns and maturities.\nWe included the $45.0 million of trust preferred securities in our Tier 1 capital at December 31, 2015 and 2014 as an element of restricted core capital. Restricted core capital elements are subject to an aggregate 25% of Tier 1 capital, net of goodwill limitation, as defined by the regulatory risk-based capital standards for bank holding companies. These standards also require that trust preferred securities be excluded from Tier 1 capital within five years of the maturity of the underlying junior subordinated notes issued. Our first junior subordinated note matures in June 2033.\nOn May 28, 2015, the U.S. Treasury sold its warrant in a private transaction with two unaffiliated third-party investors.\nTotal deposits of $3.2 billion at December 31, 2015 increased by $721.5 million, or 29.4%, compared to December 31, 2014. The overall increase occurred primarily due to the assumption of $365.7 million in interest-bearing deposits as part of our three acquisitions in 2015. Core deposits, which are comprised of noninterest-bearing demand; interest-bearing demand, and savings deposits, increased $521.8 million or 31.3% also increased as a result of our continuing transaction account acquisition initiative, particularly in commercial accounts. Time deposits at December 31, 2015 increased $199.6 million, or 25.3%, which included $134.7 million in acquired time deposits.\n\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, Business Combinations: Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.\u201d The new guidance eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, an acquirer will recognize a measurement-period adjustment during the period in which it determines the amount of the adjustment, including the effect on earnings of any amounts it would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. We implemented this ASU as of December 31, 2015. The adoption of this ASU did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLiquidity\n\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nManagement's policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries, net of amounts due from the FDIC under the loss sharing agreements for our past FDIC-assisted transactions.\n\nIncome Taxes\nOur net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $39.1 million and we reported basic and fully diluted earnings per share of $1.77 and $1.64, respectively. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $30.0 million and basic and fully diluted earnings per share were $1.41 and $1.28, respectively. The $9.1 million increase in net income in 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to an increase in interest income of $15.0 million, partially offset by an increase in provision for loan losses expense of $3.8 million, and an increase in interest expense of $4.6 million. In addition, there was an increase in noninterest income of $32.6 million and an increase in noninterest expense of $24.2 million. Details of the changes in the various components of net income are discussed below.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15 Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.\u201d The amendments in this standard provide guidance about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The\n\nThe amortized cost and fair value of investment securities are categorized in the following table by contractual maturity. Securities not due at a single maturity (i.e., mortgage-backed securities) are shown separately.\nOverview\nOn April 3, 2014, we filed a shelf registration with the SEC for up to $100 million of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, or debt securities to be issued from time to time for general corporate purposes which may include funding bank and non-bank subsidiaries, financing business expansion, or refinancing or extending the maturity of debt obligations and investments at the holding company level. As of December 31, 2015, we have not utilized the shelf registration.\n\nWe recorded net income of $39.1 million in 2015 compared to $30.0 million in 2014, an increase of $9.1 million, or 30.3%. Net income per basic and diluted common share were $1.77 and $1.64, respectively, for 2015 and $1.41 and $1.28, respectively, for 2014. The increases of $32.6 million or 34.2% in noninterest income and $10.4 million, or 11.5%, in net interest income were the main factors impacting our earnings growth in 2015. These increases in income were partially offset by increases in noninterest expense in 2015 of $24.2 million or 17.4% and provision expense of $3.8 million.\nResults of Operations - 2014 Compared to 2013\nForeclosed assets are adjusted to fair value upon transfer of the loans to foreclosed assets. Subsequently, foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value less estimated selling costs. Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management's estimation of the value of the collateral. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value, we record the foreclosed asset as nonrecurring Level 2. When an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price, we record the foreclosed asset as nonrecurring Level 3. Appraised and reported values may be discounted based on management's historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management's expertise and knowledge of the client and client's business.\nThe following table summarizes scheduled maturities for time deposits $100,000 and greater as of December 31, 2015.\nThe provision for loan losses was $4.4 million in 2015 and $531,000 in 2014. Net charge-offs were $3.1 million in 2015 as compared to $6.7 million in 2014. The increase in the provision in 2015, compared to 2014 was primarily due to net new loans originated during 2015 even as credit quality continued to improve. Average nonperforming assets were $62.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $75.9 million for the same period in 2014, a decrease of $13.9 million or 18.3%.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date\u201d which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim reporting periods therein. The FASB had previously issued ASU 2014-09 in May 2014. The amendments in ASU 2014-09 indicate that entities should recognize revenue to reflect the transfers of goods or services to customers in an amount equal to the consideration the entity receives or expects to receive. Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that period. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of this ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe use our borrowing capability with the FHLB as our primary funding source for borrowings. We enter into FHLB advances with terms that are consistent with our interest rate risk position at the time we enter into each advance. All FHLB advances mature in less than one year and are collateralized with qualifying residential mortgage, home equity and commercial real estate loans and, from time to time, agency notes or agency mortgage-backed securities.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02 Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.\u201d The amendments in this standard provide guidance for performing a consolidation analysis and all reporting entities will be within the scope of Topic 810. As a result, the ASU clarifies when limited partnerships and other similar entities will be considered variable interest entities; three of the six criteria for determining if fees paid to a decision maker or service provider represent a variable interest were eliminated; reduces the extent to which related party arrangements cause an entity to be considered a primary beneficiary, and eliminates the deferral of ASU 2009-17 for certain investment funds. The amendments are effective for entities during annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of this ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNonperforming Assets\nWe manage our assets and liabilities to maximize long-term earnings opportunities while maintaining the integrity of our financial position and the quality of earnings. To accomplish this objective, management strives for efficient management of interest rate risk and liquidity needs. The primary objectives of interest-sensitivity management are to minimize the effect of interest rate changes on the net interest margin and to manage the exposure to risk while maintaining net interest income at acceptable levels. Liquidity is provided by our attempt to carefully structure our balance sheet as well as through both unsecured and secured lines of credit with other financial institutions, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (the FHLB\u201d), and the FRB.\nSince our inception in 1973, we have pursued managed profitable growth through providing quality financial services. Our overall focus is on building shareholder value. Our mission is to continue growth, improve earnings and increase shareholder value; to treat customers, employees, community and shareholders according to the Golden Rule; and to operate within a culture of strong internal controls.\nThe trust preferred securities were sold in private transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d) and were not registered under the Securities Act. The payments to the holders of trust preferred securities are fully tax deductible.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the agreement. Substantially all of our commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding. We minimize our exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures. Thus, we will deny funding a commitment if the borrower's financial condition deteriorates during the commitment period, such that the customer no longer meets the pre-established conditions of lending. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. We evaluate each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the borrower. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties.\nProvision for Loan Losses\n\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe rate shock analysis at December 31, 2015 indicated that all of the scenarios would fall within policy parameters and approved tolerances for net interest income.\nThe following table outlines the changes in our allowance for losses during the five-year period ended December 31, 2015. \nSignificant judgments and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of ORE. As a result of the significant judgments required in estimating fair value and the variables involved in different methods of disposition, the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates used to determine the fair value of ORE. The period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility.\nWe segregate loans acquired between loans for which there was a discount related, in part, to credit and loans for which there was not a material discount attributable to credit. Subsequent to the acquisition date, decreases in expected cash flows compared to initial estimates on the loans for which there was a credit discount are recognized as impairment through the provision for loan losses. Probable and significant increases in cash flows (in a loan pool where an allowance for acquired loan losses was previously recorded) reduces the remaining allowance for acquired loan losses before recalculating the amount of accretable yield percentage for the loan pool.\n\nManagement reviews the value of ORE on at least a quarterly basis and adjusts the values as appropriate. Generally, a new appraisal is received annually on each ORE property. Any subsequent adjustments to reflect changes in fair value and selling costs are recorded as a component of other noninterest expense or a reduction of any existing valuation allowance on a property by property basis, but not below zero. In response to market conditions and other economic factors, management may utilize liquidation sales as part of its problem asset disposition strategy.\nWe derive approximately half of our revenues from noninterest income sources such as service charges on loan and deposit accounts, fees on other services and income from mortgage banking, indirect automobile, and SBA activities. The majority of the noninterest income earned on these loan portfolios is generated from gains on sales of loans including recognition of loan servicing on the majority of loans sold. The retained servicing generates servicing revenue over the life of the loans sold. The revenue generated from gains on sales of loans and related servicing is partially offset by amortization and possible impairment of the related servicing rights. Servicing rights are amortized in proportion to the estimated future servicing income on the underlying loans sold. Impairment on servicing rights is recorded based on changes in the estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses on the underlying loans sold.\nNoninterest Income\nCONSOLIDATED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)\nTaxable-equivalent interest income had an increase of $15.0 million for 2015 as compared to 2014. Although the yield on interest-earning assets in 2015 reflected a 32 basis point decrease as compared to 2014, interest income increased due to the net growth of $609.1 million, or 24.3%, in average interest-earning assets, primarily in our loan portfolio. The average balance of loans outstanding in 2015 increased $611.6 million, or 26.8%, to $2.9 billion when compared to 2014 due to the increased number of loan originations and market expansion, including $181.3 million in loans acquired, net of loan payoffs and problem loan resolutions. However, consistent with changes in market interest rates, the yield on average loans for 2015 decreased 38 basis points to 3.86% when compared to 2014.\nThe credit risks inherent and evidenced in our past FDIC-assisted transactions resulted in a portion of the loans purchased in those transactions having a credit discount. On the date of acquisition, when the loans had evidence of credit deterioration since their origination and we believed it was probable that we would not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, we refer to the difference between contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected as the non-accretable discount. We estimate expected cash flows at each future reporting date. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows generally result in a provision for loan losses, net of the amount due from the FDIC under the applicable loss share agreement. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and adjusted accretable discount, which has a positive effect on interest income. We have recorded acquired covered loans at fair value, exclusive of the loss share agreements with the FDIC.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03 Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,\u201d which amends certain provisions of ASC 835 Interest-Imputation of Interest.\u201d The amendments in this standard simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that these costs be presented as a direct reduction of the related debt liability. The update does not change the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs. Subsequently, the SEC announced that it would not object to the presentation of debt issuance costs for line-of-credit arrangements as other assets. As a result, in June 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15 Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements\u201d to incorporate the SEC's comments in the codification. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption was permitted and we early adopted ASU 2015-03 as of June 30, 2015 on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this ASU resulted in an insignificant balance sheet reclassification of $90,000 between the amounts previously reported as other assets and subordinated debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2014.\n2014, respectively. The decrease from December 31, 2014 was primarily the result of paydowns of other borrowings using cash received from deposits assumed in various acquisitions during 2015.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nLoans held for investment at December 31, 2015 grew to $2.9 billion, an increase of $643.6 million, or 28.6%, over December 31, 2014. New product offerings within residential mortgage, new loan production offices and expansion into new markets through acquisitions, and an overall increase in automobile sales over the prior year were the main drivers of the growth in loans. Indirect automobile loans increased by $230.2 million or 18.9% and residential mortgage loans increased by $144.0 million or 91.0% over December 31, 2014. Commercial loans increased by $179.1 million or 34.2% over December 31, 2014.\nOur lending activities are significantly influenced by the local economic environments in the markets we serve. We have grown our consumer installment, mortgage, construction and commercial loan portfolios organically and through acquisition as the economy continues to improve. Our loan portfolio is well diversified among consumer, business, and real estate lending. The credit quality of the loans we have originated continues to be strong.\n\nThe $45.0 million of trust preferred securities issued by our trust subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, are not consolidated for financial reporting purposes. Thus, the equity investments in the subsidiaries we created to issue the obligations, the obligations themselves, and related dividend income and interest expense are reported on an unconsolidated basis, with the investments in the amount of $1.4 million at December 31, 2015, and 2014, reported as other assets and dividends included as other noninterest income. The obligations, including the amount related to the equity investments along with the Notes, totaled $120.3 million and $46.3 million, at December 31, 2015, and 2014, respectively, and are reported as subordinated debt, net of unamortized issuance costs, with related interest expense reported as interest expense on subordinated debt in our consolidated financial statements.\nDeposits are a primary source of funding for us and provide us with the ability to successfully meet both short-term and long-term liquidity needs. While retail deposits are a primary source of funding and provide a customer base for cross-selling additional products and services, we also emphasize commercial accounts as an opportunity for growth and to meet our business customers' needs. We also utilize brokered deposits as a funding source, although to a lesser degree.\nOn May 29, 2015, the Bank issued $75.0 million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes (the Notes\u201d). The Notes are due May 31, 2030 and bear a fixed rate of interest of 5.875% per year until May 31, 2025. From June 1, 2025 to the maturity date, the interest rate will be a floating rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 363 basis points. The Bank incurred approximately $1.1 million of acquisition costs in connection with the debt issuance. The unamortized balance of debt issuance costs is netted against the aggregate principal amount in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Notes were priced at 100% of their par value. We can call the Notes at their par value in whole or in part on June 1, 2025 or any interest payment date thereafter. The Notes qualify as Tier 2 regulatory capital for the Bank and the Company.\n(2) Reflects fully taxable equivalent adjustments using a Federal tax rate of 35%.\nThe provision for income taxes expense for 2014 and 2013 was $16.4 million and $15.1 million, respectively, with effective tax rates of 35.4% and 35.3%, respectively.\nOur accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and conform to general practices within the financial services industry. Our financial position and results of operations are affected by management's application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions, and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Different assumptions in the application of these policies, or conditions significantly different from certain assumptions, could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. Our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d Significant accounting policies have been periodically discussed and reviewed with and approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors.\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2016-02, Leases.\u201d The new standard requires the recognition of assets and liabilities arising from lease transactions on the balance sheet and the disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. Accordingly, a lessee will recognize a lease asset for its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability for the corresponding lease obligation. Both the asset and liability will initially be measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. Subsequent measurement, including the presentation of expenses and cash flows, will depend on the classification of the lease as either a finance or an operating lease. Initial costs directly attributable to negotiating and arranging the lease will be included in the asset. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee can make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset to not recognize an asset and corresponding liability. Lessees will also be required to provide additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures are intended to supplement the amounts recorded in the financial statements and provide additional information about the nature of an organization's leasing activities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. In transition, lessees are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The transition guidance also provides specific guidance for sale and leaseback transactions, build-to-suit leases and amounts previously recognized in accordance with the business combinations guidance for leases. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of this ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n (2) Average yields reflect the effect of taxable equivalent adjustments using a 35% tax rate.  Deposits\nCritical Accounting Policies\nDetermining the fair value of assets and liabilities, particularly illiquid assets and liabilities, is a complicated process involving significant judgment regarding estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated fair value. Information regarding our loan discount and core deposit intangible asset may be adjusted as we refine our estimates. Purchase price allocations on completed acquisitions may be modified through the measurement date which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date. If we recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period, the amounts will be reported in the period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Fair value adjustments based on updated estimates could materially affect the goodwill, if any, recorded on the acquisition.\nRate shock analysis provides only a limited, point in time view of interest rate sensitivity. The actual impact of interest rate changes upon earnings and net present value may differ from that implied by any rate shock. In addition, net interest income and net present value under various future interest rate scenarios are affected by multiple other factors not embodied in a rate shock, including competition, changes in the shape of the Treasury yield curve, divergent movement among various interest rate indices, and the speed with which interest rates change.\nIncome Tax Expense\nInterest rate risk, which encompasses price risk, is the exposure of our financial condition and earnings ability to withstand adverse movements in interest rates. Accepting this risk can be an important source of profitability and shareholder value; however, excessive levels of interest rate risk can pose a significant threat to assets, earnings, and capital. Accordingly, effective risk management that maintains interest rate risk at prudent levels is essential to our success.\nNet Income\nusing multiple interest rate scenarios. The base scenario assumes the most likely estimate of future interest rate increases and balance sheet changes and is the scenario from which others are compared. Policy limits are based on immediate rate shock scenarios which are compared to the base scenario. While the primary policy scenarios focus on a twelve month time frame, longer time horizons are also modeled. In addition, management reviews the impact of various yield curve scenarios on earnings and cash flows. Our policy states that an immediate and sustained 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates should not negatively impact net interest income by more than 10%.\nThe allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans outstanding at the end of 2015 and 2014 was 0.91% and 1.13%, respectively. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans outstanding, excluding acquired loans, at the end of 2015 and 2014 was 0.97% and 1.15%, respectively. The improvement in asset quality over the past several years has offset the need for a higher allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans as a result of loan growth.\nNet recoveries on construction loans decreased by $1.1 million during 2015 to $783,000, compared to net recoveries of $1.9 million in 2014. Net recoveries on construction loans were higher during 2014 primarily due to a recovery of $1.5 million on one relationship during 2014.", "item_7_tables": "Table 83: <table><tr><td> </td>
