Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOverview\nOur Business\nManning & Napier, Inc. is an independent investment management firm that provides our clients with a broad range of financial solutions and investment strategies. Founded in 1970 and headquartered in Fairport, New York, we serve a diversified client base of high-net-worth individuals and institutions, including 401(k) plans, pension plans, Taft-Hartley plans, endowments and foundations. Our investment strategies offer equity, fixed income and a range of blended asset portfolios by employing traditional and quantitative approaches.\nMarket Developments\nGlobal equity performance was strong in 2019, with the major gains driven by an easing of several key risks that had been acting as an overhang on markets. Growth in U.S. equities was particularly strong, although international markets experienced solid gains as well. Within the U.S., small-cap stocks slightly outperformed large-cap stocks, and stylistically, growth again outperformed value, continuing a multi-year trend.\nRegarding fixed income, performance was good for the year as falling interest rates provided a boost to bond market returns, although we expect low starting yields to create a challenging long-term environment for fixed income investors. Going forward, elevated valuations and slow economic growth are likely to challenge long-run returns. Given today's muted market backdrop, we believe an active investment approach may become an increasingly attractive approach to meeting financial goals and objectives.\nBusiness Review\nWe commenced a strategic review of our business upon the appointment of our new Chief Executive Officer, Marc Mayer, in early 2019. Our review was comprehensive in nature, and resulted in changes to our overall distribution strategy, our suite of investment offerings, and our operational platform. The objective of this review was to improve financial results for shareholders and investment results for clients by more clearly prioritizing our strengths, eliminating distractions and sub-scale offerings, and increasing productivity across the firm through improved technology.\nWe have enhanced our distribution efforts under the direction of our two new sales heads, with Greg Woodard leading the Wealth Management team and Aaron McGreevy leading the Intermediary and Institutional team. During 2019, the Wealth Management team reviewed our strategy to engage both current clients and prospects on our existing suite of advisory service offerings, as well as to add to our existing team of financial consultants and increase our prospecting efforts. This review of our intermediary and institutional distribution strategy resulted in changes to our territory coverage and servicing efforts in order to more effectively service our existing clients with our small team, while concentrating on geographies with the greatest chances for growth.\nThe review of our investment offerings was focused on eliminating the distraction of sub-scale and underperforming strategies so that the team could continue to focus on generating competitive returns for clients. During 2019, we closed 3 sub-scale or under performing mutual fund offerings and 11 collective investment trusts.\nAs part of our review of sub-scale product offerings, during 2019, we sold our wholly-owned subsidiary Perspective Partners, LLC ( PPI\u201d), an employee benefits software and service provider to plan sponsors, administrators, and participants to Manning Partners, LLC, an entity owned by William Manning, the Chairman of our Board of Directors. We received $3.1 million of cash proceeds and recorded a $2.9 million gain on the sale.\nOur review also included an evaluation of our operational and technology platforms. We concluded our existing processes were overly complicated, in large part due to our legacy, internally-developed technology platform. In December 2019, we announced a new partnership with industry leader InvestCloud. The InvestCloud partnership, in conjunction with other technology enhancements, is a critical step in our digital transformation. We estimate the implementation of our upgraded technology platform will occur during the second half of 2021.\nAs a result of this strategic review, we incurred approximately $11.1 million of strategic restructuring and transaction costs, excluding the $2.9 million gain on the sale of PPI noted above. These charges consisted of $3.4 million of employee severance costs and $7.7 million of other operating costs, including $6.3 million of charges stemming from the write-off of existing contracts that we will not be utilizing as we move forward with InvestCloud. We will incur additional costs in 2020 relating to implementing the initiatives from this strategic review.\nOur Solutions\nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management fees earned from providing advisory services to separately managed accounts and to mutual funds and collective investment trusts-including those offered by Manning & Napier Advisors, LLC (\"MNA\"), the Manning & Napier Fund, Inc.(the \"Fund\"), Exeter Trust Company, and Rainier Investment Management, LLC (\"Rainier\").\nOur separate accounts are primarily distributed through our wealth management sales channel, where our financial consultants form relationships with high-net-worth individuals, endowments, foundations, and retirement plans. To a lesser extent, we also obtain a portion of our separate account distribution via third parties, either through our intermediary sales channel where national brokerage firm representatives or independent financial advisors select our separate account strategies for their clients, or through our platform/sub-advisor relationships, where unaffiliated registered investment advisors approve our strategies for their product platforms. Our separate account strategies are a primary driver of our blended asset portfolios for high-net-worth, middle market institutional clients and financial intermediaries. In contrast, larger institutions and unaffiliated registered investment advisor platforms are a driver of our separate account equity portfolios.\nOur mutual funds and collective investment trusts are distributed through financial intermediaries, including brokers, financial advisors, retirement plan advisors and platform relationships. We also distribute our mutual fund and collective investment trusts through our institutional representatives, particularly within the defined contribution, Taft-Hartley, and institutional marketplace. Our mutual fund and collective investment trust strategies are an important driver of our blended asset class and single asset class portfolios.\nOur assets under management (\"AUM\") were $19.5 billion as of December 31, 2019. The composition of our AUM by vehicle and portfolio is set forth in the table below:\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AUM - by investment vehicle and portfolio:\n</td> <td>Blended\nAsset\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fixed\nIncome\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Separately managed accounts\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,501.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,226.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>916.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,644.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mutual funds and collective investment trusts\n</td> <td>3,972.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,762.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,835.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,473.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,988.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,018.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,480.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAssets Under Management\nDuring 2019, we changed our distribution strategy following a business review to better capitalize on our strengths. As part of this change, we have adjusted our sales efforts to more distinctly separate the clients to which we deliver holistic solutions, including high-net-worth families, endowments and foundations, and small and mid-sized business, from our Institutional and Intermediary clients, including third party advisors, platforms and consultants, as well as larger institutions and Taft-Hartley clients.

Blended portfolios are the most significant portion of wealth management assets, representing 82% of wealth management AUM. Equity and fixed income portfolios represent 15% and 3% respectively, of wealth management AUM.\nOur institutional and intermediary channel represented 55% of our total AUM as of December 31, 2019. Blended portfolios are also the largest portion of institutional and intermediary assets at 59% of AUM, followed by equity and fixed income portfolios at 34% and 7%, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2019, blended portfolios account for 70% of our total AUM at $13.5 billion, consistent with blended portfolio AUM at December 31, 2018. Blended portfolio AUM is similar across both distribution channels, with 53% in wealth management and 47% in institutional and intermediary. Equity portfolios account for 25% of our total AUM, at $5.0 billion, a 9% decrease from December 31, 2018, when equity portfolios were at $5.5 billion. Of equity portfolio AUM, 74% is in the institutional and intermediary channel, and 26% is in the wealth management channel. Fixed income portfolios account for 5% of total AUM at $1.0 billion, a 10% decrease from December 31, 2018, when fixed income assets were $1.1 billion. Consistent with equity portfolio AUM, the majority of fixed income assets come through the institutional and intermediary channel at 72% and 28% of fixed income AUM is in the wealth management channel.\nOur separate accounts contributed 55% of our total gross client inflows for the year ended December 31, 2019 and represented 70% of our total AUM as of December 31, 2019.\nOur separate account business has historically been driven primarily by our wealth management channel, where financial consultants form a relationship with high-net-worth investors, endowments, foundations, and retirement plans. The wealth management sales channel contributed 67% of the total gross client inflows for our separate account business for the year ended December 31, 2019 and represented 56% of our total separate account AUM as of December 31, 2019. We anticipate this channel to continue to be the largest driver of new separate account business going forward, given their high-net-worth and advisory client-type focus.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, blended asset portfolios represented 51% of the separate account gross client inflows from the wealth management sales channel, while equity and fixed income portfolios represented 45% and 4%, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, blended asset and equity portfolios represented 81% and 15%, respectively, of total wealth management separate account AUM, while our fixed income portfolios were 4%. We expect our focus on individuals, endowments, foundations, and retirement plans to continue to drive interest in our separately managed account investment strategies.\nWe also obtain separate account business from third parties, including financial advisors or unaffiliated registered investment advisor programs or platforms. During the year ended December 31, 2019, 33% of the total gross client inflows for separate accounts came from financial advisor representatives and registered investment advisor platforms. The institutional and intermediary sales channel collectively represented 44% of our separate account AUM as of December 31, 2019.\nNew separate account business through the institutional and intermediary sales channel flowed into both our blended asset and equity portfolios. During the year ended December 31, 2019, blended asset, equity, and fixed income portfolios represented 45%, 45%, and 10%, respectively, of the separate account gross client inflows from the institutional and intermediary sales channel. As of December 31, 2019, 59% of our total AUM derived from institutions and intermediaries was allocated to blended asset portfolios, with 34% allocated to equity and 7% allocated to fixed income. We expect that equity and fixed income portfolios may see additional interest from intermediaries over time as more advisors structure a multi-strategy portfolio for their clients.\nOur annualized separate account retention rate across all channels was 83% during the year ended December 31, 2019, a small decrease from our historical retention rate, which was 86% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOur mutual funds and collective investment trusts contributed 45% of our total gross client inflows for the year ended December 31, 2019 and represented 30% of our total AUM as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, our mutual fund and collective investment trust AUM consisted of 68% from blended asset portfolios, 30% from equity portfolios and 2% from fixed income portfolios, compared to 70%, 28% and 2% for blended asset, equity and fixed income portfolios, respectively, as of December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, 59%, 36% and 5% of mutual fund and collective gross client inflows were attributable to blended assets, equity and fixed income portfolios, respectively.\nOur mutual fund and collective investment trust business is driven by both financial intermediaries, as well as through our wealth management channel. Through our intermediary channel, we are focused on promoting our single-asset class and specialized strategies to our wealth and retirement plan advisors, who wish to use our strategies as a component of a larger portfolio. Additionally, our blended asset portfolios are used by advisors seeking a multi-asset class solution for their retail clients.\nWe also have relationships with consultants and manager research teams at platforms in order to distribute our funds within advisory programs, or through placement on platforms' approved lists of funds. To facilitate our relationships with intermediaries, we currently have approximately 245 dealer relationships. These relationships are important to our retail business as well as our 401(k) life cycle and institutional business.\nThrough the institutional and intermediary channel, our representatives promote our portfolios to large institutional clients with which we have direct relationships, as well as consultants. Additionally, we have relationships with middle-market and large market defined contribution plan sponsors seeking to use our life cycle mutual funds and collective investment trusts as default options on their investment menu. In the wealth management channel, we may see additional interest in our mutual funds and collective investment trust strategies through both blended and single-asset class portfolios based on the needs of the clients.\nResults of Operations\nBelow is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nOverview\nOur operating results are heavily influenced by the absolute returns generated by global financial markets. In addition, an important distinguishing factor is the relative performance of our various investment strategies. All of our investment processes are based on the fundamental belief that active management is the best investment approach for helping clients meet long-term goals and objectives. As an active manager, we regularly maintain a high active share across many of our key strategies, and at times, these strategies experience performance that meaningfully deviates from market benchmarks. When performance is strong, this can cause us to experience sizeable inflows in AUM, and when performance is weak, we can experience outflows in AUM.\nIn addition, other components impacting our operating results include:\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>asset-based fee rates and changes in those rates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90:

AUM. We earn our investment management fees as a percentage of our clients' AUM either as of a specified date or on a daily basis. Our investment management fees can fluctuate based on the average fee rate for our investment management products, which are affected by the composition of our AUM among various portfolios and investment vehicles.\nWe serve as the investment adviser for the Fund, Exeter Trust Company Collective Investment Trusts and Rainier Multiple Investment Trust. The mutual funds are open-end mutual funds designed to meet the needs of a range of institutional and other investors.The collective investment trusts are for qualified retirement plans, including 401(k) plans. These mutual funds and collective investment trusts comprised $5.8 billion, or 30%, of our AUM as of December 31, 2019. We also serve as the investment advisor to all of our separately managed accounts, managing $13.6 billion, or 70%, of our AUM as of December 31, 2019, including assets managed as a sub-advisor to pooled investment vehicles. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our revenue earned from clients located in the United States was 99% and 98%, respectively.\nWe earn distribution and servicing fees for providing services to our affiliated mutual funds. Revenue is computed and earned daily based on a percentage of AUM.\nWe earn custodial service fees for administrative and safeguarding services performed by Exeter Trust Company, our New Hampshire-chartered trust company. Fees are calculated as a percentage of the client's market value with additional fees for certain transactions.\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, we completed the effort to restructure fees for many of our mutual fund and collective trust vehicles. The impacts on our overall revenue margins and operating expenses are described below in the discussion of results for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOperating Expenses\nOur largest operating expenses are employee compensation and related costs, and to a lesser degree, distribution, servicing and custody expenses, discussed further below, with a significant portion of these expenses varying in a direct relationship to our absolute and relative investment management performance, as well as AUM and revenues. We review our operating expenses in relation to the investment market environment and changes in our revenues. However, we are generally willing to make expenditures as necessary, even when faced with declining rates of growth in revenues in order to support our investment products, our client service levels, strategic initiatives and our long-term value.\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Compensation and related costs. Employee compensation and related costs represent our largest expense, including employee salaries and benefits, incentive compensation to investment and sales professionals, compensation issued under our long-term incentive plan as well as equity compensation. These costs are affected by changes in the employee headcount, the mix of existing job descriptions, competitive factors, the addition of new skill sets and variations in the level of our AUM and revenues. These costs are also impacted by the number of awards granted under our equity plan and the amount of deferred cash awards granted under our long-term incentive plan. Incentive compensation for our research team considers the cumulative impact of both absolute and relative investment performance over historical time periods, with more weight placed on the recent periods. As such, incentive compensation paid to our research team will vary, in part, based on absolute and relative investment performance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Distribution, servicing and custody expenses. Distribution, servicing and custody expense represent amounts paid to various intermediaries for distribution, shareholder servicing, administrative servicing and custodial services. These expenses generally increase or decrease in line with changes in our mutual fund and collective investment trust AUM or services performed by these intermediaries. During the first quarter of 2019, we completed the effort, begun in 2017, of restructuring fees across our mutual funds. The financial impacts were a reduction in the management fees on existing business, and an offsetting reduction in related distribution, servicing and custody expenses. Given the overall pressure on fees that all active managers are facing, we believe that bringing our fund fees to a more competitive level will enhance our ability to attract additional assets in the future.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Other operating costs. Other operating costs include accounting, legal and other professional service fees, occupancy and facility costs, travel and entertainment expenses, insurance, market data service expenses and all other miscellaneous costs associated with managing the day-to-day operations of our business.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Non-Operating Income (Loss)\nNon-operating income (loss) includes interest expense, interest and dividend income, changes in liability under the tax receivable agreement (\"TRA\") entered into between Manning & Napier and the other holders of Class A units of Manning & Napier Group, gains (losses) related to investment securities sales and changes in values of those investment securities designated as equity investments, at fair value and gain on sale of business.\nWe expect the interest and investment components of non-operating income (loss) to fluctuate based on market conditions, the performance of our investments and the overall amount of our investments held by the Company to provide initial cash seeding for product development purposes and short-term investment for cash management opportunities.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Company is comprised of entities that have elected to be treated as either a limited liability company (\"LLC\") or a C-Corporation.\u201d As such, the entities functioning as LLC's are not liable for or able to benefit from U.S. federal or most state and local income taxes on their earnings, and their earnings (losses) will be included in the personal income tax returns of each entity's unit holders. The entities functioning as C-Corporations are liable for or able to benefit from U.S. federal and state and local income taxes on their earnings and losses, respectively.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nManning & Napier, Inc. holds an economic interest of approximately 19.2% in Manning & Napier Group as of December 31, 2019, but as managing member controls all of the business and affairs of Manning & Napier Group. As a result, the Company consolidates the financial results of Manning & Napier Group and records a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of operations represents the portion of earnings attributable to the economic interest in Manning & Napier Group held by the noncontrolling interests.\nAccounting Policies and Estimates\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\") and the related rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates or\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates or assumptions and may have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting policies are an integral part of our financial statements. A thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial condition. Our management has identified the following significant accounting policies that are critical to understanding our business and prospects for future performance, as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and other significant areas that involve management's judgment and estimates.\nThese policies and our procedures related to these policies are described in detail below. Please also refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of our accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nInvestment Management: Investment management fees are computed as a percentage of AUM. Our performance obligation is a series of services that form part of a single performance obligation satisfied over time.\nSeparately managed accounts are paid in advance, typically for a semi-annual or quarterly period, or in arrears, typically for a monthly or quarterly period. When investment management fees are paid in advance, we defer the revenue as a contract liability and recognize it over the applicable period. When investment management fees are paid in arrears, we estimate revenue and record a contract asset (accrued accounts receivable) based on AUM as of the most recent month end date.\nMutual funds and collective investment trust investment management revenue is calculated and earned daily based on AUM. Revenue is presented net of cash rebates and fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds. We also have agreements with third parties who provide recordkeeping and administrative services for employee benefit plans participating in the collective investment trusts. We are acting as an agent on behalf of the employee benefit plan sponsors, therefore, investment management revenue is recorded net of fees paid to third party service providers.\nDistribution and shareholder servicing: We receive distribution and servicing fees for providing services to our affiliated mutual funds. Revenue is computed and earned daily based on a percentage of AUM. The performance obligation is a series of services that form part of a single performance obligation satisfied over time. We have agreements with third parties who provide distribution and administrative services for our mutual funds. The agreements are evaluated to determine whether revenue should be reported gross or net of payments to third-party service providers. We control the services provided and act as a principal in the relationship. Therefore, distribution and shareholder servicing revenue is recorded gross of fees paid to third parties.\nCustodial services: Custodial service fees are calculated as a percentage of the client's market value with additional fees charged for certain transactions. For the safeguarding and administrative services that are subject to a percentage of market value fee, our performance obligation is a series of services that form part of a single performance obligation satisfied over time. Revenue for transactions assigned a stand-alone selling price is recognized in the period which the transaction is executed. Custodial service fees are billed monthly in arrears. We have agreements with third parties who provide safeguarding, record keeping and administrative services for their clients. We control the services provided and act as a principal in the relationship. Therefore, custodial service revenue is recorded gross of fees paid to third parties.\nBecause the majority of our revenues are earned based on AUM that has been determined using fair value methods and since market appreciation/depreciation has a significant impact on our revenue, we have presented our AUM using the GAAP framework for measuring fair value. A fair value hierarchy is provided that gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The following three-tier fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value:\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 1-observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical securities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 2-other significant observable inputs (including but not limited to quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment rates, credit risk, etc.); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 3-significant unobservable inputs (including our own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below summarizes the approximate amount of AUM for the periods indicated for which fair value is measured based on Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3:\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Level 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Level 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Level 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2019 AUM\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2018 AUM\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubstantially all our AUM is valued by independent pricing services based upon observable market prices or inputs, and we believe market risk is the most significant risk underlying valuation of our AUM, as discussed in this Form 10-K under Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d.\nAll other revenue earned by us is recognized on a GAAP accounting basis as earned per the terms of the specific contract.\nConsolidation\nWe assess each legal entity in which we hold a variable interest to determine whether consolidation is appropriate at the onset of the relationship and upon certain reconsideration events. We determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in the entity by evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity (\"VOE\") or a variable interest entity (\"VIE\") under GAAP. Assessing whether an entity is a VOE or VIE and if it requires consolidation involves judgment and analysis. Factors considered in this assessment include an entity's purpose and design, a company's ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and whether a company is obligated to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the entity. The standard also requires ongoing assessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. When utilizing the VOE model, controlling financial interest is generally defined as majority ownership of voting interests.\nWe serve as the investment adviser for the Fund, Exeter Trust Company Collective Investment Trusts ( CIT\u201d) and Rainier Multiple Investment Trust, which are legal entities, the business and affairs of which are managed by their respective boards of directors. As a result, each of these entities is a VOE. We hold, in limited cases, direct investments in a fund (which are made on the same terms as are available to other investors) and consolidate each of these entities where it has a controlling financial interest or a majority voting interest.\nWe make initial seed investments in sponsored investment portfolios to develop new products and services for our clients. The original seed investment may be held in a separately managed account, comprised solely of our investments, or within a mutual fund, where our investment may represent all or only a portion of the total equity invested in the mutual fund. We evaluate our seed investments on a regular basis and consolidate such mutual funds for which we hold a controlling financial interest. When we no longer hold a financial controlling interest, we deconsolidate the fund and classify the remaining investment as either an equity method investment or as equity investments, at fair value, as applicable.\nAs of December 31, 2019, Manning & Napier holds an economic interest of approximately 19.2% in Manning & Napier Group, but as managing member controls all of the business and affairs of Manning & Napier Group. As a result, we consolidate the financial results of Manning & Napier Group and record a noncontrolling interest on our consolidated statements of financial condition with respect to the remaining economic interest in Manning & Napier Group held by M&N Group Holdings and MNCC.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of our investment in net assets of acquired companies over the fair value of the underlying identifiable net assets at the dates of acquisition. We attribute all goodwill associated with past acquisitions to our single reporting unit. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit associated with the goodwill to the reporting unit's recorded value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its recorded value an impairment loss will be recorded.\nThe annual test of goodwill indicated that there were no facts or circumstances occurring in 2019 suggesting possible impairment. The impairment tests included certain underlying key assumptions regarding future overall market trends and our operating performance. If actual future market results and our operating performance vary unfavorably to those included in our financial forecast, we may be subject to impairment charges related to its goodwill.\nIncome Tax Provision\nManagement judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance that might be required against deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2019, we have not recorded a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. In the event that sufficient taxable income does not result in future years, among other things, a valuation allowance for certain of our deferred tax assets may be required. Because\nthe determination of our annual income tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates, it is likely that the actual results will vary from those recorded in our financial statements. Hence, we recognize additions to and reductions in income tax expense during a reporting period that pertains to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and our actual tax returns and tax audits are completed.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized.\nPayments Pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement\nAs a result of Manning & Napier's purchase of Class A units of Manning & Napier Group or exchange for Class A common stock of Manning & Napier for Class A units of Manning & Napier Group and Manning & Napier Group's election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code, we expect to benefit from depreciation and amortization deductions from an increase in tax basis of tangible and intangible assets of Manning & Napier Group. Those deductions allocated to us will be taken into account in reporting our taxable income.\nIn connection with our initial public offering (\"IPO\"), the TRA was entered into between Manning & Napier and the holders of Manning & Napier Group, pursuant to which Manning & Napier is required to pay to such holders 85% of the applicable cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income tax that Manning & Napier actually realizes, or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances, as a result of (i) certain tax attributes of their units sold to Manning & Napier or exchanged (for shares of Class A common stock) and that are created as a result of the sales or exchanges and payments under the TRA and (ii) tax benefits related to imputed interest.\nAt December 31, 2019, we have recorded a total liability of $17.5 million, representing the payments due to the selling unit holders under the TRA. Payments are anticipated to be made annually commencing from the date of each event that gives rise to the TRA benefits. The actual amount and timing of any payments may vary from this estimate due to a number of factors, including a material change in the relevant tax law or our failure to earn sufficient taxable income to realize all estimated tax benefits. The expected payment obligation assumes no additional uncertain tax positions that would impact the TRAs.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,

decrease of $0.7 billion, or 3%, to $19.5 billion at December 31, 2019 from $20.2 billion at December 31, 2018 was attributable to net client outflows of $4.5 billion, partially offset by $3.8 billion of market appreciation and other changes. Net client outflows consisted of approximately $2.8 billion of net outflows from separate accounts and $1.7 billion from mutual funds and collective investment trusts. By portfolio, the rates of change in AUM from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 consisted of a $0.5 billion, or 9.3% decrease in our equity portfolio, and a $0.1 billion, or 0.4% decrease in our blended asset portfolio.\nWhile many of our key strategies achieved competitive relative returns in 2019, we attribute our 2019 net cash outflows to challenging three and five year annualized returns in many of the strategies included in our blended asset portfolios. We believe that our ability to improve cash flows going forward will depend on our ability to sustain the improved investment performance we achieved over the past year and execute on our strategic initiatives focused on gathering and retaining client assets.\nThe composition of our AUM was 70% in separate accounts and 30% in mutual funds and collective investment trusts as of December 31, 2019, a shift from 68% in separate accounts and 32% in mutual funds and collective investment trusts at December 31, 2018. The composition of our AUM across portfolios at December 31, 2019 was 69% in blended assets, 26% in equity, and 5% in fixed income, compared to 67% in blended assets, 27% in equity, and 6% in fixed income at December 31, 2018.\nWith regard to our separate accounts, gross client inflows of $1.5 billion were offset by approximately $4.2 billion of gross client outflows during the year ended December 31, 2019. The $1.5 billion of gross client inflows included $0.7 billion into our blended asset portfolios, $0.7 billion into our equity portfolios and $0.1 billion into fixed income. During the year ended December 31, 2019, 67% of our separate account gross client inflows were derived from our wealth management channel with 58% representing contributions from existing wealth management relationships. Across both channels, gross client outflows were split with 43% withdrawals from existing accounts and 57% representing client cancellations. Included within the $4.2 billion of client outflows during the year ended December 31, 2019 was a cancellation of a Sub-Advisory relationship during the fourth quarter of 2019 of approximately $1.0 billion. Our blended asset and equity portfolios experienced net client outflows of approximately $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. Our separate account clients redeemed assets at a rate of 31% during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to a 24% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The annualized separate account retention rate was 83% for the year ended December 31, 2019 a slight decrease from 86% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNet client outflows of $1.7 billion from our mutual fund and collective investment trusts included gross client inflows of $1.2 billion offset by gross client outflows of $3.0 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross client inflows into our blended asset life cycle vehicles, including both risk based and target date strategies, represented $0.7 billion, or 59%, of mutual fund and collective trust fund gross client inflows during the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross client outflows were predominantly driven by cancellations and withdrawals from defined contribution and institutional relationships. With regard to gross client outflows, $1.9 billion, or 65%, of mutual fund and collective investment trust gross client outflows were from blended asset mutual fund and collective trust products.\nThe

the year ended December 31, 2019 from $97.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is driven primarily by an 8%, or $1.3 billion decrease in our average separately managed account AUM for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. On an annualized basis, our average separately managed account fee for the year ended December 31, 2019 remained consistent at 0.60% when compared to the full year 2018. For both periods our separately managed account standard fees ranged from 0.15% to 1.25% depending upon investment objective and account size. As of December 31, 2019, the concentration of investments in our separately managed account assets was 70% blended assets, 24% equity and 6% fixed income, compared to 65% blended assets, 27% equity and 8% fixed income as of December 31, 2018.\nMutual fund and collective investment trust revenue decreased by $12.1 million, or 29%, to $29.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $41.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was driven primarily by a 15%, or $1.1 billion, decrease in our average mutual fund and collective investment trust AUM for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, coupled with the effects of the mutual fund fee restructure completed in the first quarter of 2019. On an annualized basis, our average fee on mutual fund and collective investment trust products decreased to 0.64% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 0.73% for the full year 2018. This decrease was due primarily to the restructuring of our funds during 2019. For both periods, management fees earned on our mutual fund and collective investment trust management fees ranged from 0.14% to 0.90%, depending on investment strategy. As of December 31, 2019, the concentration of investments in our mutual fund and collective investment trusts was 68% blended assets, 30% equity and 2% fixed income, compared to 70% blended assets, 28% equity and 2% fixed income as of December 31, 2018.\nDistribution and shareholder servicing revenue decreased by $1.9 million, or 15%, to $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was driven primarily by the reduction in mutual fund and collective trust average AUM of 15% for the same period.\nCustodial services revenue decreased by $0.7 million, or 10%, to $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease primarily relates to decreases in our collective investment trust AUM.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses decreased by $4.7 million, or 3%, to $133.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $137.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCompensation and related costs decreased by $6.4 million, or 7%, to $81.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $87.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was driven by a 16% reduction in our average workforce and lower variable incentive costs as a result of the reduction in AUM and revenue. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $2.4 million in 2019 from 2018 attributable to the timing and amount of awards granted under our equity and long-term incentive plans. Employee severance costs decreased by $0.7 million to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As a percentage of revenue, compensation and related costs for 2019 were 60%, compared to 54% in 2018.\nDistribution, servicing and custody expenses decreased by $5.6 million, or 31%, to $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in expense was driven by a 15% decrease in mutual funds and collective investment trusts average AUM during the year ended December 31, 2019 as well as the completion of the Advisor's mutual fund fee restructure during the first quarter of 2019. As a percentage of mutual fund and collective investment trust average AUM, distribution, servicing and custody expense was 0.20% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 0.25% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOther operating costs increased by $7.4 million, or 23%, to $39.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $32.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2019 was driven primarily by $6.3 million of expenses recognized during the fourth quarter of 2019 related to our technology upgrade initiatives. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we entered into a contract with a new third-party service provider which will replace an existing license agreement for internal-use software. As a result, we recorded charges of approximately $2.1 million for the impairment of existing internal-use software, $1.0 million for the write-off of associated prepaid license costs, and $3.2 million for future cash obligations under the existing license agreement. The increase in other operating costs over 2018 is also driven by the $2.1 million gain reflected during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the Company's sale of Rainier U.S. mutual funds, which offset other operating costs in the period. As a percentage of revenue, other operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were 29% and 20%, respectively.\nNon-Operating Income (Loss)\nNon-operating income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $7.6 million, an increase of $5.3 million, from non-operating income of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

The change was primarily driven by a decrease in taxable earnings as compared to the prior year.\nSupplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information\nTo provide investors with greater insight into operating results, promote transparency, facilitate comparison of period-to-period results, and to allow a more comprehensive understanding of information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, we supplement our consolidated statements of operations presented on a GAAP basis with non-GAAP financial measures of earnings.\nBeginning with the release of our operating results for the third quarter of 2019, as supplemental information we began providing a new non-GAAP measure, economic income. Management uses economic income, economic net income and economic net income per adjusted share as financial measures to evaluate the profitability and efficiency of our business as a whole in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of its operations. Economic income, economic net income and economic net income per adjusted share are not presented in accordance with GAAP.\nEconomic income, for periods beginning in and subsequent to January 1, 2019, presents a financial measure of the controlling and non-controlling interests of Manning & Napier Group and excludes from income before provision for income taxes strategic restructuring and transaction costs, net. We define strategic restructuring and transaction costs, net, as items related to our ongoing strategic review focused on the evolution of our distribution strategy and technology initiatives. These include severance-related costs, certain consulting and other professional service fees, lease and other contract termination costs, and gain or loss on sale of a business.\nEconomic net income is a non-GAAP measure of after-tax operating performance for the controlling and non-controlling interests of Manning & Napier Group and equals the Company's income before provision for income taxes less adjusted\nincome taxes. Adjusted income taxes are estimated assuming the exchange of all outstanding units of Manning & Napier Group into Class A common stock on a one-to-one basis. Therefore, all income of Manning & Napier Group allocated to the units of Manning & Napier Group is treated as if it were allocated to Manning & Napier and represents an estimate of income tax expense at an effective rate of 29.0% and 32.0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, reflecting assumed federal, state and local income taxes.\nEconomic net income per adjusted share is equal to economic net income divided by the total number of adjusted Class A common shares outstanding. The number of adjusted Class A common shares outstanding for all periods presented is determined by assuming the weighted average exchangeable units of Manning & Napier Group, weighted average unvested restricted stock unit, weighted average unvested restricted stock awards and weighted average vested stock options are converted into the Company's outstanding Class A common stock as of the respective reporting date, on a one-to-one basis. The Company's management uses economic net income, among other financial data, to determine the earnings available to distribute as dividends to holders of its Class A common stock and to the holders of the units of Manning & Napier Group.\nInvestors should consider the non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, our non-GAAP measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our other financial and operating data:\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except share data)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic income (Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic net income (Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>13,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic net income per adjusted share (Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average adjusted Class A common stock outstanding (Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>79,392,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78,916,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures:\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except share data)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Manning & Napier, Inc.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add back: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>8,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add back: Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>10,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add back: strategic restructuring and transaction costs, net (1)\n</td> <td>8,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic income (Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>18,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted income taxes (Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>5,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic net income (Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average shares of Class A common stock outstanding -

As managing member of Manning & Napier Group, we will determine the timing and amount of any distributions paid to its members. We intend to cause Manning & Napier Group to distribute cash to its members, including us, in an amount sufficient to cover taxes and operating expenses, including dividends, if any, declared by us. If we do cause Manning & Napier Group to make such distributions, M&N Group Holdings, MNCC and any other holders of units of Manning & Napier Group will be entitled to receive equivalent distributions on a pari passu basis.\nIn determining the sufficiency of liquidity and capital resources to fund our business, we regularly monitor our liquidity position, including among other things, cash, working capital, long-term liabilities, lease commitments and operating company distributions.\nOn August 30, 2019, the Company sold its wholly-owned subsidiary, PPI, to Manning Partners, LLC, which is wholly-owned by the Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors. The Company received cash proceeds of $3.1 million, and recorded a $2.9 million gain on the sale. Other than the cash proceeds received, the transaction did not have a material impact to the consolidated statements of financial condition.\nThe Company is nearing the completion of the 2020 exchange period whereby eligible Class A units of Manning & Napier Group held by M&N Group Holdings and MNCC may be tendered for exchange. In connection with the exchange, the Company has the ability to pay an amount of cash equal to the number of units exchanged multiplied by the value of one share\nof the Company's Class A common stock less a market discount and expected expenses, or at the Company's election issue shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis.\nWe believe cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient over the next twelve months to meet our working capital requirements. Further, we expect that cash on hand, including short-term investments and cash generated by operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Operating activities consist primarily of net income subject to adjustments for changes in operating assets and liabilities, equity-based compensation expense, changes in the liability under the TRA, deferred income tax expense, gain on sale of business and of intangible assets, and depreciation and amortization. Investing activities consist primarily of the purchase and sale of investments for the purpose of providing initial cash seeding for product development purposes and cash management purposes, gain on sale of intangible assets, gain on sale of business and purchases of property and equipment. Financing activities consist primarily of distributions to noncontrolling interests, dividends paid on our Class A common stock, and purchases of Class A units held by the noncontrolling interests of Manning & Napier Group.\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>3,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,508\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>(10,640\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20,006\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash flows\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18,676\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nOperating activities provided $15.0 million and $22.8 million of net cash for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This overall $7.9 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was due to a decrease in net income after adjustment for non-cash items of approximately $13.9 million, which was driven by lower revenues resulting primarily from the decrease in our average AUM. This was partially offset by an overall increase of approximately $6.1 million in operating assets and liabilities.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activities provided $3.2 million and used $21.5 million of net cash for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This change was driven by an increase in cash from investing activities of $24.7 million due to our funding of and timing of activity within our investment securities. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we received approximately $3.0 million, net, from the purchase and sale of certain securities for cash management purposes and received approximately $0.1 million of net proceeds from the redemption of certain seeded portfolios during 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we used $21.6 million, net, from the purchase and sale of certain securities for cash management purposes. In addition, we received proceeds from the sale of intangible assets and businesses of approximately $3.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $2.6 million in the same period of 2018. Our purchases of property and equipment were approximately $2.5 million and $2.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities used $10.6 million and $20.0 million of net cash for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This overall $9.4 million decrease in net cash used in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily the result of a reduction in distributions to noncontrolling interests of $7.2 million and dividends paid on Class A common stock of $3.6 million driven by lower net income. These decreases in cash used were partially offset by a $1.1 million increase in cash used in 2019 for the purchase of Class A units of Manning & Napier Group pursuant to the exchange agreement entered into at the time of our IPO of $3.1 million in 2019 compared to $1.9 million in 2018. This increase was due to a higher number of units exchanged in 2019.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2019.", "item_7_truncated": "As of December 31, 2019, Manning & Napier holds an economic interest of approximately 19.2% in Manning & Napier Group, but as managing member controls all of the business and affairs of Manning & Napier Group.

This increase was due to a higher number of units exchanged in 2019.\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation and related costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating costs\n</td> <td>7,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of business\n</td> <td>(2,883\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total strategic restructuring and transaction costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (2) Market appreciation/(depreciation) and other includes investment gains/(losses) on assets under management, the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and net flows from non-sales related activities including net reinvested dividends. \nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management fees earned from providing advisory services to separately managed accounts and to mutual funds and collective investment trusts-including those offered by Manning & Napier Advisors, LLC (\"MNA\"), the Manning & Napier Fund, Inc.(the \"Fund\"), Exeter Trust Company, and Rainier Investment Management, LLC (\"Rainier\").\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except share data)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Manning & Napier, Inc.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add back: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>8,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add back: Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>10,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add back: strategic restructuring and transaction costs, net (1)\n</td> <td>8,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic income (Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>18,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted income taxes (Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>5,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic net income (Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average shares of Class A common stock outstanding - Basic\n</td> <td>15,216,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,623,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumed vesting, conversion or exchange of:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average Manning & Napier Group units outstanding (noncontrolling interest)\n</td> <td>62,470,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63,489,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average unvested restricted stock units and stock awards\n</td> <td>1,705,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>803,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average vested stock options\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average adjusted shares (Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>79,392,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78,916,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic net income per adjusted share (Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth certain key financial data relating to our liquidity and capital resources as of December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nConsolidation\nOur largest operating expenses are employee compensation and related costs, and to a lesser degree, distribution, servicing and custody expenses, discussed further below, with a significant portion of these expenses varying in a direct relationship to our absolute and relative investment management performance, as well as AUM and revenues.

Additionally, our non-GAAP measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures.\nThe table below summarizes the approximate amount of AUM for the periods indicated for which fair value is measured based on Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3:\nOur Solutions\n\nSubstantially all our AUM is valued by independent pricing services based upon observable market prices or inputs, and we believe market risk is the most significant risk underlying valuation of our AUM, as discussed in this Form 10-K under Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d.\nBelow is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\nOur revenues primarily consist of investment management fees earned from managing our clients' AUM. We earn our investment management fees as a percentage of our clients' AUM either as of a specified date or on a daily basis. Our investment management fees can fluctuate based on the average fee rate for our investment management products, which are affected by the composition of our AUM among various portfolios and investment vehicles.\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Operating activities consist primarily of net income subject to adjustments for changes in operating assets and liabilities, equity-based compensation expense, changes in the liability under the TRA, deferred income tax expense, gain on sale of business and of intangible assets, and depreciation and amortization. Investing activities consist primarily of the purchase and sale of investments for the purpose of providing initial cash seeding for product development purposes and cash management purposes, gain on sale of intangible assets, gain on sale of business and purchases of property and equipment. Financing activities consist primarily of distributions to noncontrolling interests, dividends paid on our Class A common stock, and purchases of Class A units held by the noncontrolling interests of Manning & Napier Group.\n________________________\n\nIn addition, other components impacting our operating results include:\nBusiness Review\nBecause the majority of our revenues are earned based on AUM that has been determined using fair value methods and since market appreciation/depreciation has a significant impact on our revenue, we have presented our AUM using the GAAP framework for measuring fair value. A fair value hierarchy is provided that gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The following three-tier fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value:\nOur assets under management (\"AUM\") were $19.5 billion as of December 31, 2019. The composition of our AUM by vehicle and portfolio is set forth in the table below:\n\nTo provide investors with greater insight into operating results, promote transparency, facilitate comparison of period-to-period results, and to allow a more comprehensive understanding of information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, we supplement our consolidated statements of operations presented on a GAAP basis with non-GAAP financial measures of earnings.\nRevenues\nWe also have relationships with consultants and manager research teams at platforms in order to distribute our funds within advisory programs, or through placement on platforms' approved lists of funds. To facilitate our relationships with intermediaries, we currently have approximately 245 dealer relationships. These relationships are important to our retail business as well as our 401(k) life cycle and institutional business.\nOur separate accounts are primarily distributed through our wealth management sales channel, where our financial consultants form relationships with high-net-worth individuals, endowments, foundations, and retirement plans. To a lesser extent, we also obtain a portion of our separate account distribution via third parties, either through our intermediary sales channel where national brokerage firm representatives or independent financial advisors select our separate account strategies for their clients, or through our platform/sub-advisor relationships, where unaffiliated registered investment advisors approve our strategies for their product platforms. Our separate account strategies are a primary driver of our blended asset portfolios for high-net-worth, middle market institutional clients and financial intermediaries. In contrast, larger institutions and unaffiliated registered investment advisor platforms are a driver of our separate account equity portfolios.\nOperating Activities\nComponents of Results of Operations\nAccounting Policies and Estimates\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNew separate account business through the institutional and intermediary sales channel flowed into both our blended asset and equity portfolios. During the year ended December 31, 2019, blended asset, equity, and fixed income portfolios represented 45%, 45%, and 10%, respectively, of the separate account gross client inflows from the institutional and intermediary sales channel. As of December 31, 2019, 59% of our total AUM derived from institutions and intermediaries was allocated to blended asset portfolios, with 34% allocated to equity and 7% allocated to fixed income. We expect that equity and fixed income portfolios may see additional interest from intermediaries over time as more advisors structure a multi-strategy portfolio for their clients.\nOur mutual funds and collective investment trusts are distributed through financial intermediaries, including brokers, financial advisors, retirement plan advisors and platform relationships. We also distribute our mutual fund and collective investment trusts through our institutional representatives, particularly within the defined contribution, Taft-Hartley, and institutional marketplace. Our mutual fund and collective investment trust strategies are an important driver of our blended asset class and single asset class portfolios.\n(1) Strategic restructuring and transaction costs, net, are included in the following financial statement line items of our Consolidated Statements of Operations:\nNon-operating income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $7.6 million, an increase of $5.3 million, from non-operating income of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The following table reflects the components of non-operating income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nWe assess each legal entity in which we hold a variable interest to determine whether consolidation is appropriate at the onset of the relationship and upon certain reconsideration events. We determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in the entity by evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity (\"VOE\") or a variable interest entity (\"VIE\") under GAAP. Assessing whether an entity is a VOE or VIE and if it requires consolidation involves judgment and analysis. Factors considered in this assessment include an entity's purpose and design, a company's ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and whether a company is obligated to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the entity. The standard also requires ongoing assessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. When utilizing the VOE model, controlling financial interest is generally defined as majority ownership of voting interests.\nEconomic income, for periods beginning in and subsequent to January 1, 2019, presents a financial measure of the controlling and non-controlling interests of Manning & Napier Group and excludes from income before provision for income taxes strategic restructuring and transaction costs, net. We define strategic restructuring and transaction costs, net, as items related to our ongoing strategic review focused on the evolution of our distribution strategy and technology initiatives. These include severance-related costs, certain consulting and other professional service fees, lease and other contract termination costs, and gain or loss on sale of a business.\n\nThe following tables reflect the indicated components of our AUM for our portfolios for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n (2) Market appreciation/(depreciation) and other includes investment gains/(losses) on assets under management, the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and net flows from non-sales related activities including net reinvested dividends. \n (1) In light of numerous factors affecting our obligation to make such payments, the timing and amounts of any such actual payments are based on our best estimate as of the end of each period presented, including the ability to realize the expected tax benefits. Actual payments may significantly differ from estimated payments. See Accounting Policies - Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement\u201d for more information. \nEconomic net income is a non-GAAP measure of after-tax operating performance for the controlling and non-controlling interests of Manning & Napier Group and equals the Company's income before provision for income taxes less adjusted\nOn August 30, 2019, the Company sold its wholly-owned subsidiary, PPI, to Manning Partners, LLC, which is wholly-owned by the Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors. The Company received cash proceeds of $3.1 million, and recorded a $2.9 million gain on the sale. Other than the cash proceeds received, the transaction did not have a material impact to the consolidated statements of financial condition.\nRegarding fixed income, performance was good for the year as falling interest rates provided a boost to bond market returns, although we expect low starting yields to create a challenging long-term environment for fixed income investors. Going forward, elevated valuations and slow economic growth are likely to challenge long-run returns. Given today's muted market backdrop, we believe an active investment approach may become an increasingly attractive approach to meeting financial goals and objectives.\nWe make initial seed investments in sponsored investment portfolios to develop new products and services for our clients. The original seed investment may be held in a separately managed account, comprised solely of our investments, or within a mutual fund, where our investment may represent all or only a portion of the total equity invested in the mutual fund. We evaluate our seed investments on a regular basis and consolidate such mutual funds for which we hold a controlling financial interest. When we no longer hold a financial controlling interest, we deconsolidate the fund and classify the remaining investment as either an equity method investment or as equity investments, at fair value, as applicable.\nDistribution and shareholder servicing revenue decreased by $1.9 million, or 15%, to $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was driven primarily by the reduction in mutual fund and collective trust average AUM of 15% for the same period.\nNon-operating income (loss) includes interest expense, interest and dividend income, changes in liability under the tax receivable agreement (\"TRA\") entered into between Manning & Napier and the other holders of Class A units of Manning & Napier Group, gains (losses) related to investment securities sales and changes in values of those investment securities designated as equity investments, at fair value and gain on sale of business.\n________________________\nRevenues\n \u2022 Other operating costs. Other operating costs include accounting, legal and other professional service fees, occupancy and facility costs, travel and entertainment expenses, insurance, market data service expenses and all other miscellaneous costs associated with managing the day-to-day operations of our business.  Non-Operating Income (Loss)\nincome taxes. Adjusted income taxes are estimated assuming the exchange of all outstanding units of Manning & Napier Group into Class A common stock on a one-to-one basis. Therefore, all income of Manning & Napier Group allocated to the units of Manning & Napier Group is treated as if it were allocated to Manning & Napier and represents an estimate of income tax expense at an effective rate of 29.0% and 32.0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, reflecting assumed federal, state and local income taxes.\n \u2022 Distribution, servicing and custody expenses. Distribution, servicing and custody expense represent amounts paid to various intermediaries for distribution, shareholder servicing, administrative servicing and custodial services. These expenses generally increase or decrease in line with changes in our mutual fund and collective investment trust AUM or services performed by these intermediaries. During the first quarter of 2019, we completed the effort, begun in 2017, of restructuring fees across our mutual funds. The financial impacts were a reduction in the management fees on existing business, and an offsetting reduction in related distribution, servicing and custody expenses. Given the overall pressure on fees that all active managers are facing, we believe that bringing our fund fees to a more competitive level will enhance our ability to attract additional assets in the future. \nThese policies and our procedures related to these policies are described in detail below. Please also refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of our accounting policies.\nManning & Napier, Inc. is an independent investment management firm that provides our clients with a broad range of financial solutions and investment strategies. Founded in 1970 and headquartered in Fairport, New York, we serve a diversified client base of high-net-worth individuals and institutions, including 401(k) plans, pension plans, Taft-Hartley plans, endowments and foundations. Our investment strategies offer equity, fixed income and a range of blended asset portfolios by employing traditional and quantitative approaches.\nOur mutual funds and collective investment trusts contributed 45% of our total gross client inflows for the year ended December 31, 2019 and represented 30% of our total AUM as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, our mutual fund and collective investment trust AUM consisted of 68% from blended asset portfolios, 30% from equity portfolios and 2% from fixed income portfolios, compared to 70%, 28% and 2% for blended asset, equity and fixed income portfolios, respectively, as of December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, 59%, 36% and 5% of mutual fund and collective gross client inflows were attributable to blended assets, equity and fixed income portfolios, respectively.\nof the Company's Class A common stock less a market discount and expected expenses, or at the Company's election issue shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis.\nAs a result of Manning & Napier's purchase of Class A units of Manning & Napier Group or exchange for Class A common stock of Manning & Napier for Class A units of Manning & Napier Group and Manning & Napier Group's election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code, we expect to benefit from depreciation and amortization deductions from an increase in tax basis of tangible and intangible assets of Manning & Napier Group. Those deductions allocated to us will be taken into account in reporting our taxable income.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nNoncontrolling Interests\nOur separate accounts contributed 55% of our total gross client inflows for the year ended December 31, 2019 and represented 70% of our total AUM as of December 31, 2019.\n________________________\nOur mutual fund and collective investment trust business is driven by both financial intermediaries, as well as through our wealth management channel. Through our intermediary channel, we are focused on promoting our single-asset class and specialized strategies to our wealth and retirement plan advisors, who wish to use our strategies as a component of a larger portfolio. Additionally, our blended asset portfolios are used by advisors seeking a multi-asset class solution for their retail clients.\nSupplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information\n (1) The increase in interest and dividend income for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 is attributable to an increase in investments, including U.S. Treasury notes and bills, corporate bonds and other short-term investments to optimize cash management opportunities. \n \u2022 the composition of our AUM among various portfolios, vehicles and client types; \nOur Business\nCustodial services revenue decreased by $0.7 million, or 10%, to $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease primarily relates to decreases in our collective investment trust AUM.\n\nNet client outflows of $1.7 billion from our mutual fund and collective investment trusts included gross client inflows of $1.2 billion offset by gross client outflows of $3.0 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross client inflows into our blended asset life cycle vehicles, including both risk based and target date strategies, represented $0.7 billion, or 59%, of mutual fund and collective trust fund gross client inflows during the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross client outflows were predominantly driven by cancellations and withdrawals from defined contribution and institutional relationships. With regard to gross client outflows, $1.9 billion, or 65%, of mutual fund and collective investment trust gross client outflows were from blended asset mutual fund and collective trust products.\nThe review of our investment offerings was focused on eliminating the distraction of sub-scale and underperforming strategies so that the team could continue to focus on generating competitive returns for clients. During 2019, we closed 3 sub-scale or under performing mutual fund offerings and 11 collective investment trusts.\nAll other revenue earned by us is recognized on a GAAP accounting basis as earned per the terms of the specific contract.\n (2) Market appreciation/(depreciation) and other includes investment gains/(losses) on AUM, the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and net flows from non-sales related activities including net reinvested dividends. \nProvision for Income Taxes\nSeparately managed account revenue decreased by $10.8 million, or 11%, to $86.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $97.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is driven primarily by an 8%, or $1.3 billion decrease in our average separately managed account AUM for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. On an annualized basis, our average separately managed account fee for the year ended December 31, 2019 remained consistent at 0.60% when compared to the full year 2018. For both periods our separately managed account standard fees ranged from 0.15% to 1.25% depending upon investment objective and account size. As of December 31, 2019, the concentration of investments in our separately managed account assets was 70% blended assets, 24% equity and 6% fixed income, compared to 65% blended assets, 27% equity and 8% fixed income as of December 31, 2018.\nInvesting Activities\nOperating Expenses\nAs of December 31, 2019, blended portfolios account for 70% of our total AUM at $13.5 billion, consistent with blended portfolio AUM at December 31, 2018. Blended portfolio AUM is similar across both distribution channels, with 53% in wealth management and 47% in institutional and intermediary. Equity portfolios account for 25% of our total AUM, at $5.0 billion, a 9% decrease from December 31, 2018, when equity portfolios were at $5.5 billion. Of equity portfolio AUM, 74% is in the institutional and intermediary channel, and 26% is in the wealth management channel. Fixed income portfolios account for 5% of total AUM at $1.0 billion, a 10% decrease from December 31, 2018, when fixed income assets were $1.1 billion. Consistent with equity portfolio AUM, the majority of fixed income assets come through the institutional and intermediary channel at 72% and 28% of fixed income AUM is in the wealth management channel.\nRevenue Recognition\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of our investment in net assets of acquired companies over the fair value of the underlying identifiable net assets at the dates of acquisition. We attribute all goodwill associated with past acquisitions to our single reporting unit. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit associated with the goodwill to the reporting unit's recorded value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its recorded value an impairment loss will be recorded.\nIn connection with our initial public offering (\"IPO\"), the TRA was entered into between Manning & Napier and the holders of Manning & Napier Group, pursuant to which Manning & Napier is required to pay to such holders 85% of the applicable cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income tax that Manning & Napier actually realizes, or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances, as a result of (i) certain tax attributes of their units sold to Manning & Napier or exchanged (for shares of Class A common stock) and that are created as a result of the sales or exchanges and payments under the TRA and (ii) tax benefits related to imputed interest.\n (2) Represents the fair value of additional cash payments related to our acquisition of Rainier of up to $32.5 million over the three-year period ending December 31, 2019, contingent upon Rainier's achievement of certain financial targets.  We have no material assets other than our ownership of Class A units of Manning & Napier Group and, accordingly, will depend on distributions from Manning & Napier Group to pay taxes, operating expenses, and any dividends we may pay. As managing member of Manning & Napier Group, we will determine the timing and amount of any distributions paid to its members. We intend to cause Manning & Napier Group to distribute cash to its members, including us, in an amount sufficient to cover taxes and operating expenses, including dividends, if any, declared by us. If we do cause Manning & Napier Group to make such distributions, M&N Group Holdings, MNCC and any other holders of units of Manning & Napier Group will be entitled to receive equivalent distributions on a pari passu basis.\n\nCash Flows\nMutual funds and collective investment trust investment management revenue is calculated and earned daily based on AUM. Revenue is presented net of cash rebates and fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds. We also have agreements with third parties who provide recordkeeping and administrative services for employee benefit plans participating in the collective investment trusts. We are acting as an agent on behalf of the employee benefit plan sponsors, therefore, investment management revenue is recorded net of fees paid to third party service providers.\n\nBeginning with the release of our operating results for the third quarter of 2019, as supplemental information we began providing a new non-GAAP measure, economic income. Management uses economic income, economic net income and economic net income per adjusted share as financial measures to evaluate the profitability and efficiency of our business as a whole in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of its operations. Economic income, economic net income and economic net income per adjusted share are not presented in accordance with GAAP.\nOperating Expenses\nIncome Tax Provision\nThrough the institutional and intermediary channel, our representatives promote our portfolios to large institutional clients with which we have direct relationships, as well as consultants. Additionally, we have relationships with middle-market and large market defined contribution plan sponsors seeking to use our life cycle mutual funds and collective investment trusts as default options on their investment menu. In the wealth management channel, we may see additional interest in our mutual funds and collective investment trust strategies through both blended and single-asset class portfolios based on the needs of the clients.\nAssets Under Management\nWith regard to our separate accounts, gross client inflows of $1.5 billion were offset by approximately $4.2 billion of gross client outflows during the year ended December 31, 2019. The $1.5 billion of gross client inflows included $0.7 billion into our blended asset portfolios, $0.7 billion into our equity portfolios and $0.1 billion into fixed income. During the year ended December 31, 2019, 67% of our separate account gross client inflows were derived from our wealth management channel with 58% representing contributions from existing wealth management relationships. Across both channels, gross client outflows were split with 43% withdrawals from existing accounts and 57% representing client cancellations. Included within the $4.2 billion of client outflows during the year ended December 31, 2019 was a cancellation of a Sub-Advisory relationship during the fourth quarter of 2019 of approximately $1.0 billion. Our blended asset and equity portfolios experienced net client outflows of approximately $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. Our separate account clients redeemed assets at a rate of 31% during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to a 24% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The annualized separate account retention rate was 83% for the year ended December 31, 2019 a slight decrease from 86% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n__________________________\nDistribution and shareholder servicing: We receive distribution and servicing fees for providing services to our affiliated mutual funds. Revenue is computed and earned daily based on a percentage of AUM. The performance obligation is a series of services that form part of a single performance obligation satisfied over time. We have agreements with third parties who provide distribution and administrative services for our mutual funds. The agreements are evaluated to determine whether revenue should be reported gross or net of payments to third-party service providers. We control the services provided and act as a principal in the relationship. Therefore, distribution and shareholder servicing revenue is recorded gross of fees paid to third parties.\nInvesting activities provided $3.2 million and used $21.5 million of net cash for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This change was driven by an increase in cash from investing activities of $24.7 million due to our funding of and timing of activity within our investment securities. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we received approximately $3.0 million, net, from the purchase and sale of certain securities for cash management purposes and received approximately $0.1 million of net proceeds from the redemption of certain seeded portfolios during 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we used $21.6 million, net, from the purchase and sale of certain securities for cash management purposes. In addition, we received proceeds from the sale of intangible assets and businesses of approximately $3.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $2.6 million in the same period of 2018. Our purchases of property and equipment were approximately $2.5 million and $2.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe expect the interest and investment components of non-operating income (loss) to fluctuate based on market conditions, the performance of our investments and the overall amount of our investments held by the Company to provide initial cash seeding for product development purposes and short-term investment for cash management opportunities.\n\nOverview\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nHistorically, our cash and liquidity needs have been met primarily through cash generated by our operations. Our current financial condition is highly liquid, with a significant amount of our assets comprised of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and investment securities held by us for the purposes of optimizing short-term cash management and providing initial cash seeding for product development purposes.\nWe commenced a strategic review of our business upon the appointment of our new Chief Executive Officer, Marc Mayer, in early 2019. Our review was comprehensive in nature, and resulted in changes to our overall distribution strategy, our suite of investment offerings, and our operational platform. The objective of this review was to improve financial results for shareholders and investment results for clients by more clearly prioritizing our strengths, eliminating distractions and sub-scale offerings, and increasing productivity across the firm through improved technology.\nResults of Operations\nOur wealth management channel represented 45% our total AUM as of December 31, 2019. Blended portfolios are the most significant portion of wealth management assets, representing 82% of wealth management AUM. Equity and fixed income portfolios represent 15% and 3% respectively, of wealth management AUM.\nAs a result of this strategic review, we incurred approximately $11.1 million of strategic restructuring and transaction costs, excluding the $2.9 million gain on the sale of PPI noted above. These charges consisted of $3.4 million of employee severance costs and $7.7 million of other operating costs, including $6.3 million of charges stemming from the write-off of existing contracts that we will not be utilizing as we move forward with InvestCloud. We will incur additional costs in 2020 relating to implementing the initiatives from this strategic review.\nDistribution, servicing and custody expenses decreased by $5.6 million, or 31%, to $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in expense was driven by a 15% decrease in mutual funds and collective investment trusts average AUM during the year ended December 31, 2019 as well as the completion of the Advisor's mutual fund fee restructure during the first quarter of 2019. As a percentage of mutual fund and collective investment trust average AUM, distribution, servicing and custody expense was 0.20% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 0.25% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWe serve as the investment adviser for the Fund, Exeter Trust Company Collective Investment Trusts and Rainier Multiple Investment Trust. The mutual funds are open-end mutual funds designed to meet the needs of a range of institutional and other investors.The collective investment trusts are for qualified retirement plans, including 401(k) plans. These mutual funds and collective investment trusts comprised $5.8 billion, or 30%, of our AUM as of December 31, 2019. We also serve as the investment advisor to all of our separately managed accounts, managing $13.6 billion, or 70%, of our AUM as of December 31, 2019, including assets managed as a sub-advisor to pooled investment vehicles. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our revenue earned from clients located in the United States was 99% and 98%, respectively.\nCustodial services: Custodial service fees are calculated as a percentage of the client's market value with additional fees charged for certain transactions. For the safeguarding and administrative services that are subject to a percentage of market value fee, our performance obligation is a series of services that form part of a single performance obligation satisfied over time. Revenue for transactions assigned a stand-alone selling price is recognized in the period which the transaction is executed. Custodial service fees are billed monthly in arrears. We have agreements with third parties who provide safeguarding, record keeping and administrative services for their clients. We control the services provided and act as a principal in the relationship. Therefore, custodial service revenue is recorded gross of fees paid to third parties.\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\") and the related rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates or\n (*) Variance not calculable. \n (4) The gain on sale of business during the year ended December 31, 2019 is due to the completion of the sale of PPI on August 30, 2019.  Provision for Income Taxes\nThe following table reflects changes in our AUM for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n \u2022 changes in our variable costs, including incentive compensation and distribution, servicing and custody expenses, which are affected by our investment performance, level of our AUM and revenue; and \n (2) The change in the liability under the tax receivable agreement for the respective periods is driven by a change in our effective tax rate during the year ended December 31, 2018 and a corresponding increase or decrease in the payment of the expected tax benefit under the tax receivable agreement. \nOther operating costs increased by $7.4 million, or 23%, to $39.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $32.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2019 was driven primarily by $6.3 million of expenses recognized during the fourth quarter of 2019 related to our technology upgrade initiatives. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we entered into a contract with a new third-party service provider which will replace an existing license agreement for internal-use software. As a result, we recorded charges of approximately $2.1 million for the impairment of existing internal-use software, $1.0 million for the write-off of associated prepaid license costs, and $3.2 million for future cash obligations under the existing license agreement. The increase in other operating costs over 2018 is also driven by the $2.1 million gain reflected during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the Company's sale of Rainier U.S. mutual funds, which offset other operating costs in the period. As a percentage of revenue, other operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were 29% and 20%, respectively.\n__________________________\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations and other data for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nOur annualized separate account retention rate across all channels was 83% during the year ended December 31, 2019, a small decrease from our historical retention rate, which was 86% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n \u2022 asset-based fee rates and changes in those rates; \nOur review also included an evaluation of our operational and technology platforms. We concluded our existing processes were overly complicated, in large part due to our legacy, internally-developed technology platform. In December 2019, we announced a new partnership with industry leader InvestCloud. The InvestCloud partnership, in conjunction with other technology enhancements, is a critical step in our digital transformation. We estimate the implementation of our upgraded technology platform will occur during the second half of 2021.\nThe composition of our AUM was 70% in separate accounts and 30% in mutual funds and collective investment trusts as of December 31, 2019, a shift from 68% in separate accounts and 32% in mutual funds and collective investment trusts at December 31, 2018. The composition of our AUM across portfolios at December 31, 2019 was 69% in blended assets, 26% in equity, and 5% in fixed income, compared to 67% in blended assets, 27% in equity, and 6% in fixed income at December 31, 2018.\nAccounting policies are an integral part of our financial statements. A thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial condition. Our management has identified the following significant accounting policies that are critical to understanding our business and prospects for future performance, as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and other significant areas that involve management's judgment and estimates.\n \u2022 Compensation and related costs. Employee compensation and related costs represent our largest expense, including employee salaries and benefits, incentive compensation to investment and sales professionals, compensation issued under our long-term incentive plan as well as equity compensation. These costs are affected by changes in the employee headcount, the mix of existing job descriptions, competitive factors, the addition of new skill sets and variations in the level of our AUM and revenues. These costs are also impacted by the number of awards granted under our equity plan and the amount of deferred cash awards granted under our long-term incentive plan. Incentive compensation for our research team considers the cumulative impact of both absolute and relative investment performance over historical time periods, with more weight placed on the recent periods. As such, incentive compensation paid to our research team will vary, in part, based on absolute and relative investment performance. \nWe also obtain separate account business from third parties, including financial advisors or unaffiliated registered investment advisor programs or platforms. During the year ended December 31, 2019, 33% of the total gross client inflows for separate accounts came from financial advisor representatives and registered investment advisor platforms. The institutional and intermediary sales channel collectively represented 44% of our separate account AUM as of December 31, 2019.\n (1) Transfers of client assets between portfolios are included in gross client inflows and gross client outflows. \nWe have enhanced our distribution efforts under the direction of our two new sales heads, with Greg Woodard leading the Wealth Management team and Aaron McGreevy leading the Intermediary and Institutional team. During 2019, the Wealth Management team reviewed our strategy to engage both current clients and prospects on our existing suite of advisory service offerings, as well as to add to our existing team of financial consultants and increase our prospecting efforts. This review of our intermediary and institutional distribution strategy resulted in changes to our territory coverage and servicing efforts in order to more effectively service our existing clients with our small team, while concentrating on geographies with the greatest chances for growth.\nOur operating results are heavily influenced by the absolute returns generated by global financial markets. In addition, an important distinguishing factor is the relative performance of our various investment strategies. All of our investment processes are based on the fundamental belief that active management is the best investment approach for helping clients meet long-term goals and objectives. As an active manager, we regularly maintain a high active share across many of our key strategies, and at times, these strategies experience performance that meaningfully deviates from market benchmarks. When performance is strong, this can cause us to experience sizeable inflows in AUM, and when performance is weak, we can experience outflows in AUM.\nOur separate account business has historically been driven primarily by our wealth management channel, where financial consultants form a relationship with high-net-worth investors, endowments, foundations, and retirement plans. The wealth management sales channel contributed 67% of the total gross client inflows for our separate account business for the year ended December 31, 2019 and represented 56% of our total separate account AUM as of December 31, 2019. We anticipate this channel to continue to be the largest driver of new separate account business going forward, given their high-net-worth and advisory client-type focus.\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2019.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our other financial and operating data:\nAt December 31, 2019, we have recorded a total liability of $17.5 million, representing the payments due to the selling unit holders under the TRA. Payments are anticipated to be made annually commencing from the date of each event that gives rise to the TRA benefits. The actual amount and timing of any payments may vary from this estimate due to a number of factors, including a material change in the relevant tax law or our failure to earn sufficient taxable income to realize all estimated tax benefits. The expected payment obligation assumes no additional uncertain tax positions that would impact the TRAs.\nWe earn custodial service fees for administrative and safeguarding services performed by Exeter Trust Company, our New Hampshire-chartered trust company. Fees are calculated as a percentage of the client's market value with additional fees for certain transactions.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates or assumptions and may have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nThe total AUM decrease of $0.7 billion, or 3%, to $19.5 billion at December 31, 2019 from $20.2 billion at December 31, 2018 was attributable to net client outflows of $4.5 billion, partially offset by $3.8 billion of market appreciation and other changes. Net client outflows consisted of approximately $2.8 billion of net outflows from separate accounts and $1.7 billion from mutual funds and collective investment trusts. By portfolio, the rates of change in AUM from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 consisted of a $0.5 billion, or 9.3% decrease in our equity portfolio, and a $0.1 billion, or 0.4% decrease in our blended asset portfolio.\nIn determining the sufficiency of liquidity and capital resources to fund our business, we regularly monitor our liquidity position, including among other things, cash, working capital, long-term liabilities, lease commitments and operating company distributions.\nWe earn distribution and servicing fees for providing services to our affiliated mutual funds. Revenue is computed and earned daily based on a percentage of AUM.\n \u2022 Level 2-other significant observable inputs (including but not limited to quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment rates, credit risk, etc.); and \nInvestment Management: Investment management fees are computed as a percentage of AUM. Our performance obligation is a series of services that form part of a single performance obligation satisfied over time.\n (1) See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for Manning & Napier's reasons for including these non-GAAP measures in this report and for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures for the periods indicated. \nWhile many of our key strategies achieved competitive relative returns in 2019, we attribute our 2019 net cash outflows to challenging three and five year annualized returns in many of the strategies included in our blended asset portfolios. We believe that our ability to improve cash flows going forward will depend on our ability to sustain the improved investment performance we achieved over the past year and execute on our strategic initiatives focused on gathering and retaining client assets.\n\nOur operating expenses decreased by $4.7 million, or 3%, to $133.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $137.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWe believe cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient over the next twelve months to meet our working capital requirements. Further, we expect that cash on hand, including short-term investments and cash generated by operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.\n\nAs part of our review of sub-scale product offerings, during 2019, we sold our wholly-owned subsidiary Perspective Partners, LLC ( PPI\u201d), an employee benefits software and service provider to plan sponsors, administrators, and participants to Manning Partners, LLC, an entity owned by William Manning, the Chairman of our Board of Directors. We received $3.1 million of cash proceeds and recorded a $2.9 million gain on the sale.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures:\nGlobal equity performance was strong in 2019, with the major gains driven by an easing of several key risks that had been acting as an overhang on markets. Growth in U.S. equities was particularly strong, although international markets experienced solid gains as well. Within the U.S., small-cap stocks slightly outperformed large-cap stocks, and stylistically, growth again outperformed value, continuing a multi-year trend.\n________________________\nThe Company is nearing the completion of the 2020 exchange period whereby eligible Class A units of Manning & Napier Group held by M&N Group Holdings and MNCC may be tendered for exchange. In connection with the exchange, the Company has the ability to pay an amount of cash equal to the number of units exchanged multiplied by the value of one share\nNon-Operating Income (Loss)\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nAssets Under Management\nOur institutional and intermediary channel represented 55% of our total AUM as of December 31, 2019. Blended portfolios are also the largest portion of institutional and intermediary assets at 59% of AUM, followed by equity and fixed income portfolios at 34% and 7%, respectively.\n \u2022 fixed costs, including changes to base compensation, vendor-related costs and investment spending on new products.  Assets Under Management and Investment Performance\n (3) The amount of net gain (loss) on investments held by us, to provide initial cash seeding for product development purposes and to hedge economic exposure to market movements on our deferred compensation plan, will vary depending on the performance and overall amount of our investments. \nManagement judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance that might be required against deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2019, we have not recorded a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. In the event that sufficient taxable income does not result in future years, among other things, a valuation allowance for certain of our deferred tax assets may be required. Because\nManning & Napier, Inc. holds an economic interest of approximately 19.2% in Manning & Napier Group as of December 31, 2019, but as managing member controls all of the business and affairs of Manning & Napier Group. As a result, the Company consolidates the financial results of Manning & Napier Group and records a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of operations represents the portion of earnings attributable to the economic interest in Manning & Napier Group held by the noncontrolling interests.\nGoodwill\nCompensation and related costs decreased by $6.4 million, or 7%, to $81.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $87.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was driven by a 16% reduction in our average workforce and lower variable incentive costs as a result of the reduction in AUM and revenue. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $2.4 million in 2019 from 2018 attributable to the timing and amount of awards granted under our equity and long-term incentive plans. Employee severance costs decreased by $0.7 million to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As a percentage of revenue, compensation and related costs for 2019 were 60%, compared to 54% in 2018.\n (1) Transfers of client assets between portfolios are included in gross client inflows and gross client outflows. \nFinancing Activities\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recent accounting pronouncements,\" included in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, blended asset portfolios represented 51% of the separate account gross client inflows from the wealth management sales channel, while equity and fixed income portfolios represented 45% and 4%, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, blended asset and equity portfolios represented 81% and 15%, respectively, of total wealth management separate account AUM, while our fixed income portfolios were 4%. We expect our focus on individuals, endowments, foundations, and retirement plans to continue to drive interest in our separately managed account investment strategies.\nMutual fund and collective investment trust revenue decreased by $12.1 million, or 29%, to $29.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $41.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was driven primarily by a 15%, or $1.1 billion, decrease in our average mutual fund and collective investment trust AUM for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, coupled with the effects of the mutual fund fee restructure completed in the first quarter of 2019. On an annualized basis, our average fee on mutual fund and collective investment trust products decreased to 0.64% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 0.73% for the full year 2018. This decrease was due primarily to the restructuring of our funds during 2019. For both periods, management fees earned on our mutual fund and collective investment trust management fees ranged from 0.14% to 0.90%, depending on investment strategy. As of December 31, 2019, the concentration of investments in our mutual fund and collective investment trusts was 68% blended assets, 30% equity and 2% fixed income, compared to 70% blended assets, 28% equity and 2% fixed income as of December 31, 2018.\n\nThe following tables reflect the indicated components of our AUM for our investment vehicles for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nWe serve as the investment adviser for the Fund, Exeter Trust Company Collective Investment Trusts ( CIT\u201d) and Rainier Multiple Investment Trust, which are legal entities, the business and affairs of which are managed by their respective boards of directors. As a result, each of these entities is a VOE. We hold, in limited cases, direct investments in a fund (which are made on the same terms as are available to other investors) and consolidate each of these entities where it has a controlling financial interest or a majority voting interest.\n \u2022 Level 1-observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical securities; \nThe annual test of goodwill indicated that there were no facts or circumstances occurring in 2019 suggesting possible impairment. The impairment tests included certain underlying key assumptions regarding future overall market trends and our operating performance. If actual future market results and our operating performance vary unfavorably to those included in our financial forecast, we may be subject to impairment charges related to its goodwill.", "item_7_text": "As of December 31, 2019, Manning & Napier holds an economic interest of approximately 19.2% in Manning & Napier Group, but as managing member controls all of the business and affairs of Manning & Napier Group. As a result, we consolidate the financial results of Manning & Napier Group and record a noncontrolling interest on our consolidated statements of financial condition with respect to the remaining economic interest in Manning & Napier Group held by M&N Group Holdings and MNCC.\nPayments Pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement\nFinancing activities used $10.6 million and $20.0 million of net cash for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This overall $9.4 million decrease in net cash used in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily the result of a reduction in distributions to noncontrolling interests of $7.2 million and dividends paid on Class A common stock of $3.6 million driven by lower net income. These decreases in cash used were partially offset by a $1.1 million increase in cash used in 2019 for the purchase of Class A units of Manning & Napier Group pursuant to the exchange agreement entered into at the time of our IPO of $3.1 million in 2019 compared to $1.9 million in 2018. This increase was due to a higher number of units exchanged in 2019.\n (2) Market appreciation/(depreciation) and other includes investment gains/(losses) on assets under management, the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and net flows from non-sales related activities including net reinvested dividends. \nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management fees earned from providing advisory services to separately managed accounts and to mutual funds and collective investment trusts-including those offered by Manning & Napier Advisors, LLC (\"MNA\"), the Manning & Napier Fund, Inc.(the \"Fund\"), Exeter Trust Company, and Rainier Investment Management, LLC (\"Rainier\").\nThe following table sets forth certain key financial data relating to our liquidity and capital resources as of December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nConsolidation\nOur largest operating expenses are employee compensation and related costs, and to a lesser degree, distribution, servicing and custody expenses, discussed further below, with a significant portion of these expenses varying in a direct relationship to our absolute and relative investment management performance, as well as AUM and revenues. We review our operating expenses in relation to the investment market environment and changes in our revenues. However, we are generally willing to make expenditures as necessary, even when faced with declining rates of growth in revenues in order to support our investment products, our client service levels, strategic initiatives and our long-term value.\n__________________________\nOverview\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized.\nEconomic net income per adjusted share is equal to economic net income divided by the total number of adjusted Class A common shares outstanding. The number of adjusted Class A common shares outstanding for all periods presented is determined by assuming the weighted average exchangeable units of Manning & Napier Group, weighted average unvested restricted stock unit, weighted average unvested restricted stock awards and weighted average vested stock options are converted into the Company's outstanding Class A common stock as of the respective reporting date, on a one-to-one basis. The Company's management uses economic net income, among other financial data, to determine the earnings available to distribute as dividends to holders of its Class A common stock and to the holders of the units of Manning & Napier Group.\n (1) Transfers of client assets between portfolios are included in gross client inflows and gross client outflows. \nThe Company is comprised of entities that have elected to be treated as either a limited liability company (\"LLC\") or a C-Corporation.\u201d As such, the entities functioning as LLC's are not liable for or able to benefit from U.S. federal or most state and local income taxes on their earnings, and their earnings (losses) will be included in the personal income tax returns of each entity's unit holders. The entities functioning as C-Corporations are liable for or able to benefit from U.S. federal and state and local income taxes on their earnings and losses, respectively.\n \u2022 Level 3-significant unobservable inputs (including our own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments). \nThe tax provision decreased by $2.2 million, to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The change was primarily driven by a decrease in taxable earnings as compared to the prior year.\nSeparately managed accounts are paid in advance, typically for a semi-annual or quarterly period, or in arrears, typically for a monthly or quarterly period. When investment management fees are paid in advance, we defer the revenue as a contract liability and recognize it over the applicable period. When investment management fees are paid in arrears, we estimate revenue and record a contract asset (accrued accounts receivable) based on AUM as of the most recent month end date.\nthe determination of our annual income tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates, it is likely that the actual results will vary from those recorded in our financial statements. Hence, we recognize additions to and reductions in income tax expense during a reporting period that pertains to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and our actual tax returns and tax audits are completed.\nMarket Developments\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, we completed the effort to restructure fees for many of our mutual fund and collective trust vehicles. The impacts on our overall revenue margins and operating expenses are described below in the discussion of results for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOperating activities provided $15.0 million and $22.8 million of net cash for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This overall $7.9 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was due to a decrease in net income after adjustment for non-cash items of approximately $13.9 million, which was driven by lower revenues resulting primarily from the decrease in our average AUM. This was partially offset by an overall increase of approximately $6.1 million in operating assets and liabilities.\n\nDuring 2019, we changed our distribution strategy following a business review to better capitalize on our strengths. As part of this change, we have adjusted our sales efforts to more distinctly separate the clients to which we deliver holistic solutions, including high-net-worth families, endowments and foundations, and small and mid-sized business, from our Institutional and Intermediary clients, including third party advisors, platforms and consultants, as well as larger institutions and Taft-Hartley clients. The table below reflects the estimated composition of our assets under management as of December 31, 2019, by sales channel and investment portfolio:\nInvestors should consider the non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, our non-GAAP measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures.\nThe table below summarizes the approximate amount of AUM for the periods indicated for which fair value is measured based on Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3:\nOur Solutions\n\nSubstantially all our AUM is valued by independent pricing services based upon observable market prices or inputs, and we believe market risk is the most significant risk underlying valuation of our AUM, as discussed in this Form 10-K under Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d.\nBelow is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\nOur revenues primarily consist of investment management fees earned from managing our clients' AUM. We earn our investment management fees as a percentage of our clients' AUM either as of a specified date or on a daily basis. Our investment management fees can fluctuate based on the average fee rate for our investment management products, which are affected by the composition of our AUM among various portfolios and investment vehicles.\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Operating activities consist primarily of net income subject to adjustments for changes in operating assets and liabilities, equity-based compensation expense, changes in the liability under the TRA, deferred income tax expense, gain on sale of business and of intangible assets, and depreciation and amortization. Investing activities consist primarily of the purchase and sale of investments for the purpose of providing initial cash seeding for product development purposes and cash management purposes, gain on sale of intangible assets, gain on sale of business and purchases of property and equipment. Financing activities consist primarily of distributions to noncontrolling interests, dividends paid on our Class A common stock, and purchases of Class A units held by the noncontrolling interests of Manning & Napier Group.\n________________________\n\nIn addition, other components impacting our operating results include:\nBusiness Review\nBecause the majority of our revenues are earned based on AUM that has been determined using fair value methods and since market appreciation/depreciation has a significant impact on our revenue, we have presented our AUM using the GAAP framework for measuring fair value. A fair value hierarchy is provided that gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The following three-tier fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value:\nOur assets under management (\"AUM\") were $19.5 billion as of December 31, 2019. The composition of our AUM by vehicle and portfolio is set forth in the table below:\n\nTo provide investors with greater insight into operating results, promote transparency, facilitate comparison of period-to-period results, and to allow a more comprehensive understanding of information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, we supplement our consolidated statements of operations presented on a GAAP basis with non-GAAP financial measures of earnings.\nRevenues\nWe also have relationships with consultants and manager research teams at platforms in order to distribute our funds within advisory programs, or through placement on platforms' approved lists of funds. To facilitate our relationships with intermediaries, we currently have approximately 245 dealer relationships. These relationships are important to our retail business as well as our 401(k) life cycle and institutional business.\nOur separate accounts are primarily distributed through our wealth management sales channel, where our financial consultants form relationships with high-net-worth individuals, endowments, foundations, and retirement plans. To a lesser extent, we also obtain a portion of our separate account distribution via third parties, either through our intermediary sales channel where national brokerage firm representatives or independent financial advisors select our separate account strategies for their clients, or through our platform/sub-advisor relationships, where unaffiliated registered investment advisors approve our strategies for their product platforms. Our separate account strategies are a primary driver of our blended asset portfolios for high-net-worth, middle market institutional clients and financial intermediaries. In contrast, larger institutions and unaffiliated registered investment advisor platforms are a driver of our separate account equity portfolios.\nOperating Activities\nComponents of Results of Operations\nAccounting Policies and Estimates\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNew separate account business through the institutional and intermediary sales channel flowed into both our blended asset and equity portfolios. During the year ended December 31, 2019, blended asset, equity, and fixed income portfolios represented 45%, 45%, and 10%, respectively, of the separate account gross client inflows from the institutional and intermediary sales channel. As of December 31, 2019, 59% of our total AUM derived from institutions and intermediaries was allocated to blended asset portfolios, with 34% allocated to equity and 7% allocated to fixed income. We expect that equity and fixed income portfolios may see additional interest from intermediaries over time as more advisors structure a multi-strategy portfolio for their clients.\nOur mutual funds and collective investment trusts are distributed through financial intermediaries, including brokers, financial advisors, retirement plan advisors and platform relationships. We also distribute our mutual fund and collective investment trusts through our institutional representatives, particularly within the defined contribution, Taft-Hartley, and institutional marketplace. Our mutual fund and collective investment trust strategies are an important driver of our blended asset class and single asset class portfolios.\n(1) Strategic restructuring and transaction costs, net, are included in the following financial statement line items of our Consolidated Statements of Operations:\nNon-operating income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $7.6 million, an increase of $5.3 million, from non-operating income of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The following table reflects the components of non-operating income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nWe assess each legal entity in which we hold a variable interest to determine whether consolidation is appropriate at the onset of the relationship and upon certain reconsideration events. We determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in the entity by evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity (\"VOE\") or a variable interest entity (\"VIE\") under GAAP. Assessing whether an entity is a VOE or VIE and if it requires consolidation involves judgment and analysis. Factors considered in this assessment include an entity's purpose and design, a company's ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and whether a company is obligated to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the entity. The standard also requires ongoing assessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. When utilizing the VOE model, controlling financial interest is generally defined as majority ownership of voting interests.\nEconomic income, for periods beginning in and subsequent to January 1, 2019, presents a financial measure of the controlling and non-controlling interests of Manning & Napier Group and excludes from income before provision for income taxes strategic restructuring and transaction costs, net. We define strategic restructuring and transaction costs, net, as items related to our ongoing strategic review focused on the evolution of our distribution strategy and technology initiatives. These include severance-related costs, certain consulting and other professional service fees, lease and other contract termination costs, and gain or loss on sale of a business.\n\nThe following tables reflect the indicated components of our AUM for our portfolios for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n (2) Market appreciation/(depreciation) and other includes investment gains/(losses) on assets under management, the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and net flows from non-sales related activities including net reinvested dividends. \n (1) In light of numerous factors affecting our obligation to make such payments, the timing and amounts of any such actual payments are based on our best estimate as of the end of each period presented, including the ability to realize the expected tax benefits. Actual payments may significantly differ from estimated payments. See Accounting Policies - Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement\u201d for more information. \nEconomic net income is a non-GAAP measure of after-tax operating performance for the controlling and non-controlling interests of Manning & Napier Group and equals the Company's income before provision for income taxes less adjusted\nOn August 30, 2019, the Company sold its wholly-owned subsidiary, PPI, to Manning Partners, LLC, which is wholly-owned by the Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors. The Company received cash proceeds of $3.1 million, and recorded a $2.9 million gain on the sale. Other than the cash proceeds received, the transaction did not have a material impact to the consolidated statements of financial condition.\nRegarding fixed income, performance was good for the year as falling interest rates provided a boost to bond market returns, although we expect low starting yields to create a challenging long-term environment for fixed income investors. Going forward, elevated valuations and slow economic growth are likely to challenge long-run returns. Given today's muted market backdrop, we believe an active investment approach may become an increasingly attractive approach to meeting financial goals and objectives.\nWe make initial seed investments in sponsored investment portfolios to develop new products and services for our clients. The original seed investment may be held in a separately managed account, comprised solely of our investments, or within a mutual fund, where our investment may represent all or only a portion of the total equity invested in the mutual fund. We evaluate our seed investments on a regular basis and consolidate such mutual funds for which we hold a controlling financial interest. When we no longer hold a financial controlling interest, we deconsolidate the fund and classify the remaining investment as either an equity method investment or as equity investments, at fair value, as applicable.\nDistribution and shareholder servicing revenue decreased by $1.9 million, or 15%, to $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was driven primarily by the reduction in mutual fund and collective trust average AUM of 15% for the same period.\nNon-operating income (loss) includes interest expense, interest and dividend income, changes in liability under the tax receivable agreement (\"TRA\") entered into between Manning & Napier and the other holders of Class A units of Manning & Napier Group, gains (losses) related to investment securities sales and changes in values of those investment securities designated as equity investments, at fair value and gain on sale of business.\n________________________\nRevenues\n \u2022 Other operating costs. Other operating costs include accounting, legal and other professional service fees, occupancy and facility costs, travel and entertainment expenses, insurance, market data service expenses and all other miscellaneous costs associated with managing the day-to-day operations of our business.  Non-Operating Income (Loss)\nincome taxes. Adjusted income taxes are estimated assuming the exchange of all outstanding units of Manning & Napier Group into Class A common stock on a one-to-one basis. Therefore, all income of Manning & Napier Group allocated to the units of Manning & Napier Group is treated as if it were allocated to Manning & Napier and represents an estimate of income tax expense at an effective rate of 29.0% and 32.0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, reflecting assumed federal, state and local income taxes.\n \u2022 Distribution, servicing and custody expenses. Distribution, servicing and custody expense represent amounts paid to various intermediaries for distribution, shareholder servicing, administrative servicing and custodial services. These expenses generally increase or decrease in line with changes in our mutual fund and collective investment trust AUM or services performed by these intermediaries. During the first quarter of 2019, we completed the effort, begun in 2017, of restructuring fees across our mutual funds. The financial impacts were a reduction in the management fees on existing business, and an offsetting reduction in related distribution, servicing and custody expenses. Given the overall pressure on fees that all active managers are facing, we believe that bringing our fund fees to a more competitive level will enhance our ability to attract additional assets in the future. \nThese policies and our procedures related to these policies are described in detail below. Please also refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of our accounting policies.\nManning & Napier, Inc. is an independent investment management firm that provides our clients with a broad range of financial solutions and investment strategies. Founded in 1970 and headquartered in Fairport, New York, we serve a diversified client base of high-net-worth individuals and institutions, including 401(k) plans, pension plans, Taft-Hartley plans, endowments and foundations. Our investment strategies offer equity, fixed income and a range of blended asset portfolios by employing traditional and quantitative approaches.\nOur mutual funds and collective investment trusts contributed 45% of our total gross client inflows for the year ended December 31, 2019 and represented 30% of our total AUM as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, our mutual fund and collective investment trust AUM consisted of 68% from blended asset portfolios, 30% from equity portfolios and 2% from fixed income portfolios, compared to 70%, 28% and 2% for blended asset, equity and fixed income portfolios, respectively, as of December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, 59%, 36% and 5% of mutual fund and collective gross client inflows were attributable to blended assets, equity and fixed income portfolios, respectively.\nof the Company's Class A common stock less a market discount and expected expenses, or at the Company's election issue shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis.\nAs a result of Manning & Napier's purchase of Class A units of Manning & Napier Group or exchange for Class A common stock of Manning & Napier for Class A units of Manning & Napier Group and Manning & Napier Group's election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code, we expect to benefit from depreciation and amortization deductions from an increase in tax basis of tangible and intangible assets of Manning & Napier Group. Those deductions allocated to us will be taken into account in reporting our taxable income.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nNoncontrolling Interests\nOur separate accounts contributed 55% of our total gross client inflows for the year ended December 31, 2019 and represented 70% of our total AUM as of December 31, 2019.\n________________________\nOur mutual fund and collective investment trust business is driven by both financial intermediaries, as well as through our wealth management channel. Through our intermediary channel, we are focused on promoting our single-asset class and specialized strategies to our wealth and retirement plan advisors, who wish to use our strategies as a component of a larger portfolio. Additionally, our blended asset portfolios are used by advisors seeking a multi-asset class solution for their retail clients.\nSupplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information\n (1) The increase in interest and dividend income for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 is attributable to an increase in investments, including U.S. Treasury notes and bills, corporate bonds and other short-term investments to optimize cash management opportunities. \n \u2022 the composition of our AUM among various portfolios, vehicles and client types; \nOur Business\nCustodial services revenue decreased by $0.7 million, or 10%, to $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease primarily relates to decreases in our collective investment trust AUM.\n\nNet client outflows of $1.7 billion from our mutual fund and collective investment trusts included gross client inflows of $1.2 billion offset by gross client outflows of $3.0 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross client inflows into our blended asset life cycle vehicles, including both risk based and target date strategies, represented $0.7 billion, or 59%, of mutual fund and collective trust fund gross client inflows during the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross client outflows were predominantly driven by cancellations and withdrawals from defined contribution and institutional relationships. With regard to gross client outflows, $1.9 billion, or 65%, of mutual fund and collective investment trust gross client outflows were from blended asset mutual fund and collective trust products.\nThe review of our investment offerings was focused on eliminating the distraction of sub-scale and underperforming strategies so that the team could continue to focus on generating competitive returns for clients. During 2019, we closed 3 sub-scale or under performing mutual fund offerings and 11 collective investment trusts.\nAll other revenue earned by us is recognized on a GAAP accounting basis as earned per the terms of the specific contract.\n (2) Market appreciation/(depreciation) and other includes investment gains/(losses) on AUM, the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and net flows from non-sales related activities including net reinvested dividends. \nProvision for Income Taxes\nSeparately managed account revenue decreased by $10.8 million, or 11%, to $86.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $97.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is driven primarily by an 8%, or $1.3 billion decrease in our average separately managed account AUM for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. On an annualized basis, our average separately managed account fee for the year ended December 31, 2019 remained consistent at 0.60% when compared to the full year 2018. For both periods our separately managed account standard fees ranged from 0.15% to 1.25% depending upon investment objective and account size. As of December 31, 2019, the concentration of investments in our separately managed account assets was 70% blended assets, 24% equity and 6% fixed income, compared to 65% blended assets, 27% equity and 8% fixed income as of December 31, 2018.\nInvesting Activities\nOperating Expenses\nAs of December 31, 2019, blended portfolios account for 70% of our total AUM at $13.5 billion, consistent with blended portfolio AUM at December 31, 2018. Blended portfolio AUM is similar across both distribution channels, with 53% in wealth management and 47% in institutional and intermediary. Equity portfolios account for 25% of our total AUM, at $5.0 billion, a 9% decrease from December 31, 2018, when equity portfolios were at $5.5 billion. Of equity portfolio AUM, 74% is in the institutional and intermediary channel, and 26% is in the wealth management channel. Fixed income portfolios account for 5% of total AUM at $1.0 billion, a 10% decrease from December 31, 2018, when fixed income assets were $1.1 billion. Consistent with equity portfolio AUM, the majority of fixed income assets come through the institutional and intermediary channel at 72% and 28% of fixed income AUM is in the wealth management channel.\nRevenue Recognition\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of our investment in net assets of acquired companies over the fair value of the underlying identifiable net assets at the dates of acquisition. We attribute all goodwill associated with past acquisitions to our single reporting unit. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit associated with the goodwill to the reporting unit's recorded value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its recorded value an impairment loss will be recorded.\nIn connection with our initial public offering (\"IPO\"), the TRA was entered into between Manning & Napier and the holders of Manning & Napier Group, pursuant to which Manning & Napier is required to pay to such holders 85% of the applicable cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income tax that Manning & Napier actually realizes, or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances, as a result of (i) certain tax attributes of their units sold to Manning & Napier or exchanged (for shares of Class A common stock) and that are created as a result of the sales or exchanges and payments under the TRA and (ii) tax benefits related to imputed interest.\n (2) Represents the fair value of additional cash payments related to our acquisition of Rainier of up to $32.5 million over the three-year period ending December 31, 2019, contingent upon Rainier's achievement of certain financial targets.  We have no material assets other than our ownership of Class A units of Manning & Napier Group and, accordingly, will depend on distributions from Manning & Napier Group to pay taxes, operating expenses, and any dividends we may pay. As managing member of Manning & Napier Group, we will determine the timing and amount of any distributions paid to its members. We intend to cause Manning & Napier Group to distribute cash to its members, including us, in an amount sufficient to cover taxes and operating expenses, including dividends, if any, declared by us. If we do cause Manning & Napier Group to make such distributions, M&N Group Holdings, MNCC and any other holders of units of Manning & Napier Group will be entitled to receive equivalent distributions on a pari passu basis.\n\nCash Flows\nMutual funds and collective investment trust investment management revenue is calculated and earned daily based on AUM. Revenue is presented net of cash rebates and fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds. We also have agreements with third parties who provide recordkeeping and administrative services for employee benefit plans participating in the collective investment trusts. We are acting as an agent on behalf of the employee benefit plan sponsors, therefore, investment management revenue is recorded net of fees paid to third party service providers.\n\nBeginning with the release of our operating results for the third quarter of 2019, as supplemental information we began providing a new non-GAAP measure, economic income. Management uses economic income, economic net income and economic net income per adjusted share as financial measures to evaluate the profitability and efficiency of our business as a whole in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of its operations. Economic income, economic net income and economic net income per adjusted share are not presented in accordance with GAAP.\nOperating Expenses\nIncome Tax Provision\nThrough the institutional and intermediary channel, our representatives promote our portfolios to large institutional clients with which we have direct relationships, as well as consultants. Additionally, we have relationships with middle-market and large market defined contribution plan sponsors seeking to use our life cycle mutual funds and collective investment trusts as default options on their investment menu. In the wealth management channel, we may see additional interest in our mutual funds and collective investment trust strategies through both blended and single-asset class portfolios based on the needs of the clients.\nAssets Under Management\nWith regard to our separate accounts, gross client inflows of $1.5 billion were offset by approximately $4.2 billion of gross client outflows during the year ended December 31, 2019. The $1.5 billion of gross client inflows included $0.7 billion into our blended asset portfolios, $0.7 billion into our equity portfolios and $0.1 billion into fixed income. During the year ended December 31, 2019, 67% of our separate account gross client inflows were derived from our wealth management channel with 58% representing contributions from existing wealth management relationships. Across both channels, gross client outflows were split with 43% withdrawals from existing accounts and 57% representing client cancellations. Included within the $4.2 billion of client outflows during the year ended December 31, 2019 was a cancellation of a Sub-Advisory relationship during the fourth quarter of 2019 of approximately $1.0 billion. Our blended asset and equity portfolios experienced net client outflows of approximately $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. Our separate account clients redeemed assets at a rate of 31% during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to a 24% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The annualized separate account retention rate was 83% for the year ended December 31, 2019 a slight decrease from 86% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n__________________________\nDistribution and shareholder servicing: We receive distribution and servicing fees for providing services to our affiliated mutual funds. Revenue is computed and earned daily based on a percentage of AUM. The performance obligation is a series of services that form part of a single performance obligation satisfied over time. We have agreements with third parties who provide distribution and administrative services for our mutual funds. The agreements are evaluated to determine whether revenue should be reported gross or net of payments to third-party service providers. We control the services provided and act as a principal in the relationship. Therefore, distribution and shareholder servicing revenue is recorded gross of fees paid to third parties.\nInvesting activities provided $3.2 million and used $21.5 million of net cash for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This change was driven by an increase in cash from investing activities of $24.7 million due to our funding of and timing of activity within our investment securities. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we received approximately $3.0 million, net, from the purchase and sale of certain securities for cash management purposes and received approximately $0.1 million of net proceeds from the redemption of certain seeded portfolios during 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we used $21.6 million, net, from the purchase and sale of certain securities for cash management purposes. In addition, we received proceeds from the sale of intangible assets and businesses of approximately $3.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $2.6 million in the same period of 2018. Our purchases of property and equipment were approximately $2.5 million and $2.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe expect the interest and investment components of non-operating income (loss) to fluctuate based on market conditions, the performance of our investments and the overall amount of our investments held by the Company to provide initial cash seeding for product development purposes and short-term investment for cash management opportunities.\n\nOverview\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nHistorically, our cash and liquidity needs have been met primarily through cash generated by our operations. Our current financial condition is highly liquid, with a significant amount of our assets comprised of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and investment securities held by us for the purposes of optimizing short-term cash management and providing initial cash seeding for product development purposes.\nWe commenced a strategic review of our business upon the appointment of our new Chief Executive Officer, Marc Mayer, in early 2019. Our review was comprehensive in nature, and resulted in changes to our overall distribution strategy, our suite of investment offerings, and our operational platform. The objective of this review was to improve financial results for shareholders and investment results for clients by more clearly prioritizing our strengths, eliminating distractions and sub-scale offerings, and increasing productivity across the firm through improved technology.\nResults of Operations\nOur wealth management channel represented 45% our total AUM as of December 31, 2019. Blended portfolios are the most significant portion of wealth management assets, representing 82% of wealth management AUM. Equity and fixed income portfolios represent 15% and 3% respectively, of wealth management AUM.\nAs a result of this strategic review, we incurred approximately $11.1 million of strategic restructuring and transaction costs, excluding the $2.9 million gain on the sale of PPI noted above. These charges consisted of $3.4 million of employee severance costs and $7.7 million of other operating costs, including $6.3 million of charges stemming from the write-off of existing contracts that we will not be utilizing as we move forward with InvestCloud. We will incur additional costs in 2020 relating to implementing the initiatives from this strategic review.\nDistribution, servicing and custody expenses decreased by $5.6 million, or 31%, to $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in expense was driven by a 15% decrease in mutual funds and collective investment trusts average AUM during the year ended December 31, 2019 as well as the completion of the Advisor's mutual fund fee restructure during the first quarter of 2019. As a percentage of mutual fund and collective investment trust average AUM, distribution, servicing and custody expense was 0.20% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 0.25% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWe serve as the investment adviser for the Fund, Exeter Trust Company Collective Investment Trusts and Rainier Multiple Investment Trust. The mutual funds are open-end mutual funds designed to meet the needs of a range of institutional and other investors.The collective investment trusts are for qualified retirement plans, including 401(k) plans. These mutual funds and collective investment trusts comprised $5.8 billion, or 30%, of our AUM as of December 31, 2019. We also serve as the investment advisor to all of our separately managed accounts, managing $13.6 billion, or 70%, of our AUM as of December 31, 2019, including assets managed as a sub-advisor to pooled investment vehicles. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our revenue earned from clients located in the United States was 99% and 98%, respectively.\nCustodial services: Custodial service fees are calculated as a percentage of the client's market value with additional fees charged for certain transactions. For the safeguarding and administrative services that are subject to a percentage of market value fee, our performance obligation is a series of services that form part of a single performance obligation satisfied over time. Revenue for transactions assigned a stand-alone selling price is recognized in the period which the transaction is executed. Custodial service fees are billed monthly in arrears. We have agreements with third parties who provide safeguarding, record keeping and administrative services for their clients. We control the services provided and act as a principal in the relationship. Therefore, custodial service revenue is recorded gross of fees paid to third parties.\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\") and the related rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates or\n (*) Variance not calculable. \n (4) The gain on sale of business during the year ended December 31, 2019 is due to the completion of the sale of PPI on August 30, 2019.  Provision for Income Taxes\nThe following table reflects changes in our AUM for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n \u2022 changes in our variable costs, including incentive compensation and distribution, servicing and custody expenses, which are affected by our investment performance, level of our AUM and revenue; and \n (2) The change in the liability under the tax receivable agreement for the respective periods is driven by a change in our effective tax rate during the year ended December 31, 2018 and a corresponding increase or decrease in the payment of the expected tax benefit under the tax receivable agreement. \nOther operating costs increased by $7.4 million, or 23%, to $39.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $32.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2019 was driven primarily by $6.3 million of expenses recognized during the fourth quarter of 2019 related to our technology upgrade initiatives. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we entered into a contract with a new third-party service provider which will replace an existing license agreement for internal-use software. As a result, we recorded charges of approximately $2.1 million for the impairment of existing internal-use software, $1.0 million for the write-off of associated prepaid license costs, and $3.2 million for future cash obligations under the existing license agreement. The increase in other operating costs over 2018 is also driven by the $2.1 million gain reflected during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the Company's sale of Rainier U.S. mutual funds, which offset other operating costs in the period. As a percentage of revenue, other operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were 29% and 20%, respectively.\n__________________________\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations and other data for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nOur annualized separate account retention rate across all channels was 83% during the year ended December 31, 2019, a small decrease from our historical retention rate, which was 86% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n \u2022 asset-based fee rates and changes in those rates; \nOur review also included an evaluation of our operational and technology platforms. We concluded our existing processes were overly complicated, in large part due to our legacy, internally-developed technology platform. In December 2019, we announced a new partnership with industry leader InvestCloud. The InvestCloud partnership, in conjunction with other technology enhancements, is a critical step in our digital transformation. We estimate the implementation of our upgraded technology platform will occur during the second half of 2021.\nThe composition of our AUM was 70% in separate accounts and 30% in mutual funds and collective investment trusts as of December 31, 2019, a shift from 68% in separate accounts and 32% in mutual funds and collective investment trusts at December 31, 2018. The composition of our AUM across portfolios at December 31, 2019 was 69% in blended assets, 26% in equity, and 5% in fixed income, compared to 67% in blended assets, 27% in equity, and 6% in fixed income at December 31, 2018.\nAccounting policies are an integral part of our financial statements. A thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial condition. Our management has identified the following significant accounting policies that are critical to understanding our business and prospects for future performance, as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and other significant areas that involve management's judgment and estimates.\n \u2022 Compensation and related costs. Employee compensation and related costs represent our largest expense, including employee salaries and benefits, incentive compensation to investment and sales professionals, compensation issued under our long-term incentive plan as well as equity compensation. These costs are affected by changes in the employee headcount, the mix of existing job descriptions, competitive factors, the addition of new skill sets and variations in the level of our AUM and revenues. These costs are also impacted by the number of awards granted under our equity plan and the amount of deferred cash awards granted under our long-term incentive plan. Incentive compensation for our research team considers the cumulative impact of both absolute and relative investment performance over historical time periods, with more weight placed on the recent periods. As such, incentive compensation paid to our research team will vary, in part, based on absolute and relative investment performance. \nWe also obtain separate account business from third parties, including financial advisors or unaffiliated registered investment advisor programs or platforms. During the year ended December 31, 2019, 33% of the total gross client inflows for separate accounts came from financial advisor representatives and registered investment advisor platforms. The institutional and intermediary sales channel collectively represented 44% of our separate account AUM as of December 31, 2019.\n (1) Transfers of client assets between portfolios are included in gross client inflows and gross client outflows. \nWe have enhanced our distribution efforts under the direction of our two new sales heads, with Greg Woodard leading the Wealth Management team and Aaron McGreevy leading the Intermediary and Institutional team. During 2019, the Wealth Management team reviewed our strategy to engage both current clients and prospects on our existing suite of advisory service offerings, as well as to add to our existing team of financial consultants and increase our prospecting efforts. This review of our intermediary and institutional distribution strategy resulted in changes to our territory coverage and servicing efforts in order to more effectively service our existing clients with our small team, while concentrating on geographies with the greatest chances for growth.\nOur operating results are heavily influenced by the absolute returns generated by global financial markets. In addition, an important distinguishing factor is the relative performance of our various investment strategies. All of our investment processes are based on the fundamental belief that active management is the best investment approach for helping clients meet long-term goals and objectives. As an active manager, we regularly maintain a high active share across many of our key strategies, and at times, these strategies experience performance that meaningfully deviates from market benchmarks. When performance is strong, this can cause us to experience sizeable inflows in AUM, and when performance is weak, we can experience outflows in AUM.\nOur separate account business has historically been driven primarily by our wealth management channel, where financial consultants form a relationship with high-net-worth investors, endowments, foundations, and retirement plans. The wealth management sales channel contributed 67% of the total gross client inflows for our separate account business for the year ended December 31, 2019 and represented 56% of our total separate account AUM as of December 31, 2019. We anticipate this channel to continue to be the largest driver of new separate account business going forward, given their high-net-worth and advisory client-type focus.\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2019.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our other financial and operating data:\nAt December 31, 2019, we have recorded a total liability of $17.5 million, representing the payments due to the selling unit holders under the TRA. Payments are anticipated to be made annually commencing from the date of each event that gives rise to the TRA benefits. The actual amount and timing of any payments may vary from this estimate due to a number of factors, including a material change in the relevant tax law or our failure to earn sufficient taxable income to realize all estimated tax benefits. The expected payment obligation assumes no additional uncertain tax positions that would impact the TRAs.\nWe earn custodial service fees for administrative and safeguarding services performed by Exeter Trust Company, our New Hampshire-chartered trust company. Fees are calculated as a percentage of the client's market value with additional fees for certain transactions.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates or assumptions and may have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nThe total AUM decrease of $0.7 billion, or 3%, to $19.5 billion at December 31, 2019 from $20.2 billion at December 31, 2018 was attributable to net client outflows of $4.5 billion, partially offset by $3.8 billion of market appreciation and other changes. Net client outflows consisted of approximately $2.8 billion of net outflows from separate accounts and $1.7 billion from mutual funds and collective investment trusts. By portfolio, the rates of change in AUM from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 consisted of a $0.5 billion, or 9.3% decrease in our equity portfolio, and a $0.1 billion, or 0.4% decrease in our blended asset portfolio.\nIn determining the sufficiency of liquidity and capital resources to fund our business, we regularly monitor our liquidity position, including among other things, cash, working capital, long-term liabilities, lease commitments and operating company distributions.\nWe earn distribution and servicing fees for providing services to our affiliated mutual funds. Revenue is computed and earned daily based on a percentage of AUM.\n \u2022 Level 2-other significant observable inputs (including but not limited to quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment rates, credit risk, etc.); and \nInvestment Management: Investment management fees are computed as a percentage of AUM. Our performance obligation is a series of services that form part of a single performance obligation satisfied over time.\n (1) See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for Manning & Napier's reasons for including these non-GAAP measures in this report and for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures for the periods indicated. \nWhile many of our key strategies achieved competitive relative returns in 2019, we attribute our 2019 net cash outflows to challenging three and five year annualized returns in many of the strategies included in our blended asset portfolios. We believe that our ability to improve cash flows going forward will depend on our ability to sustain the improved investment performance we achieved over the past year and execute on our strategic initiatives focused on gathering and retaining client assets.\n\nOur operating expenses decreased by $4.7 million, or 3%, to $133.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $137.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWe believe cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient over the next twelve months to meet our working capital requirements. Further, we expect that cash on hand, including short-term investments and cash generated by operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.\n\nAs part of our review of sub-scale product offerings, during 2019, we sold our wholly-owned subsidiary Perspective Partners, LLC ( PPI\u201d), an employee benefits software and service provider to plan sponsors, administrators, and participants to Manning Partners, LLC, an entity owned by William Manning, the Chairman of our Board of Directors. We received $3.1 million of cash proceeds and recorded a $2.9 million gain on the sale.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures:\nGlobal equity performance was strong in 2019, with the major gains driven by an easing of several key risks that had been acting as an overhang on markets. Growth in U.S. equities was particularly strong, although international markets experienced solid gains as well. Within the U.S., small-cap stocks slightly outperformed large-cap stocks, and stylistically, growth again outperformed value, continuing a multi-year trend.\n________________________\nThe Company is nearing the completion of the 2020 exchange period whereby eligible Class A units of Manning & Napier Group held by M&N Group Holdings and MNCC may be tendered for exchange. In connection with the exchange, the Company has the ability to pay an amount of cash equal to the number of units exchanged multiplied by the value of one share\nNon-Operating Income (Loss)\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nAssets Under Management\nOur institutional and intermediary channel represented 55% of our total AUM as of December 31, 2019. Blended portfolios are also the largest portion of institutional and intermediary assets at 59% of AUM, followed by equity and fixed income portfolios at 34% and 7%, respectively.\n \u2022 fixed costs, including changes to base compensation, vendor-related costs and investment spending on new products.  Assets Under Management and Investment Performance\n (3) The amount of net gain (loss) on investments held by us, to provide initial cash seeding for product development purposes and to hedge economic exposure to market movements on our deferred compensation plan, will vary depending on the performance and overall amount of our investments. \nManagement judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance that might be required against deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2019, we have not recorded a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. In the event that sufficient taxable income does not result in future years, among other things, a valuation allowance for certain of our deferred tax assets may be required. Because\nManning & Napier, Inc. holds an economic interest of approximately 19.2% in Manning & Napier Group as of December 31, 2019, but as managing member controls all of the business and affairs of Manning & Napier Group. As a result, the Company consolidates the financial results of Manning & Napier Group and records a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of operations represents the portion of earnings attributable to the economic interest in Manning & Napier Group held by the noncontrolling interests.\nGoodwill\nCompensation and related costs decreased by $6.4 million, or 7%, to $81.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $87.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was driven by a 16% reduction in our average workforce and lower variable incentive costs as a result of the reduction in AUM and revenue. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $2.4 million in 2019 from 2018 attributable to the timing and amount of awards granted under our equity and long-term incentive plans. Employee severance costs decreased by $0.7 million to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As a percentage of revenue, compensation and related costs for 2019 were 60%, compared to 54% in 2018.\n (1) Transfers of client assets between portfolios are included in gross client inflows and gross client outflows. \nFinancing Activities\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recent accounting pronouncements,\" included in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, blended asset portfolios represented 51% of the separate account gross client inflows from the wealth management sales channel, while equity and fixed income portfolios represented 45% and 4%, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, blended asset and equity portfolios represented 81% and 15%, respectively, of total wealth management separate account AUM, while our fixed income portfolios were 4%. We expect our focus on individuals, endowments, foundations, and retirement plans to continue to drive interest in our separately managed account investment strategies.\nMutual fund and collective investment trust revenue decreased by $12.1 million, or 29%, to $29.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $41.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was driven primarily by a 15%, or $1.1 billion, decrease in our average mutual fund and collective investment trust AUM for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, coupled with the effects of the mutual fund fee restructure completed in the first quarter of 2019. On an annualized basis, our average fee on mutual fund and collective investment trust products decreased to 0.64% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 0.73% for the full year 2018. This decrease was due primarily to the restructuring of our funds during 2019. For both periods, management fees earned on our mutual fund and collective investment trust management fees ranged from 0.14% to 0.90%, depending on investment strategy. As of December 31, 2019, the concentration of investments in our mutual fund and collective investment trusts was 68% blended assets, 30% equity and 2% fixed income, compared to 70% blended assets, 28% equity and 2% fixed income as of December 31, 2018.\n\nThe following tables reflect the indicated components of our AUM for our investment vehicles for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nWe serve as the investment adviser for the Fund, Exeter Trust Company Collective Investment Trusts ( CIT\u201d) and Rainier Multiple Investment Trust, which are legal entities, the business and affairs of which are managed by their respective boards of directors. As a result, each of these entities is a VOE. We hold, in limited cases, direct investments in a fund (which are made on the same terms as are available to other investors) and consolidate each of these entities where it has a controlling financial interest or a majority voting interest.\n \u2022 Level 1-observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical securities; \nThe annual test of goodwill indicated that there were no facts or circumstances occurring in 2019 suggesting possible impairment. The impairment tests included certain underlying key assumptions regarding future overall market trends and our operating performance.

Napier, Inc. and its interest in Manning & Napier Group as of December 31, 2019. Manning & Napier, Inc. holds a 19.2% economic interest in Manning & Napier Group but controls all its business and affairs. The financial results of Manning & Napier Group are consolidated in Manning & Napier, Inc.'s financial statements, with a noncontrolling interest recorded for the remaining economic interest held by others.\n\nThe report shows a decrease in net cash used in financing activities, primarily resulting from reduced distributions to noncontrolling interests and dividends due to lower net income. There is also an increase in cash used for purchasing Class A units of Manning & Napier Group compared to the previous year.\n\nAssets under management (AUM) are categorized by investment vehicle and portfolio. As of December 31, 2019, total AUM is approximately $19.5 billion, spread across separately managed accounts, mutual funds, and collective investment trusts in blended, equity, and fixed income portfolios. The total has decreased slightly since December 31, 2018, due to net client outflows, partially offset by market appreciation.\n\nThe company earns most of its revenues from investment management fees for advisory services to these accounts. Revenues have seen some decrease primarily due to declines in average AUM and restructuring of mutual fund fees.\n\nThe report includes detailed financial data tables, covering various aspects of the company's economic standing, including assets, liabilities, revenues, operating activities, and net income. The company has also completed strategic restructuring, including the sale of a business and engaged in a new partnership to upgrade its technology platform. The changes incurred costs but are expected to improve future financial results.\n\nManning & Napier, Inc. uses non-GAAP measures such as economic income, economic net income, and economic net income per adjusted share to evaluate business performance and provide insights beyond GAAP measures. The report emphasizes that these non-GAAP measures should be considered alongside, not as a replacement for, GAAP measures. \n\nLastly, the report acknowledges that as an investment management firm, Manning & Napier's performance and results are significantly influenced by global financial market returns and the relative performance of its investment strategies."}
