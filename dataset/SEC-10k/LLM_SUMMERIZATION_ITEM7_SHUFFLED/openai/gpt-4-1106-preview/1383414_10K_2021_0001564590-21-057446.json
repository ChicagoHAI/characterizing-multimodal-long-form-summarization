You should not place undue influence on the forward-looking statements as our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements for any reason, including the factors in Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Report.\nAlthough we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and, as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. Important assumptions include our ability to originate new loans and investments, certain margins and levels of profitability and the availability of additional capital. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward- looking statement in this Report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved.\nWe have based the forward-looking statements included in this Report on information available to us on the date of this Report, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Although we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements in this Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, you are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we in the future may file with the SEC, including reports on Form 10-Q/K and current reports on Form 8-K.\nYou should understand that under Section 27A(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Act and Section 21E(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, the safe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 do not apply to forward-looking statements made in periodic reports we file under the Exchange Act.\nThe following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Report.\nOverview\nPennantPark Investment Corporation is a BDC whose objectives are to generate both current income and capital appreciation while seeking to preserve capital through debt and equity investments primarily made to U.S. middle-market companies in the form of first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and equity investments.\nWe believe middle-market companies offer attractive risk-reward to investors due to a limited amount of capital available for such companies. We seek to create a diversified portfolio that includes first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and equity investments by investing approximately $10 million to $50 million of capital, on average, in the securities of middle-market companies. We expect this investment size to vary proportionately with the size of our capital base. We use the term middle-market\u201d to refer to companies with annual revenues between $50 million and $1 billion. The companies in which we invest are typically highly leveraged, and, in most cases, are not rated by national rating agencies. If such companies were rated, we believe that they would typically receive a rating below investment grade (between BB and CCC under the Standard & Poor's system) from the national rating agencies. Securities rated below investment grade are often referred to as leveraged loans\u201d or high yield\u201d securities or junk bonds\u201d and are often higher risk compared to debt instruments that are rated above investment grade and have speculative characteristics. Our debt investments may generally range in maturity from three to ten years and are made to U.S. and, to a limited extent, non-U.S. corporations, partnerships and other business entities which operate in various industries and geographical regions.\nOur investment activity depends on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. We have used, and expect to continue to use, our debt capital, proceeds from the rotation of our portfolio and proceeds from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives.\nOrganization and Structure of PennantPark Investment Corporation\nPennantPark Investment Corporation, a Maryland corporation organized in January 2007, is a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified investment company that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for federal income tax purposes we have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code.\nSBIC II, our wholly-owned subsidiary, was organized as a Delaware limited partnership in 2012. SBIC II received a license from the SBA to operate as a SBIC under Section 301(c) of the 1958 Act. SBIC II's objectives are to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments generally by investing with us in SBA eligible businesses that meet the investment selection criteria used by PennantPark Investment.\nOur investment activities are managed by the Investment Adviser. Under our Investment Management Agreement, we have agreed to pay our Investment Adviser an annual base management fee based on our average adjusted gross assets as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. PennantPark Investment, through the Investment Adviser, provides similar services to SBIC II under its investment management agreement. SBIC II's investment management agreement does not affect the management and incentive fees on a consolidated basis. We have also entered into an Administration Agreement with the Administrator. Under our Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under our Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs. PennantPark Investment, through the Administrator, provides similar services to SBIC II under its administration agreement with us. Our board of directors, a majority of whom are independent of us, provides overall supervision of our activities, and the Investment Adviser supervises our day-to-day activities.\nCOVID-19 Developments\nCOVID-19 was first detected in December 2019 and has since been identified as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. The effect of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or any worsening thereof, uncertainty relating to more contagious strains of the virus, the length of recovery of certain economic sectors in the U.S. and globally and the speed and efficiency of the vaccination process, including the extent to which the available vaccines are ineffective against any new COVID- 19 variants may create stress on the market and may affect some of our portfolio companies. We cannot predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including any worsening thereof or its duration in the United States and globally and any impact to our business operations or the business operations of our portfolio companies. Depending on the length and magnitude of the disruption to the operations of our portfolio companies, certain portfolio companies may experience financial distress and possibly default on their financial obligations to us and their other capital providers in the future. These developments could impact the value of our investments in such portfolio companies.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, including any worsening thereof, may have an adverse impact on certain sectors of the global economy. Particularly, COVID-19 presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to our future performance and financial results as well as the future performance and financial results of our portfolio companies due to the risk of any sever adverse reaction to the vaccine, politicization of the vaccination process or general public skepticism of the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. While we are unable to predict the ultimate adverse effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, or any worsening thereof, on our results of operation, we have identified certain factors that are likely to affect market, economic and geopolitical conditions, and thereby may adversely affect our business, including:\nTable 205: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> U.S. and global economic recovery;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> changes in interest rates, including LIBOR;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 207: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> limited availability of credit, both in the United States and internationally;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> disruptions to supply-chains and price volatility;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 209: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> changes to existing laws and regulations, or the imposition of new laws and regulations; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> uncertainty regarding future governmental and regulatory policies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe business disruption and financial harm resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic experienced by some of our portfolio companies may reduce, over time, the amount of interest and dividend income that we receive from such investments and may require us to provide an increase of capital to such companies in the form of follow on investments. In connection with the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may also need to restructure the capitalization of some of our portfolio companies, which could result in reduced interest payments, an increase in the amount of PIK interest we receive or a permanent reduction in the value of our investments. If our net investment income decreases, the percentage of our cash flows dedicated to debt servicing and distribution payments to stockholders would subsequently increase. This has required us to reduce the amount of our distributions to stockholders as compared to distributions in previous years. Although we had no non-accrual assets during the quarter ended September 30, 2021, the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or any worsening thereof, may result in portfolio investments being placed on non-accrual status in the future.\nAdditionally, as of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, our asset coverage ratio, as computed in accordance with the 1940 Act, was 221% and 208%, respectively. The Truist Credit Facility includes standard covenants and events of default provisions. If we fail to make the required payments or breach the covenants therein, it could result in a default under the Truist Credit Facility. Failure to cure such default or obtain a waiver from the appropriate party would result in an event of default, and the lenders may accelerate the repayment of our indebtedness under the Truist Credit Facility, such that all amounts owed are due immediately at the time of default. Such an action would negatively affect our liquidity, business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.\nWe are also subject to financial risks, including changes in market interest rates. As of September 30, 2021, our debt portfolio consisted of 92% variable-rate investments. The variable-rate loans are usually based on a floating interest rate index such as LIBOR and typically have durations of three months after which they reset to current market interest rates. Variable-rate investments subject to a floor generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to nine months only if the index exceeds the floor. In addition, the Truist Credit Facility also has floating rate interest provisions, with pricing set at 225 basis points over LIBOR (or an alternative risk-free floating interest rate index). In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks have reduced interest rates, which has caused LIBOR to decrease. Due to such rates, our gross investment income may decrease, which could result in a decrease in our net investment income if such decreases in LIBOR are not offset by, among other things, a corresponding increase in the spread over LIBOR that we earn on such loans or a decrease in the interest rate of our floating interest rate liabilities tied to LIBOR. See Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d below.\nIn addition, we have continued to implement our business continuity planning strategy. Our priority has been to safeguard the health of our employees and to ensure continuity of business operations on behalf of our investors. As a result of our business continuity planning strategy, nearly all of our employees have returned to the office. Our systems and infrastructure have continued to support our business operations. We implemented a heightened level of communication across senior management, our investment team and our board of directors, and we have proactively engaged with our vendors on a regular basis to ensure they continue to meet our criteria for business continuity.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenue in the form of interest income on the debt securities we hold and capital gains and dividends, if any, on investment securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Our debt investments, whether in the form of first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt or subordinated debt, typically have a term of three to ten years and bear interest at a fixed or a floating rate. Interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semiannually. In some cases, our investments provide for deferred interest payments and PIK interest. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest generally becomes due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of amendment, commitment, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing significant managerial assistance and possibly consulting fees. Loan origination fees, OID and market discount or premium and deferred financing costs on liabilities, which we do not fair value, are capitalized and accreted or amortized using the effective interest method as interest income or, in the case of deferred financing costs, as interest expense. Dividend income, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis on the ex-dividend date to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. From time to time, the Company receives certain fees from portfolio companies, which are non-recurring in nature. Such fees include loan prepayment penalties, structuring fees and amendment fees, and are recorded as other investment income when earned.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of a management fee and the payment of an incentive fee to our Investment Adviser, if any, our allocable portion of overhead under our Administration Agreement and other operating costs as detailed below. Our management fee compensates our Investment Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, consummating and monitoring our investments. Additionally, we pay interest expense on the outstanding debt and unused commitment fees on undrawn amounts, under our various debt facilities. We bear all other direct or indirect costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including:\nTable 211: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td> the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td> the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td> fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments, including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence and reviews of prospective investments or complementary businesses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td> expenses incurred by the Investment Adviser in performing due diligence and reviews of investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 215: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td> transfer agent and custodial fees;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td> fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td> federal and state registration fees and any exchange listing fees;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td> federal, state, local and foreign taxes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td> independent directors' fees and expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td> brokerage commissions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td> fidelity bond, directors and officers, errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 222: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td> direct costs such as printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td> fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td> costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act, the 1958 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td> all other expenses incurred by either the Administrator or us in connection with administering our business, including payments under our Administration Agreement that will be based upon our allocable portion of overhead, and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under our Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGenerally, during periods of asset growth, we expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or to decline as a percentage of total assets and increase during periods of asset declines. Incentive fees, interest expense and costs relating to future offerings of securities would be additive to the expenses described above.\nPORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY\nAs of September 30, 2021, our portfolio totaled $1,255.3 million and consisted of $552.5 million of first lien secured debt, $176.9 million of second lien secured debt, $121.2 million of subordinated debt (including $64.2 million in PSLF) and $404.7 million of preferred and common equity (including $41.2 million in PSLF).

Our overall portfolio consisted of 80 companies with an average investment size of $13.5 million, had a weighted average yield on interest bearing debt investments of 8.9% and was invested 41% in first lien secured debt, 20% in second lien secured debt, 10% in subordinated debt (including 6% in PSLF) and 29% in preferred and common equity (including 3% in PSLF). As of September 30, 2020, all of the investments held by PSLF were first lien secured debt.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2021, we invested $441.4 million of investments in 30 new and 49 existing portfolio companies with a weighted average yield on debt investments of 8.1%. Sales and repayments of investments for the same period totaled $434.5 million.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2020, we invested $319.3 million of investments in 25 new and 58 existing portfolio companies with a weighted average yield on debt investments of 8.4%.

PSLF's sales and repayments of investments for the same period totaled $11.1 million.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of our assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported periods. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary for the fair presentation of financial statements have been included. Actual results could differ from these estimates due to changes in the economic and regulatory environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates and assumptions, including the credit worthiness of our portfolio companies and the global outbreak of COVID-19. We may reclassify certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. We have eliminated all intercompany balances and transactions. References to ASC serve as a single source of accounting literature. Subsequent events are evaluated and disclosed as appropriate for events occurring through the date the Consolidated Financial Statements are issued. In addition to the discussion below, we describe our critical accounting policies in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInvestment Valuations\nWe expect that there may not be readily available market values for many of the investments which are or will be in our portfolio, and we value such investments at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process, as described in this Report. With respect to investments for which there is no readily available market value, the factors that our board of directors may take into account in pricing our investments at fair value include, as relevant, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate or revise our valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the price used in an actual transaction may be different than our valuation and the difference may be material.\nOur portfolio generally consists of illiquid securities, including debt and equity investments. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or for which market quotations are deemed not reflective of the fair value, our board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of our Investment Adviser responsible for the portfolio investment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the management of the Investment Adviser;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 228: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (3)\n</td> <td> Our board of directors also engages independent valuation firms to conduct independent appraisals of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment. The independent valuation firms review management's preliminary valuations in light of their own independent assessment and also in light of any market quotations obtained from an independent pricing service, broker, dealer or market maker;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 229: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (4)\n</td> <td> The audit committee of our board of directors reviews the preliminary valuations of the Investment Adviser and those of the independent valuation firms on a quarterly basis, periodically assesses the valuation methodologies of the independent valuation firms, and responds to and supplements the valuation recommendations of the independent valuation firms to reflect any comments; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 230: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (5)\n</td> <td> Our board of directors discusses these valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith, based on the input of our Investment Adviser, the respective independent valuation firms and the audit committee.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur board of directors generally uses market quotations to assess the value of our investments for which market quotations are readily available. We obtain these market values from independent pricing services or at the bid prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers, if available, or otherwise from a principal market maker or a primary market dealer. The Investment Adviser assesses the source and reliability of bids from brokers or dealers. If our board of directors has a bona fide reason to believe any such market quote does not reflect the fair value of an investment, it may independently value such investments by using the valuation procedure that it uses with respect to assets for which market quotations are not readily available.\nFair value, as defined under ASC 820, is the price that we would receive upon selling an investment or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction to a market participant in the principal or most advantageous market for the investment or liability. ASC 820 emphasizes that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of us. Unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available to us on the reporting period date.\nASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchies:\nTable 231: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Level 1:\n</td> <td> Inputs that are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by us at the measurement date.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Level 2:\n</td> <td> Inputs that are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or that are quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term, if applicable, of the financial instrument.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Level 3:\n</td> <td> Inputs that are unobservable for an asset or liability because they are based on our own assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Generally, most of our investments, our Credit Facilities, 2026 Notes and our SBA debentures are classified as Level 3. Our 2019 Notes were, and our 2024 Notes are, classified as Level 2 as they were valued using the closing price from the primary exchange. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the price used in an actual transaction may be different than our valuation and those differences may be material.\nThe SEC recently adopted Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act which established requirements for determining fair value in good faith purposes of the 1940 Act. We will comply with the requirement of the rule before the requirement date in 2022.\nIn addition to using the above inputs to value cash equivalents, investments, our 2019 Notes, our SBA debentures, our 2024 Notes, our 2026 Notes and our Credit Facilities valuations, we employ the valuation policy approved by our board of directors that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with our valuation policy, we evaluate the source of inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading, in determining fair value.\nGenerally, the carrying value of our consolidated financial liabilities approximates fair value. We have adopted the principles under ASC Subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments, or ASC 825-10, which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value, and made an irrevocable election to apply ASC 825-10 to our Credit Facilities and, prior to their redemption, the 2019 Notes. We elected to use the fair value option for the Credit Facilities and, prior to their redemption, the 2019 Notes to align the measurement attributes of both our assets and liabilities while mitigating volatility in earnings from using different measurement attributes. Due to that election and in accordance with GAAP, we incurred expenses of zero, zero and $7.1 million relating to amendment costs on the Credit Facilities during the years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. ASC 825-10 establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities and to more easily understand the effect on earnings of a company's choice to use fair value. ASC 825-10 also requires entities to display the fair value of the selected assets and liabilities on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and changes in fair value of the Credit Facilities and, prior to their redemption, the 2019 Notes are reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We elect not to apply ASC 825-10 to any other financial assets or liabilities, including the 2024 Notes, 2026 Notes and SBA debentures.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2021, the Credit Facility had a net change in unrealized appreciation of $17.8 million. For the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Credit Facilities and the 2019 Notes had a net change in unrealized depreciation of $12.3 million and $5.7 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2021, the net unrealized depreciation on our Credit Facility totaled $1.7 million. As of September 30, 2020, the net unrealized depreciation on our Credit Facilities totaled $19.6 million. We use a nationally recognized independent valuation service to measure the fair value of our Credit Facilities and, prior to their redemption, the 2019 Notes in a manner consistent with the valuation process that the board of directors uses to value our investments.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt investments with contractual PIK interest, which represents interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we will generally not accrue PIK interest when the portfolio company valuation indicates that such PIK interest is not collectable. We do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt investments if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Loan origination fees, OID, market discount or premium and deferred financing costs on liabilities, which we do not fair value, are capitalized and then accreted or amortized using the effective interest method as interest income or, in the case of deferred financing costs, as interest expense. We record prepayment penalties on loans and debt investments as income. Dividend income, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis on the ex-dividend date to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. From time to time, the Company receives certain fees from portfolio companies, which are non-recurring in nature. Such fees include loan prepayment penalties, structuring fees and amendment fees, and are recorded as other investment income when earned.\nNet Realized Gains or Losses and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation\nWe measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, using the specific identification method, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering unamortized upfront fees and prepayment penalties. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in the fair values of our portfolio investments, and our Credit Facilities, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized.\nForeign Currency Translation\nOur books and records are maintained in U.S. dollars. Any foreign currency amounts are translated into U.S. dollars on the following basis:\nTable 234: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.\n</td> <td> Fair value of investment securities, other assets and liabilities - at the exchange rates prevailing at the end of the applicable period; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 235: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.\n</td> <td> Purchases and sales of investment securities, income and expenses - at the exchange rates prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlthough net assets and fair values are presented based on the applicable foreign exchange rates described above, we do not isolate that portion of the results of operations due to changes in foreign exchange rates on investments, other assets and debt from the fluctuations arising from changes in fair values of investments and liabilities held. Such fluctuations are included with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments and liabilities.\nPayment-in-Kind, or, PIK Interest\nWe have investments in our portfolio which contain a PIK interest provision. PIK interest is added to the principal balance of the investment and is recorded as income. In order for us to maintain our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC, substantially all of this income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes, even though we may not have collected any cash with respect to interest on PIK securities.\nFederal Income Taxes\nWe have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually to maintain our election to be treated, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our RIC tax election, we must, among other requirements, meet certain annual source-of-income and quarterly asset diversification requirements. We also must annually distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders out of the assets legally available for distribution of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of the sum of our net ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, or investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid.\nAlthough not required for us to maintain our RIC tax status, in order to preclude the imposition of a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax imposed on RICs, we must distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders in respect of each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income (subject to certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of the excess, if any, of our capital gains over our capital losses, or capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year plus (3) the sum of any net ordinary income plus capital gain net income for preceding years that was not distributed during such years and on which we did not incur any U.S. federal income tax, or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. In addition, although we may distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions in the manner described above, we have retained and may continue to retain such net capital gains or investment company taxable income, contingent on maintaining our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC, in order to provide us with additional liquidity.\nBecause federal income tax regulations differ from GAAP, distributions characterized in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and net realized gain recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences between tax regulations and GAAP may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified among capital accounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements to reflect their appropriate tax character. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future.\nWe have formed and expect to continue to form certain taxable subsidiaries, including the Taxable Subsidiaries, which are subject to tax as corporations. These taxable subsidiaries allow us to hold equity securities of certain portfolio companies treated as pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes while facilitating our ability to qualify as a RIC under the Code.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSet forth below are the results of operations for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. For information regarding results of operations for the year ended September 30, 2019, see the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, as filed with the SEC on November 19, 2020.\nInvestment Income\nInvestment income for the year ended September 30, 2021 was $81.6 million and was attributable to $47.0 million from first lien secured debt, $20.2 million from second lien secured debt and $7.0 million from subordinated debt and $7.4 from preferred and common equity. The decrease in investment income over the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in LIBOR and a lower average investment balance.\nInvestment income for the year ended September 30, 2020 was $100.2 million and was attributable to $63.4 million from first lien secured debt, $25.9 million from second lien secured debt and $8.7 million from subordinated debt and $2.2 from preferred and common equity.\nExpenses\nNet expenses for the year ended September 30, 2021 totaled $45.1 million. Base management fee for the same period totaled $17.3 million, incentive fee totaled $0.6 million, debt related interest and other financing expenses totaled $22.5 million and general and administrative expenses totaled $4.1 million. The decrease in expenses over the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in debt related expenses and a decrease in incentive fees.as well as the incentive fee waiver.\nNet expenses for the year ended September 30, 2020 totaled $61.5 million. Base management fee for the same period totaled $18.6 million, incentive fee totaled $2.7 million (after a waiver of $1.9 million), debt related interest and other financing expenses totaled $34.4 million (including one-time costs of $2.2 million associated with the PSLF transaction) and general and administrative expenses totaled $4.7 million.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income totaled $36.5 million, or $0.54 per share, and $38.7 million, or $0.58 per share, for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in net investment income per share compared to the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in LIBOR.\nNet Realized Gains or Losses\nSales and repayments of investments for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 totaled $434.5 million and $162.7 million, respectively, and net realized gain (loss) totaled $30.0 million and ($20.8) million, respectively. The change in realized gains/losses was primarily due to changes in the market conditions of our investments and the values at which they were realized, caused by the fluctuations in the market and in the economy, as discussed above under COVID-19 Developments\u201d.\nUnrealized Appreciation or Depreciation on Investments and Credit Facilities\nFor the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, we reported net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments of $117.9 million and ($46.2) million, respectively. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, our net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments totaled $34.2 million and ($83.8) million, respectively. The net change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on our investments for the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to the prior year was primarily due to changes in the capital market conditions of our investments and the values at which they were realized, caused by the fluctuation in the market and in the economy, as discussed above under COVID-19 Developments.\u201d\nFor the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, our Credit Facilities had a net change in unrealized (appreciation) depreciation of $(17.8) million and $12.3 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, our net unrealized depreciation on our Credit Facilities totaled $1.7 million and $19.6 million, respectively. The net change in unrealized depreciation for the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to the prior year was primarily due to changes in the capital markets, as further discussed above under COVID-19 Developments\u201d.\nNet Change in Net Assets Resulting From Operations\nNet change in net assets resulting from operations totaled $166.6 million, or $2.49 per share, and ($16.0) million, or ($0.24) per share, for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in net assets from operations for the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to the prior year was primarily due to appreciation of the portfolio primarily driven by recovery from the market disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainty surrounding its continued adverse economic impact, as discussed above under COVID-19 Developments.\u201d\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur liquidity and capital resources are derived primarily from proceeds of securities offerings, debt capital and cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments, and income earned. Our primary use of funds from operations includes investments in portfolio companies and payments of fees and other operating expenses we incur. We have used, and expect to continue to use, our debt capital, proceeds from the rotation of our portfolio and proceeds from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives. As of September 30, 2021, in accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to borrow amounts such that we are in compliance with a 150% asset coverage ratio requirement after such borrowing, excluding SBA debentures pursuant to exemptive relief from the SEC received in June 2011. This Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section should be read in conjunction with the COVID-19 Developments\u201d section above.\nOn February 5, 2019, our stockholders approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 (which includes the SBCAA) as approved by our board of directors on November 13, 2018. As a result, the asset coverage requirement applicable to us for senior securities was reduced from 200% (i.e., $1 of debt outstanding for each $1 of equity) to 150% (i.e., $2 of debt outstanding for each $1 of equity), subject to compliance with certain disclosure requirements.\nAs of September 30, 2021 and 2020, our asset coverage ratio, as computed in accordance with the 1940 Act, was 221% and 208%, respectively.\nThe annualized weighted average cost of debt for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, inclusive of the fee on the undrawn commitment and amendment costs on the Credit Facilities, amortized upfront fees on SBA debentures and debt retirement and issuance costs, was 3.5% and 4.0%, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2021, we had the multi-currency Truist Credit Facility for up to $435.0 million (decreased from $475.0 million on May 25, 2021 pursuant to its terms) in borrowings with certain lenders and Truist Bank (formerly SunTrust Bank), acting as administrative agent, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., acting as syndication agent for the lenders. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, we had $316.5 million and $388.3 million, respectively, in outstanding borrowings under the Truist Credit Facility. The Truist Credit Facility had a weighted average interest rate of 2.4% and 2.5%, respectively, exclusive of the fee on undrawn commitments, as of September 30, 2021 and 2020. The Truist Credit Facility is a revolving facility with a stated maturity date of September 4, 2024, a one-year term-out period on September 4, 2023 and pricing set at 225 basis points over LIBOR (or an alternative risk-free floating interest rate index). As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, we had $118.5 million and $86.7 million of unused borrowing capacity under the Truist Credit Facility, respectively, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions. The Truist Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets excluding assets held by SBIC II. As of September 30, 2021, we were in compliance with the terms of the Truist Credit Facility.\nAs of September 30, 2021, we had $86.3 million in aggregate principal amount of 2024 Notes outstanding. Interest on the 2024 Notes is paid quarterly on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15, at a rate of 5.5% per year, commencing January 15, 2020. The 2024 Notes mature on October 15, 2024. The 2024 Notes are direct unsecured obligations and rank pari passu in right of payment with our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness. The 2024 Notes are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our subsidiaries, financing vehicles, or similar facilities. The 2024 Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option on or after October 15, 2021 at a redemption price of 100% of the outstanding principal amount of the 2024 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nIn April 2021, we issued $150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes at a public offering price per note of 99.4%. Interest on the 2026 Notes is paid semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, at a rate of 4.50% per year, commencing November 1, 2021. The 2026 Notes mature on May 1, 2026 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option subject to a make-whole premium if redeemed more than three months prior to maturity. The 2026 Notes are general, unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The 2026 Notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our subsidiaries, financing vehicles, or similar facilities. We do not intend to list the 2026 Notes on any securities exchange or automated dealer quotation system.\nIn September 2014, we issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes, for net proceeds of $245.5 million after underwriting discounts and offering costs. Interest on the 2019 Notes was paid semi-annually on April 1 and October 1, at a rate of 4.5% per year. On March 4, 2019 the 2019 Notes were redeemed in full and no amounts were outstanding as of September 30, 2021. The 2019 Notes were redeemed on March 4, 2019 at a redemption price equal to $1,008.65 for each $1,000.00 of principal of notes outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest to March 4, 2019, pursuant to the indenture governing the 2019 Notes. Please refer to our indenture agreement filed as Exhibit (d)(8) to our post-effective amendment filed on January 22, 2013 and the supplemental indenture agreement filed as Exhibit (d)(11) to our post-effective amendment filed on September 23, 2014 for more information.\nWe may raise additional equity or debt capital through both registered offerings off our shelf registration statement and private offerings of securities, by securitizing a portion of our investments or borrowing from the SBA, among other sources. Any future additional debt capital we incur, to the extent it is available, may be issued at a higher cost and on less favorable terms and conditions than our current Credit Facility or SBA debentures. Furthermore, our Credit Facility availability depends on various covenants and restrictions. The primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for repayment of indebtedness, investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our stockholders or for other general corporate or strategic purposes such as our stock repurchase program.\nWe have entered into certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. Under our Investment Management Agreement, which was reapproved by our board of directors (including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us or the Investment Adviser) in February 2021 PennantPark Investment Advisers serves as our investment adviser. PennantPark Investment, through the Investment Adviser, provides similar services to SBIC II under its investment management agreement with us. SBIC II's investment management agreement does not affect the management or incentive fees that we pay to the Investment Adviser on a consolidated basis. Payments under our Investment Management Agreement in each reporting period are equal to (1) a management fee equal to a percentage of the value of our average adjusted gross assets and (2) an incentive fee based on our performance.\nUnder our Administration Agreement, which was most recently reapproved by our board of directors, including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us, in February 2021 the Administrator furnishes us with office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. PennantPark Investment, through the Administrator, provides similar services to SBIC II under its administration agreements, which are intended to have no effect on the consolidated administration fee. If requested to provide significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies, we or the Administrator will be paid an additional amount based on the services provided. Payment under our Administration Agreement is based upon our allocable portion of the Administrator's overhead in performing its obligations under our Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs.\nIf any of our contractual obligations discussed above are terminated, our costs under new agreements that we enter into may increase. In addition, we will likely incur significant time and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under our Investment Management Agreement and our Administration Agreement. Any new investment management agreement would also be subject to approval by our stockholders.\nOn May 9, 2018, we announced a share repurchase program which allowed us to repurchase up to $30 million of our outstanding common stock in the open market at prices below our NAV as reported in our then most recently published consolidated financial statements. The program expired on May 9, 2019. During the year ended September 30, 2019, we repurchased 2.0 million shares of common stock, respectively, in open market transactions for an aggregate cost (including transaction costs) of $14.5 million. From May 9, 2018 through the program's expiration, we purchased 4.0 million shares of common stock in open market transactions for an aggregate cost (including transaction costs) of $29.5 million.\nSBIC II is able to borrow funds from the SBA against regulatory capital (which approximates equity capital) that is paid-in and is subject to customary regulatory requirements including an examination by the SBA. We have funded SBIC II with $75.0 million of equity capital and it had SBA debentures outstanding of $63.5 million as of September 30, 2021. SBA debentures are non-recourse to us and may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA debentures is fixed at the time of issuance, often referred to as pooling, at a market-driven spread over 10-year U.S. Treasury Notes. Under current SBA regulations, a SBIC may individually borrow to a maximum of $175.0 million, which is up to twice its potential regulatory capital, and as part of a group of SBICs under common control may borrow a maximum of $350.0 million in the aggregate.\nAs of both September 30, 2021 and 2020, SBIC II had an initial $150.0 million in debt commitments, all of which were drawn. During the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, $55.0 million and $31.5 million in SBA debentures were repaid, respectively. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the unamortized fees on the SBA debentures were $1.3 million and $2.7 million, respectively. The SBA debentures' upfront fees of 3.4% consist of a commitment fee of 1.0% and an issuance discount of 2.4%, which are being amortized.\nOur fixed-rate SBA debentures were as follows:\nTable 236: <table> <tr> <td> Issuance Dates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Maturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fixed All-in Coupon Rate (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of September 30, 2021\nPrincipal Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September 20, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 1, 2027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> March 21, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 1, 2028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted Average Rate / Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63,500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Issuance Dates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Maturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fixed All-in Coupon Rate (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of September 30, 2020\nPrincipal Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> March 23, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 1, 2026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September 21, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 1, 2026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September 20, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 1, 2027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> March 21, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 1, 2028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58,500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted Average Rate / Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 118,500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Excluding 3.4% of upfront fees.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe SBIC program is designed to stimulate the flow of capital into eligible businesses. Under SBA regulations, SBIC II is subject to regulatory requirements, including making investments in SBA eligible businesses, investing at least 25% of regulatory capital in eligible smaller businesses, as defined under the 1958 Act, placing certain limitations on the financing terms of investments, prohibiting investment in certain industries and requiring capitalization thresholds that limit distributions to us, and are subject to periodic audits and examinations of their financial statements that are prepared on a basis of accounting other than GAAP (for example, fair value, as defined under ASC 820, is not required to be used for assets or liabilities for such compliance reporting). As of September 30, 2021, SBIC II was in compliance with their regulatory requirements.\nIn accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, PennantPark Investment is only allowed to borrow amounts such that our required 150% asset coverage ratio is met after such borrowing. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, we excluded the principal amounts of our SBA debentures from our asset coverage ratio pursuant to SEC exemptive relief. In 2011, we received exemptive relief from the SEC allowing us to modify the asset coverage ratio requirement to exclude the SBA debentures from the calculation. Accordingly, our ratio of total assets on a consolidated basis to outstanding indebtedness may be less than 150% which, while providing increased investment flexibility, also increases our exposure to risks associated with leverage.\nAs of September 30, 2021 and 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $20.4 million and $25.8 million, respectively, available for investing and general corporate purposes. We believe our liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to take advantage of market opportunities.\nOur operating activities provided cash of $7.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, and our financing activities used cash of $(13.4) million for the same period. Our operating activities used cash primarily for our investment activities and our financing activities provided cash primarily for net repayments under our Credit Facilities and the repayment of the SBA debentures.\nOur operating activities used cash of $129.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2020, and our financing activities provided cash of $95.8 million for the same period. Our operating activities used cash primarily for our investment activities and our financing activities provided cash primarily for net borrowings under our Credit Facilities.\nFor more information regarding our borrowing arrangements, see Business-Leverage\u201d above.\nSenior Securities\nInformation about our senior securities is shown in the following table as of September 30, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012.

PSLF invests primarily in middle-market and other corporate debt securities consistent with our strategy. PSLF was formed as a Delaware limited liability company. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020 PSLF had total assets of $417.4 million and $361.8 million, respectively. PSLF's portfolio consisted of debt investments in 47 and 37 portfolio companies as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of September 30, 2021, at fair value, the largest investment in a single portfolio company in PSLF was $16.8 million and the five largest investments totaled $74.4 million. As of September 30, 2020, at fair value, the largest investment in a single portfolio company in PSLF was $18.4 million and the five largest investments totaled $77.9 million. PSLF invests in portfolio companies in the same industries in which we may directly invest.\nWe provide capital to PSLF in the form of subordinated notes and equity interests. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020 we and Pantheon owned 60.5% and 39.5%, and 72.0% and 28.0%, respectively, of each of the outstanding subordinated notes and equity interests of PSLF.

All material decisions with respect to PSLF, including those involving its investment portfolio, require unanimous approval of a quorum of the Member Designees' Committee. Quorum is defined as (i) the presence of two members of the Member Designees' Committee; provided that at least one individual is present that was elected, designated or appointed by each of us and Pantheon; (ii) the presence of three members of Member Designees' Committee, provided that the individual that was elected, designated or appointed us or Pantheon, as the case may be, with only one individual present shall be entitled to cast two votes on each matter; and (iii) the presence of four members of the Member Designees' Committee shall constitute a quorum, provided that two individuals are present that were elected, designated or appointed by each of us and Pantheon.\nAdditionally, PSLF, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, or PSLF Subsidiary, has entered into a $275.0 million (increased from $250.0 million on November 6, 2020) senior secured revolving credit facility which bears interest at LIBOR (or an alternative risk-free interest rate index) plus 260 basis

September 30, 2021, we entered into an underwriting agreement, or the Underwriting Agreement, dated October 14, 2021, by and among the Company, the Investment Adviser, the Administrator and Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. and Truist Securities, Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named on Schedule A to the Underwriting Agreement, in connection with the issuance and sale of $165.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.0% Notes due 2026, or the 2026-2 Notes. On October 21, 2021, we closed the transaction and issued $165.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2026-2 Notes at a public offering price per note of 99.436%. Interest on the 2026-2 Notes is paid semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, at a rate of 4.0% per year, commencing May 1, 2022. The 2026-2 Notes mature on November 1, 2026 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option subject to a make-whole premium if redeemed more than three months prior to maturity. The 2026-2 Notes are general, unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The 2026-2 Notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our subsidiaries, financing vehicles, or similar facilities. We do not intend to list the 2026-2 Notes on any securities exchange or automated dealer quotation system.\nOn October 14, 2021, we announced that we will redeem $86,250,000 in principal amount of the 2024 Notes in full on November 13, 2021. We redeemed in full the 2024 Notes with a principal amount of $86.3 million on November 13, 2021. The 2024 Notes were redeemed at a redemption price of $25 per 2024 Note, plus accrued and unpaid interest payments otherwise payable for the then-current quarterly interest period accrued to, but excluding, November 13, 2021.\nSubsequent to quarter end, PNNT had new funded investment of $97.8 million, net of sales and repayments.\nDistributions\nIn order to be treated as a RIC for federal income tax purposes and to not be subject to corporate-level tax on undistributed income or gains, we are required, under Subchapter M of the Code, to annually distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders out of the assets legally available for distribution of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of our investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid.\nAlthough not required for us to maintain our RIC tax status, in order to preclude the imposition of a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax imposed on RICs, we must distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders in respect of each calendar year an amount at least equal to the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. In addition, although we may distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions in the manner described above, we have retained and may continue to retain such net capital gains or investment company taxable income, contingent on our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC, in order to provide us with additional liquidity.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, we declared distributions of $0.48 per share and $0.60 per share, respectively, for total distributions of $32.2 million and $40.2 million. We monitor available net investment income to determine if a return of capital for tax purposes may occur for the fiscal year. To the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for any given fiscal year, stockholders will be notified of the portion of those distributions deemed to be a tax return of capital. Tax characteristics of all distributions will be reported to stockholders subject to information reporting on Form 1099-DIV after the end of each calendar year and in our periodic reports filed with the SEC.\nWe intend to continue to make quarterly distributions to our stockholders. Our quarterly distributions, if any, are determined by our board of directors.\nWe maintain an opt out\u201d dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a distribution, then stockholders' cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, unless they specifically opt out\u201d of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash distributions.\nWe may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage ratio for borrowings applicable to us as a BDC under the 1940 Act and/or due to provisions in future credit facilities. If we do not distribute at least a certain percentage of our income annually, we could suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions at a particular level.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.\u201d The guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contract modifications, hedging relationships and other transactions, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of the reference rate reform. ASU 2020-04 is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company is evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company's financial statements.\nTable 253: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWe and Pantheon each appointed two members to PSLF's four-person Member Designees' Committee (the Member Designees' Committee\u201d). All material decisions with respect to PSLF, including those involving its investment portfolio, require unanimous approval of a quorum of the Member Designees' Committee. Quorum is defined as (i) the presence of two members of the Member Designees' Committee; provided that at least one individual is present that was elected, designated or appointed by each of us and Pantheon; (ii) the presence of three members of Member Designees' Committee, provided that the individual that was elected, designated or appointed us or Pantheon, as the case may be, with only one individual present shall be entitled to cast two votes on each matter; and (iii) the presence of four members of the Member Designees' Committee shall constitute a quorum, provided that two individuals are present that were elected, designated or appointed by each of us and Pantheon.\nAdditionally, as of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, our asset coverage ratio, as computed in accordance with the 1940 Act, was 221% and 208%, respectively. The Truist Credit Facility includes standard covenants and events of default provisions. If we fail to make the required payments or breach the covenants therein, it could result in a default under the Truist Credit Facility. Failure to cure such default or obtain a waiver from the appropriate party would result in an event of default, and the lenders may accelerate the repayment of our indebtedness under the Truist Credit Facility, such that all amounts owed are due immediately at the time of default. Such an action would negatively affect our liquidity, business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.\nTable 248: <table> <tr> <td> Statements of Assets and Liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 30, 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 30, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investments (cost-$405,009,393 and $358,023,408, respectively)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 405,232,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 353,366,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents (cost-$11,013,454 and $7,536,719, respectively)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,013,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,536,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,175,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 877,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 417,421,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 361,780,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Distribution payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,800,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,393,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Payable for investments purchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,792,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,700,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit facility payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 224,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 213,500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes payable to members\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 106,040,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 87,500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payable on credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,499,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,649,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payable on members notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,643,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,356,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accrued other expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 612,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 315,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 349,388,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 311,415,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commitments and contingencies (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Members' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68,032,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,364,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total liabilities and members' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 417,421,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 361,780,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur operating activities provided cash of $7.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, and our financing activities used cash of $(13.4) million for the same period.

</tr>\n</table>\nWe are also subject to financial risks, including changes in market interest rates. As of September 30, 2021, our debt portfolio consisted of 92% variable-rate investments. The variable-rate loans are usually based on a floating interest rate index such as LIBOR and typically have durations of three months after which they reset to current market interest rates. Variable-rate investments subject to a floor generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to nine months only if the index exceeds the floor. In addition, the Truist Credit Facility also has floating rate interest provisions, with pricing set at 225 basis points over LIBOR (or an alternative risk-free floating interest rate index). In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks have reduced interest rates, which has caused LIBOR to decrease. Due to such rates, our gross investment income may decrease, which could result in a decrease in our net investment income if such decreases in LIBOR are not offset by, among other things, a corresponding increase in the spread over LIBOR that we earn on such loans or a decrease in the interest rate of our floating interest rate liabilities tied to LIBOR.

investments at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process, as described in this Report. With respect to investments for which there is no readily available market value, the factors that our board of directors may take into account in pricing our investments at fair value include, as relevant, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate or revise our valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the price used in an actual transaction may be different than our valuation and the difference may be material.\nTable 238: <table> <tr> <td> Class and Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total Amount\nOutstanding (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Asset Coverage\nPer

During the year ended September 30, 2019, we repurchased 2.0 million shares of common stock, respectively, in open market transactions for an aggregate cost (including transaction costs) of $14.5 million. From May 9, 2018 through the program's expiration, we purchased 4.0 million shares of common stock in open market transactions for an aggregate cost (including transaction costs) of $29.5 million.\n \u2022 the ability of our prospective portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; \n * all other expenses incurred by either the Administrator or us in connection with administering our business, including payments under our Administration Agreement that will be based upon our allocable portion of overhead, and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under our Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs. \nSet forth below are the results of operations for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020.

We have adopted the principles under ASC Subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments, or ASC 825-10, which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value, and made an irrevocable election to apply ASC 825-10 to our Credit Facilities and, prior to their redemption, the 2019 Notes. We elected to use the fair value option for the Credit Facilities and, prior to their redemption, the 2019 Notes to align the measurement attributes of both our assets and liabilities while mitigating volatility in earnings from using different measurement attributes. Due to that election and in accordance with GAAP, we incurred expenses of zero, zero and $7.1 million relating to amendment costs on the Credit Facilities during the years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. ASC 825-10 establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities and to more easily understand the effect on earnings of a company's choice to use fair value. ASC 825-10 also requires entities to display the fair value of the selected assets and liabilities on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and changes in fair value of the Credit Facilities and, prior to their redemption, the 2019 Notes are reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We elect not to apply ASC 825-10 to any other financial assets or liabilities, including the 2024 Notes, 2026 Notes and SBA debentures.\n\nOverview\n * costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act, the 1958 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws; and \nSBIC II is able to borrow funds from the SBA against regulatory capital (which approximates equity capital) that is paid-in and is subject to customary regulatory requirements including an examination by the SBA. We have funded SBIC II with $75.0 million of equity capital and it had SBA debentures outstanding of $63.5 million as of September 30, 2021. SBA debentures are non-recourse to us and may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA debentures is fixed at the time of issuance, often referred to as pooling, at a market-driven spread over 10-year U.S. Treasury Notes. Under current SBA regulations, a SBIC may individually borrow to a maximum of $175.0 million, which is up to twice its potential regulatory capital, and as part of a group of SBICs under common control may borrow a maximum of $350.0 million in the aggregate.\nASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchies:\nWe provide capital to PSLF in the form of subordinated notes and equity interests. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020 we and Pantheon owned 60.5% and 39.5%, and 72.0% and 28.0%, respectively, of each of the outstanding subordinated notes and equity interests of PSLF. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020 , our investment in PSLF consisted of subordinated notes of $64.2 million and equity interests of $41.2 million and $63.0 million and equity interests of $36.3 million, respectively.\nIf any of our contractual obligations discussed above are terminated, our costs under new agreements that we enter into may increase. In addition, we will likely incur significant time and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under our Investment Management Agreement and our Administration Agreement. Any new investment management agreement would also be subject to approval by our stockholders.\n (2) The asset coverage ratio for a class of senior securities representing indebtedness is calculated as our consolidated total assets, less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, divided by senior securities representing indebtedness at par. This asset coverage ratio is multiplied by $1,000 to determine the Asset Coverage Per Unit. (3) These amounts exclude SBA debentures from our total amount outstanding and asset coverage per unit computation pursuant to an exemptive relief letter provided by the SEC in June 2011. (4) The average market value per unit is derived based on the daily closing price of the 2024 Notes trading on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol PNNTG.\u201d The 2024 Notes were issued in increments of $25 per unit and commenced trading on September 30, 2019. (5) The average market value per unit is derived based on the monthly average closing price of the 2025 Notes, which were traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the symbol PNTA\u201d since issuance. The 2025 Notes were issued in increments of $25 per unit. On June 29, 2017, the 2025 Notes were redeemed in full. \nAs of September 30, 2021, our portfolio totaled $1,255.3 million and consisted of $552.5 million of first lien secured debt, $176.9 million of second lien secured debt, $121.2 million of subordinated debt (including $64.2 million in PSLF) and $404.7 million of preferred and common equity (including $41.2 million in PSLF). Our debt portfolio consisted of 92% variable-rate investments and 8% fixed-rate investments. As of September 30, 2021, we had no portfolio companies on non-accrual. Overall, the portfolio had net unrealized appreciation of $34.2 million as of September 30, 2021. Our overall portfolio consisted of 97 companies with an average investment size of $12.9 million, had a weighted average yield on interest bearing debt investments of 9.0% and was invested 44% in first lien secured debt, 14% in second lien secured debt, 10% in subordinated debt (including 5% in PSLF) and 32% in preferred and common equity (including 3% in PSLF). As of September 30, 2021, all of the investments held by PSLF were first lien secured debt.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.\u201d The guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contract modifications, hedging relationships and other transactions, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of the reference rate reform. ASU 2020-04 is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company is evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company's financial statements.\nBecause federal income tax regulations differ from GAAP, distributions characterized in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and net realized gain recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences between tax regulations and GAAP may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified among capital accounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements to reflect their appropriate tax character. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future.\nFor more information regarding our borrowing arrangements, see Business-Leverage\u201d above.\n * fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; \nNet expenses for the year ended September 30, 2021 totaled $45.1 million. Base management fee for the same period totaled $17.3 million, incentive fee totaled $0.6 million, debt related interest and other financing expenses totaled $22.5 million and general and administrative expenses totaled $4.1 million. The decrease in expenses over the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in debt related expenses and a decrease in incentive fees.as well as the incentive fee waiver.\n Level 3: Inputs that are unobservable for an asset or liability because they are based on our own assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability. \nOur portfolio generally consists of illiquid securities, including debt and equity investments. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or for which market quotations are deemed not reflective of the fair value, our board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\n \u2022 disruptions to supply-chains and price volatility; \nWe have entered into certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. Under our Investment Management Agreement, which was reapproved by our board of directors (including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us or the Investment Adviser) in February 2021 PennantPark Investment Advisers serves as our investment adviser. PennantPark Investment, through the Investment Adviser, provides similar services to SBIC II under its investment management agreement with us. SBIC II's investment management agreement does not affect the management or incentive fees that we pay to the Investment Adviser on a consolidated basis. Payments under our Investment Management Agreement in each reporting period are equal to (1) a management fee equal to a percentage of the value of our average adjusted gross assets and (2) an incentive fee based on our performance.\nOn October 14, 2021, we announced that we will redeem $86,250,000 in principal amount of the 2024 Notes in full on November 13, 2021. We redeemed in full the 2024 Notes with a principal amount of $86.3 million on November 13, 2021. The 2024 Notes were redeemed at a redemption price of $25 per 2024 Note, plus accrued and unpaid interest payments otherwise payable for the then-current quarterly interest period accrued to, but excluding, November 13, 2021.\nSales and repayments of investments for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 totaled $434.5 million and $162.7 million, respectively, and net realized gain (loss) totaled $30.0 million and ($20.8) million, respectively. The change in realized gains/losses was primarily due to changes in the market conditions of our investments and the values at which they were realized, caused by the fluctuations in the market and in the economy, as discussed above under COVID-19 Developments\u201d.\n\n \u2022 the impact of future legislation and regulation on our business and our portfolio companies; and \nSubsequent to quarter end, PNNT had new funded investment of $97.8 million, net of sales and repayments.\nInvestment income for the year ended September 30, 2021 was $81.6 million and was attributable to $47.0 million from first lien secured debt, $20.2 million from second lien secured debt and $7.0 million from subordinated debt and $7.4 from preferred and common equity. The decrease in investment income over the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in LIBOR and a lower average investment balance.\n \u2022 our business prospects and the prospects of our prospective portfolio companies, including as a result of the current pandemic caused by COVID-19 or any worsening there of; \nItem 7.\nAlthough net assets and fair values are presented based on the applicable foreign exchange rates described above, we do not isolate that portion of the results of operations due to changes in foreign exchange rates on investments, other assets and debt from the fluctuations arising from changes in fair values of investments and liabilities held. Such fluctuations are included with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments and liabilities.\n</td> </tr>\nInformation about our senior securities is shown in the following table as of September 30, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012. The report of RSM US LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, on the Senior Securities table as of September 30, 2021, is attached as an exhibit to this Report.\nBelow is a summary of PSLF's portfolio at fair value:\nGenerally, during periods of asset growth, we expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or to decline as a percentage of total assets and increase during periods of asset declines. Incentive fees, interest expense and costs relating to future offerings of securities would be additive to the expenses described above.\n (1) Our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of our Investment Adviser responsible for the portfolio investment; \n (1) Excluding 3.4% of upfront fees. \nWe intend to continue to make quarterly distributions to our stockholders. Our quarterly distributions, if any, are determined by our board of directors.\nOur operating activities used cash of $129.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2020, and our financing activities provided cash of $95.8 million for the same period. Our operating activities used cash primarily for our investment activities and our financing activities provided cash primarily for net borrowings under our Credit Facilities.\n * fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs; \nWe believe middle-market companies offer attractive risk-reward to investors due to a limited amount of capital available for such companies. We seek to create a diversified portfolio that includes first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and equity investments by investing approximately $10 million to $50 million of capital, on average, in the securities of middle-market companies. We expect this investment size to vary proportionately with the size of our capital base. We use the term middle-market\u201d to refer to companies with annual revenues between $50 million and $1 billion. The companies in which we invest are typically highly leveraged, and, in most cases, are not rated by national rating agencies. If such companies were rated, we believe that they would typically receive a rating below investment grade (between BB and CCC under the Standard & Poor's system) from the national rating agencies. Securities rated below investment grade are often referred to as leveraged loans\u201d or high yield\u201d securities or junk bonds\u201d and are often higher risk compared to debt instruments that are rated above investment grade and have speculative characteristics. Our debt investments may generally range in maturity from three to ten years and are made to U.S. and, to a limited extent, non-U.S. corporations, partnerships and other business entities which operate in various industries and geographical regions.\nExpenses\nThe business disruption and financial harm resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic experienced by some of our portfolio companies may reduce, over time, the amount of interest and dividend income that we receive from such investments and may require us to provide an increase of capital to such companies in the form of follow on investments. In connection with the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may also need to restructure the capitalization of some of our portfolio companies, which could result in reduced interest payments, an increase in the amount of PIK interest we receive or a permanent reduction in the value of our investments. If our net investment income decreases, the percentage of our cash flows dedicated to debt servicing and distribution payments to stockholders would subsequently increase. This has required us to reduce the amount of our distributions to stockholders as compared to distributions in previous years. Although we had no non-accrual assets during the quarter ended September 30, 2021, the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or any worsening thereof, may result in portfolio investments being placed on non-accrual status in the future.\nNet investment income totaled $36.5 million, or $0.54 per share, and $38.7 million, or $0.58 per share, for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in net investment income per share compared to the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in LIBOR.\nPennantPark Senior Loan Fund, LLC\nAlthough we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and, as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. Important assumptions include our ability to originate new loans and investments, certain margins and levels of profitability and the availability of additional capital. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward- looking statement in this Report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved.\n \u2022 the impact of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union and other world economic and political issues. \nDistributions\nPennantPark Investment Corporation, a Maryland corporation organized in January 2007, is a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified investment company that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for federal income tax purposes we have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code.\nInvestment Valuations\nAs of September 30, 2021, we had the multi-currency Truist Credit Facility for up to $435.0 million (decreased from $475.0 million on May 25, 2021 pursuant to its terms) in borrowings with certain lenders and Truist Bank (formerly SunTrust Bank), acting as administrative agent, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., acting as syndication agent for the lenders. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, we had $316.5 million and $388.3 million, respectively, in outstanding borrowings under the Truist Credit Facility. The Truist Credit Facility had a weighted average interest rate of 2.4% and 2.5%, respectively, exclusive of the fee on undrawn commitments, as of September 30, 2021 and 2020. The Truist Credit Facility is a revolving facility with a stated maturity date of September 4, 2024, a one-year term-out period on September 4, 2023 and pricing set at 225 basis points over LIBOR (or an alternative risk-free floating interest rate index). As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, we had $118.5 million and $86.7 million of unused borrowing capacity under the Truist Credit Facility, respectively, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions. The Truist Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets excluding assets held by SBIC II. As of September 30, 2021, we were in compliance with the terms of the Truist Credit Facility.\nThis Report, including Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains statements that constitute forward-looking statements, which relate to us and our consolidated subsidiaries regarding future events or our future performance or future financial condition. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our Company, our industry, our beliefs and our assumptions. The forward-looking statements contained in this Report involve risks and uncertainties, including statements as to:\nFor the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, our Credit Facilities had a net change in unrealized (appreciation) depreciation of $(17.8) million and $12.3 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, our net unrealized depreciation on our Credit Facilities totaled $1.7 million and $19.6 million, respectively. The net change in unrealized depreciation for the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to the prior year was primarily due to changes in the capital markets, as further discussed above under COVID-19 Developments\u201d.\n 1. Fair value of investment securities, other assets and liabilities - at the exchange rates prevailing at the end of the applicable period; and \n (1) Represents floating rate instruments that accrue interest at a predetermined spread relative to an index, typically the applicable LIBOR, or L\u201d or Prime rate or P\u201d. The spread may change based on the type of rate used. The terms in the Schedule of Investments disclose the actual interest rate in effect as of the reporting period. LIBOR loans are typically indexed to a 30-day, 60-day, 90-day or 180-day LIBOR rate (1M L, 2M L, 3M L, or 6M L, respectively), at the borrower's option. All securities are subject to a LIBOR or Prime rate floor where a spread is provided, unless noted. The spread provided includes PIK interest and other fee rates, if any. \nWe have formed and expect to continue to form certain taxable subsidiaries, including the Taxable Subsidiaries, which are subject to tax as corporations. These taxable subsidiaries allow us to hold equity securities of certain portfolio companies treated as pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes while facilitating our ability to qualify as a RIC under the Code.\nFor the period ended July 31, 2020 through September 30, 2020, PSLF invested $5.7 million in one new portfolio company with a weighted average yield on debt investments of 7.5%. PSLF's sales and repayments of investments for the same period totaled $11.1 million.\nTable 253: <table> <tr> <td>\nThe annualized weighted average cost of debt for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, inclusive of the fee on the undrawn commitment and amendment costs on the Credit Facilities, amortized upfront fees on SBA debentures and debt retirement and issuance costs, was 3.5% and 4.0%, respectively.\nRecent Developments\nYou should understand that under Section 27A(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Act and Section 21E(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, the safe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 do not apply to forward-looking statements made in periodic reports we file under the Exchange Act.\nNet Investment Income\n * the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services; \nThe SBIC program is designed to stimulate the flow of capital into eligible businesses. Under SBA regulations, SBIC II is subject to regulatory requirements, including making investments in SBA eligible businesses, investing at least 25% of regulatory capital in eligible smaller businesses, as defined under the 1958 Act, placing certain limitations on the financing terms of investments, prohibiting investment in certain industries and requiring capitalization thresholds that limit distributions to us, and are subject to periodic audits and examinations of their financial statements that are prepared on a basis of accounting other than GAAP (for example, fair value, as defined under ASC 820, is not required to be used for assets or liabilities for such compliance reporting). As of September 30, 2021, SBIC II was in compliance with their regulatory requirements.\nExpenses\n * direct costs such as printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff; \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nA financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Generally, most of our investments, our Credit Facilities, 2026 Notes and our SBA debentures are classified as Level 3. Our 2019 Notes were, and our 2024 Notes are, classified as Level 2 as they were valued using the closing price from the primary exchange. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the price used in an actual transaction may be different than our valuation and those differences may be material.\nInvestment Income\n \u2022 our expected financings and investments; \n * fidelity bond, directors and officers, errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums; \n \u2022 the impact of price and volume fluctuations in the stock market; \n \u2022 the valuation of our investments in portfolio companies, particularly those having no liquid trading market; \n \u2022 the ability of our Investment Adviser to locate suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments; \nWe may raise additional equity or debt capital through both registered offerings off our shelf registration statement and private offerings of securities, by securitizing a portion of our investments or borrowing from the SBA, among other sources. Any future additional debt capital we incur, to the extent it is available, may be issued at a higher cost and on less favorable terms and conditions than our current Credit Facility or SBA debentures. Furthermore, our Credit Facility availability depends on various covenants and restrictions. The primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for repayment of indebtedness, investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our stockholders or for other general corporate or strategic purposes such as our stock repurchase program.\nWe record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt investments with contractual PIK interest, which represents interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we will generally not accrue PIK interest when the portfolio company valuation indicates that such PIK interest is not collectable. We do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt investments if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Loan origination fees, OID, market discount or premium and deferred financing costs on liabilities, which we do not fair value, are capitalized and then accreted or amortized using the effective interest method as interest income or, in the case of deferred financing costs, as interest expense. We record prepayment penalties on loans and debt investments as income. Dividend income, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis on the ex-dividend date to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. From time to time, the Company receives certain fees from portfolio companies, which are non-recurring in nature. Such fees include loan prepayment penalties, structuring fees and amendment fees, and are recorded as other investment income when earned.\nBelow is a listing of PSLF's individual investments as of September 30, 2021:\n (1) PSLF commenced operations on July 31, 2020. \n\nFor the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, we reported net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments of $117.9 million and ($46.2) million, respectively. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, our net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments totaled $34.2 million and ($83.8) million, respectively. The net change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on our investments for the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to the prior year was primarily due to changes in the capital market conditions of our investments and the values at which they were realized, caused by the fluctuation in the market and in the economy, as discussed above under COVID-19 Developments.\u201d\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n</table>\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, we declared distributions of $0.48 per share and $0.60 per share, respectively, for total distributions of $32.2 million and $40.2 million. We monitor available net investment income to determine if a return of capital for tax purposes may occur for the fiscal year. To the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for any given fiscal year, stockholders will be notified of the portion of those distributions deemed to be a tax return of capital. Tax characteristics of all distributions will be reported to stockholders subject to information reporting on Form 1099-DIV after the end of each calendar year and in our periodic reports filed with the SEC.\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of a management fee and the payment of an incentive fee to our Investment Adviser, if any, our allocable portion of overhead under our Administration Agreement and other operating costs as detailed below. Our management fee compensates our Investment Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, consummating and monitoring our investments. Additionally, we pay interest expense on the outstanding debt and unused commitment fees on undrawn amounts, under our various debt facilities. We bear all other direct or indirect costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including:\nOur liquidity and capital resources are derived primarily from proceeds of securities offerings, debt capital and cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments, and income earned. Our primary use of funds from operations includes investments in portfolio companies and payments of fees and other operating expenses we incur. We have used, and expect to continue to use, our debt capital, proceeds from the rotation of our portfolio and proceeds from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives. As of September 30, 2021, in accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to borrow amounts such that we are in compliance with a 150% asset coverage ratio requirement after such borrowing, excluding SBA debentures pursuant to exemptive relief from the SEC received in June 2011. This Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section should be read in conjunction with the COVID-19 Developments\u201d section above.\n \u2022 our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; \n (2) Valued based on PSLF's accounting policy. \nOn February 5, 2019, our stockholders approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 (which includes the SBCAA) as approved by our board of directors on November 13, 2018. As a result, the asset coverage requirement applicable to us for senior securities was reduced from 200% (i.e., $1 of debt outstanding for each $1 of equity) to 150% (i.e., $2 of debt outstanding for each $1 of equity), subject to compliance with certain disclosure requirements.\nAs of September 30, 2021, PSLF's portfolio totaled $405.2 million, consisted of 47 companies with an average investment size of $8.6 million and had a weighted average yield on debt investments of 7.1%. For the year ended September 30, 2020, PSLF's portfolio totaled $353.4 million, consisted of 37 companies with an average investment size of $9.6 million and had a weighted average yield on debt investments of 7.3%.\nIn addition to using the above inputs to value cash equivalents, investments, our 2019 Notes, our SBA debentures, our 2024 Notes, our 2026 Notes and our Credit Facilities valuations, we employ the valuation policy approved by our board of directors that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with our valuation policy, we evaluate the source of inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading, in determining fair value.\nPennantPark Investment Corporation is a BDC whose objectives are to generate both current income and capital appreciation while seeking to preserve capital through debt and equity investments primarily made to U.S. middle-market companies in the form of first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and equity investments.\nWe have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually to maintain our election to be treated, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our RIC tax election, we must, among other requirements, meet certain annual source-of-income and quarterly asset diversification requirements. We also must annually distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders out of the assets legally available for distribution of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of the sum of our net ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, or investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid.\n * transfer agent and custodial fees; \nForeign Currency Translation\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n (2) Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the management of the Investment Adviser; \n \u2022 U.S. and global economic recovery; \n (3) Our board of directors also engages independent valuation firms to conduct independent appraisals of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment. The independent valuation firms review management's preliminary valuations in light of their own independent assessment and also in light of any market quotations obtained from an independent pricing service, broker, dealer or market maker; \nWe generate revenue in the form of interest income on the debt securities we hold and capital gains and dividends, if any, on investment securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Our debt investments, whether in the form of first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt or subordinated debt, typically have a term of three to ten years and bear interest at a fixed or a floating rate. Interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semiannually. In some cases, our investments provide for deferred interest payments and PIK interest. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest generally becomes due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of amendment, commitment, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing significant managerial assistance and possibly consulting fees. Loan origination fees, OID and market discount or premium and deferred financing costs on liabilities, which we do not fair value, are capitalized and accreted or amortized using the effective interest method as interest income or, in the case of deferred financing costs, as interest expense. Dividend income, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis on the ex-dividend date to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. From time to time, the Company receives certain fees from portfolio companies, which are non-recurring in nature. Such fees include loan prepayment penalties, structuring fees and amendment fees, and are recorded as other investment income when earned.\n\nPORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY\nBelow is a listing of PSLF's individual investments as of: September 30, 2020\nOur board of directors generally uses market quotations to assess the value of our investments for which market quotations are readily available. We obtain these market values from independent pricing services or at the bid prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers, if available, or otherwise from a principal market maker or a primary market dealer. The Investment Adviser assesses the source and reliability of bids from brokers or dealers. If our board of directors has a bona fide reason to believe any such market quote does not reflect the fair value of an investment, it may independently value such investments by using the valuation procedure that it uses with respect to assets for which market quotations are not readily available.\nIn July 2020, we and Pantheon formed PSLF, an unconsolidated joint venture. PSLF invests primarily in middle-market and other corporate debt securities consistent with our strategy. PSLF was formed as a Delaware limited liability company. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020 PSLF had total assets of $417.4 million and $361.8 million, respectively. PSLF's portfolio consisted of debt investments in 47 and 37 portfolio companies as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of September 30, 2021, at fair value, the largest investment in a single portfolio company in PSLF was $16.8 million and the five largest investments totaled $74.4 million. As of September 30, 2020, at fair value, the largest investment in a single portfolio company in PSLF was $18.4 million and the five largest investments totaled $77.9 million. PSLF invests in portfolio companies in the same industries in which we may directly invest.\n \u2022 the impact of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our business and our portfolio companies; \n (2) No management or incentive fees are payable by PSLF. \nFor the year ended September 30, 2021, PSLF invested $149.4 million (of which $123.4 million was purchased from the Company) in 18 new and nine existing portfolio companies with a weighted average yield on debt investments of 7.3%. PSLF's sales and repayments of investments for the same period totaled $104.9 million.\nOur investment activities are managed by the Investment Adviser. Under our Investment Management Agreement, we have agreed to pay our Investment Adviser an annual base management fee based on our average adjusted gross assets as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. PennantPark Investment, through the Investment Adviser, provides similar services to SBIC II under its investment management agreement. SBIC II's investment management agreement does not affect the management and incentive fees on a consolidated basis. We have also entered into an Administration Agreement with the Administrator. Under our Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under our Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs. PennantPark Investment, through the Administrator, provides similar services to SBIC II under its administration agreement with us. Our board of directors, a majority of whom are independent of us, provides overall supervision of our activities, and the Investment Adviser supervises our day-to-day activities.\n (2) Valued based on PSLF's accounting policy. \nRevenues\nSenior Securities\nFor the year ended September 30, 2021, the Credit Facility had a net change in unrealized appreciation of $17.8 million. For the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Credit Facilities and the 2019 Notes had a net change in unrealized depreciation of $12.3 million and $5.7 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2021, the net unrealized depreciation on our Credit Facility totaled $1.7 million. As of September 30, 2020, the net unrealized depreciation on our Credit Facilities totaled $19.6 million. We use a nationally recognized independent valuation service to measure the fair value of our Credit Facilities and, prior to their redemption, the 2019 Notes in a manner consistent with the valuation process that the board of directors uses to value our investments.\n\n \u2022 the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its impact on the industries in which we invest; \nWe have investments in our portfolio which contain a PIK interest provision. PIK interest is added to the principal balance of the investment and is recorded as income. In order for us to maintain our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC, substantially all of this income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes, even though we may not have collected any cash with respect to interest on PIK securities.\n\nOur fixed-rate SBA debentures were as follows:\nAlthough not required for us to maintain our RIC tax status, in order to preclude the imposition of a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax imposed on RICs, we must distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders in respect of each calendar year an amount at least equal to the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. In addition, although we may distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions in the manner described above, we have retained and may continue to retain such net capital gains or investment company taxable income, contingent on our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC, in order to provide us with additional liquidity.\nNet change in net assets resulting from operations totaled $166.6 million, or $2.49 per share, and ($16.0) million, or ($0.24) per share, for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in net assets from operations for the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to the prior year was primarily due to appreciation of the portfolio primarily driven by recovery from the market disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainty surrounding its continued adverse economic impact, as discussed above under COVID-19 Developments.\u201d\n \u2022 our ability to continue to effectively manage our business due to the significant disruptions caused by the current COVID-19 pandemic or any worsening there of; \nAs of September 30, 2021, we had $86.3 million in aggregate principal amount of 2024 Notes outstanding. Interest on the 2024 Notes is paid quarterly on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15, at a rate of 5.5% per year, commencing January 15, 2020. The 2024 Notes mature on October 15, 2024. The 2024 Notes are direct unsecured obligations and rank pari passu in right of payment with our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness. The 2024 Notes are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our subsidiaries, financing vehicles, or similar facilities. The 2024 Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option on or after October 15, 2021 at a redemption price of 100% of the outstanding principal amount of the 2024 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nAs of both September 30, 2021 and 2020, SBIC II had an initial $150.0 million in debt commitments, all of which were drawn. During the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, $55.0 million and $31.5 million in SBA debentures were repaid, respectively. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the unamortized fees on the SBA debentures were $1.3 million and $2.7 million, respectively. The SBA debentures' upfront fees of 3.4% consist of a commitment fee of 1.0% and an issuance discount of 2.4%, which are being amortized.\n (5) Our board of directors discusses these valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith, based on the input of our Investment Adviser, the respective independent valuation firms and the audit committee. \n * the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities; \nNet Realized Gains or Losses and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation\nAs of September 30, 2021 and 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $20.4 million and $25.8 million, respectively, available for investing and general corporate purposes. We believe our liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to take advantage of market opportunities.\nIn accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, PennantPark Investment is only allowed to borrow amounts such that our required 150% asset coverage ratio is met after such borrowing. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, we excluded the principal amounts of our SBA debentures from our asset coverage ratio pursuant to SEC exemptive relief. In 2011, we received exemptive relief from the SEC allowing us to modify the asset coverage ratio requirement to exclude the SBA debentures from the calculation. Accordingly, our ratio of total assets on a consolidated basis to outstanding indebtedness may be less than 150% which, while providing increased investment flexibility, also increases our exposure to risks associated with leverage.\nFederal Income Taxes\nRevenue Recognition\nOrganization and Structure of PennantPark Investment Corporation\nAlthough not required for us to maintain our RIC tax status, in order to preclude the imposition of a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax imposed on RICs, we must distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders in respect of each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income (subject to certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of the excess, if any, of our capital gains over our capital losses, or capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year plus (3) the sum of any net ordinary income plus capital gain net income for preceding years that was not distributed during such years and on which we did not incur any U.S. federal income tax, or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. In addition, although we may distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions in the manner described above, we have retained and may continue to retain such net capital gains or investment company taxable income, contingent on maintaining our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC, in order to provide us with additional liquidity.\nNet Realized Gains or Losses\n (1) Total cost of each class of senior securities outstanding at the end of the period presented in thousands (000s). \n (1) For the years ended of September 30, 2021 and 2020, PSLF did not have any unfunded commitments to fund investments. \nFor the year ended September 30, 2021, we invested $441.4 million of investments in 30 new and 49 existing portfolio companies with a weighted average yield on debt investments of 8.1%. Sales and repayments of investments for the same period totaled $434.5 million.\nThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of our assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported periods. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary for the fair presentation of financial statements have been included. Actual results could differ from these estimates due to changes in the economic and regulatory environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates and assumptions, including the credit worthiness of our portfolio companies and the global outbreak of COVID-19. We may reclassify certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. We have eliminated all intercompany balances and transactions. References to ASC serve as a single source of accounting literature. Subsequent events are evaluated and disclosed as appropriate for events occurring through the date the Consolidated Financial Statements are issued. In addition to the discussion below, we describe our critical accounting policies in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCOVID-19 was first detected in December 2019 and has since been identified as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. The effect of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or any worsening thereof, uncertainty relating to more contagious strains of the virus, the length of recovery of certain economic sectors in the U.S. and globally and the speed and efficiency of the vaccination process, including the extent to which the available vaccines are ineffective against any new COVID- 19 variants may create stress on the market and may affect some of our portfolio companies. We cannot predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including any worsening thereof or its duration in the United States and globally and any impact to our business operations or the business operations of our portfolio companies. Depending on the length and magnitude of the disruption to the operations of our portfolio companies, certain portfolio companies may experience financial distress and possibly default on their financial obligations to us and their other capital providers in the future. These developments could impact the value of our investments in such portfolio companies.\nAs of September 30, 2021 and 2020, our asset coverage ratio, as computed in accordance with the 1940 Act, was 221% and 208%, respectively.\nAdditionally, PSLF, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, or PSLF Subsidiary, has entered into a $275.0 million (increased from $250.0 million on November 6, 2020) senior secured revolving credit facility which bears interest at LIBOR (or an alternative risk-free interest rate index) plus 260 basis points, or the PSLF Credit Facility, with BNP Paribas, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions.\nBelow is the financial information for PSLF:\n * expenses incurred by the Investment Adviser in performing due diligence and reviews of investments; \n \u2022 the impact of investments that we expect to make; \nInvestment income for the year ended September 30, 2020 was $100.2 million and was attributable to $63.4 million from first lien secured debt, $25.9 million from second lien secured debt and $8.7 million from subordinated debt and $2.2 from preferred and common equity.\nWe maintain an opt out\u201d dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a distribution, then stockholders' cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, unless they specifically opt out\u201d of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash distributions.\nNet expenses for the year ended September 30, 2020 totaled $61.5 million. Base management fee for the same period totaled $18.6 million, incentive fee totaled $2.7 million (after a waiver of $1.9 million), debt related interest and other financing expenses totaled $34.4 million (including one-time costs of $2.2 million associated with the PSLF transaction) and general and administrative expenses totaled $4.7 million.\nPayment-in-Kind, or, PIK Interest\nOur books and records are maintained in U.S. dollars. Any foreign currency amounts are translated into U.S. dollars on the following basis:\n \u2022 the impact of a protracted decline in the liquidity of credit markets on our business; \n \u2022 our future operating results; \nOur investment activity depends on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. We have used, and expect to continue to use, our debt capital, proceeds from the rotation of our portfolio and proceeds from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives.\n * fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments, including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence and reviews of prospective investments or complementary businesses; \nIn order to be treated as a RIC for federal income tax purposes and to not be subject to corporate-level tax on undistributed income or gains, we are required, under Subchapter M of the Code, to annually distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders out of the assets legally available for distribution of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of our investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid.\nWe use words such as anticipates,\u201d believes,\u201d expects,\u201d intends,\u201d seeks,\u201d plans,\u201d estimates\u201d and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. You should not place undue influence on the forward-looking statements as our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements for any reason, including the factors in Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Report.\nSBIC II, our wholly-owned subsidiary, was organized as a Delaware limited partnership in 2012. SBIC II received a license from the SBA to operate as a SBIC under Section 301(c) of the 1958 Act. SBIC II's objectives are to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments generally by investing with us in SBA eligible businesses that meet the investment selection criteria used by PennantPark Investment.\n (4) The audit committee of our board of directors reviews the preliminary valuations of the Investment Adviser and those of the independent valuation firms on a quarterly basis, periodically assesses the valuation methodologies of the independent valuation firms, and responds to and supplements the valuation recommendations of the independent valuation firms to reflect any comments; and \n * independent directors' fees and expenses; \nIn addition, we have continued to implement our business continuity planning strategy. Our priority has been to safeguard the health of our employees and to ensure continuity of business operations on behalf of our investors. As a result of our business continuity planning strategy, nearly all of our employees have returned to the office. Our systems and infrastructure have continued to support our business operations. We implemented a heightened level of communication across senior management, our investment team and our board of directors, and we have proactively engaged with our vendors on a regular basis to ensure they continue to meet our criteria for business continuity.\nUnrealized Appreciation or Depreciation on Investments and Credit Facilities\nAs of September 30, 2020, our portfolio totaled $1,081.8 million and consisted of $439.0 million of first lien secured debt, $220.8 million of second lien secured debt, $113.6 million of subordinated debt (including $63.0 million in PSLF) and $308.3 million of preferred and common equity (including $36.3 million in PSLF). Our debt portfolio consisted of 93% variable-rate investments and 7% fixed-rate investments. As of September 30, 2020, we had two portfolio companies on non-accrual, representing 4.9% and 3.4% of our overall portfolio on a cost and fair value basis, respectively. Overall, the portfolio had net unrealized depreciation of $83.8 million as of September 30, 2020. Our overall portfolio consisted of 80 companies with an average investment size of $13.5 million, had a weighted average yield on interest bearing debt investments of 8.9% and was invested 41% in first lien secured debt, 20% in second lien secured debt, 10% in subordinated debt (including 6% in PSLF) and 29% in preferred and common equity (including 3% in PSLF). As of September 30, 2020, all of the investments held by PSLF were first lien secured debt.\n (1) Represents floating rate instruments that accrue interest at a predetermined spread relative to an index, typically the applicable LIBOR or L\u201d or Prime rate or P\u201d. The spread may change based on the type of rate used. The terms in the Schedule of Investments disclose the actual interest rate in effect as of the reporting period. LIBOR loans are typically indexed to a 30-day, 60-day, 90-day or 180-day LIBOR rate (1M L, 2M L, 3M L, or 6M L, respectively), at the borrower's option. All securities are subject to a LIBOR or Prime rate floor where a spread is provided, unless noted. The spread provided includes PIK interest and other fee rates, if any. \nFor the year ended September 30, 2020, we invested $319.3 million of investments in 25 new and 58 existing portfolio companies with a weighted average yield on debt investments of 8.4%. Sales and repayments of investments for the same period totaled $162.7 million.\nIn September 2014, we issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes, for net proceeds of $245.5 million after underwriting discounts and offering costs. Interest on the 2019 Notes was paid semi-annually on April 1 and October 1, at a rate of 4.5% per year. On March 4, 2019 the 2019 Notes were redeemed in full and no amounts were outstanding as of September 30, 2021. The 2019 Notes were redeemed on March 4, 2019 at a redemption price equal to $1,008.65 for each $1,000.00 of principal of notes outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest to March 4, 2019, pursuant to the indenture governing the 2019 Notes. Please refer to our indenture agreement filed as Exhibit (d)(8) to our post-effective amendment filed on January 22, 2013 and the supplemental indenture agreement filed as Exhibit (d)(11) to our post-effective amendment filed on September 23, 2014 for more information.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, including any worsening thereof, may have an adverse impact on certain sectors of the global economy. Particularly, COVID-19 presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to our future performance and financial results as well as the future performance and financial results of our portfolio companies due to the risk of any sever adverse reaction to the vaccine, politicization of the vaccination process or general public skepticism of the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. While we are unable to predict the ultimate adverse effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, or any worsening thereof, on our results of operation, we have identified certain factors that are likely to affect market, economic and geopolitical conditions, and thereby may adversely affect our business, including:\nWe measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, using the specific identification method, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering unamortized upfront fees and prepayment penalties. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in the fair values of our portfolio investments, and our Credit Facilities, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized.\n \u2022 the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our prospective portfolio companies; \nFair value, as defined under ASC 820, is the price that we would receive upon selling an investment or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction to a market participant in the principal or most advantageous market for the investment or liability. ASC 820 emphasizes that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of us. Unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available to us on the reporting period date.\nWe may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage ratio for borrowings applicable to us as a BDC under the 1940 Act and/or due to provisions in future credit facilities. If we do not distribute at least a certain percentage of our income annually, we could suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions at a particular level.\nCOVID-19 Developments\n \u2022 limited availability of credit, both in the United States and internationally; \nIn April 2021, we issued $150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes at a public offering price per note of 99.4%. Interest on the 2026 Notes is paid semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, at a rate of 4.50% per year, commencing November 1, 2021. The 2026 Notes mature on May 1, 2026 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option subject to a make-whole premium if redeemed more than three months prior to maturity. The 2026 Notes are general, unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The 2026 Notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our subsidiaries, financing vehicles, or similar facilities. We do not intend to list the 2026 Notes on any securities exchange or automated dealer quotation system.\n * federal and state registration fees and any exchange listing fees; \nThe SEC recently adopted Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act which established requirements for determining fair value in good faith purposes of the 1940 Act. We will comply with the requirement of the rule before the requirement date in 2022.\nPennantPark Senior Loan Fund, LLC\nUnder our Administration Agreement, which was most recently reapproved by our board of directors, including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us, in February 2021 the Administrator furnishes us with office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. PennantPark Investment, through the Administrator, provides similar services to SBIC II under its administration agreements, which are intended to have no effect on the consolidated administration fee. If requested to provide significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies, we or the Administrator will be paid an additional amount based on the services provided. Payment under our Administration Agreement is based upon our allocable portion of the Administrator's overhead in performing its obligations under our Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs.\n Level 1: Inputs that are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by us at the measurement date. \n * brokerage commissions; \nWe have based the forward-looking statements included in this Report on information available to us on the date of this Report, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Although we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements in this Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, you are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we in the future may file with the SEC, including reports on Form 10-Q/K and current reports on Form 8-K.\n \u2022 the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital; ", "item_7_text": "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWe and Pantheon each appointed two members to PSLF's four-person Member Designees' Committee (the Member Designees' Committee\u201d). All material decisions with respect to PSLF, including those involving its investment portfolio, require unanimous approval of a quorum of the Member Designees' Committee. Quorum is defined as (i) the presence of two members of the Member Designees' Committee; provided that at least one individual is present that was elected, designated or appointed by each of us and Pantheon; (ii) the presence of three members of Member Designees' Committee, provided that the individual that was elected, designated or appointed us or Pantheon, as the case may be, with only one individual present shall be entitled to cast two votes on each matter; and (iii) the presence of four members of the Member Designees' Committee shall constitute a quorum, provided that two individuals are present that were elected, designated or appointed by each of us and Pantheon.\nAdditionally, as of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, our asset coverage ratio, as computed in accordance with the 1940 Act, was 221% and 208%, respectively. The Truist Credit Facility includes standard covenants and events of default provisions. If we fail to make the required payments or breach the covenants therein, it could result in a default under the Truist Credit Facility. Failure to cure such default or obtain a waiver from the appropriate party would result in an event of default, and the lenders may accelerate the repayment of our indebtedness under the Truist Credit Facility, such that all amounts owed are due immediately at the time of default. Such an action would negatively affect our liquidity, business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.\nOur operating activities provided cash of $7.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, and our financing activities used cash of $(13.4) million for the same period. Our operating activities used cash primarily for our investment activities and our financing activities provided cash primarily for net repayments under our Credit Facilities and the repayment of the SBA debentures.\nWe are also subject to financial risks, including changes in market interest rates. As of September 30, 2021, our debt portfolio consisted of 92% variable-rate investments. The variable-rate loans are usually based on a floating interest rate index such as LIBOR and typically have durations of three months after which they reset to current market interest rates. Variable-rate investments subject to a floor generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to nine months only if the index exceeds the floor. In addition, the Truist Credit Facility also has floating rate interest provisions, with pricing set at 225 basis points over LIBOR (or an alternative risk-free floating interest rate index). In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks have reduced interest rates, which has caused LIBOR to decrease. Due to such rates, our gross investment income may decrease, which could result in a decrease in our net investment income if such decreases in LIBOR are not offset by, among other things, a corresponding increase in the spread over LIBOR that we earn on such loans or a decrease in the interest rate of our floating interest rate liabilities tied to LIBOR. See Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d below.\n \u2022 changes to existing laws and regulations, or the imposition of new laws and regulations; and \nNet Change in Net Assets Resulting From Operations\nWe expect that there may not be readily available market values for many of the investments which are or will be in our portfolio, and we value such investments at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process, as described in this Report. With respect to investments for which there is no readily available market value, the factors that our board of directors may take into account in pricing our investments at fair value include, as relevant, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate or revise our valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the price used in an actual transaction may be different than our valuation and the difference may be material.\n 2. Purchases and sales of investment securities, income and expenses - at the exchange rates prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions. \n \u2022 changes in interest rates, including LIBOR; \n \u2022 uncertainty regarding future governmental and regulatory policies. \n \u2022 changes in political, economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment or conditions affecting the financial and capital markets that could result in changes to the value of our assets, including changes from the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic or any worsening there of; \n\nSubsequent to September 30, 2021, we entered into an underwriting agreement, or the Underwriting Agreement, dated October 14, 2021, by and among the Company, the Investment Adviser, the Administrator and Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. and Truist Securities, Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named on Schedule A to the Underwriting Agreement, in connection with the issuance and sale of $165.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.0% Notes due 2026, or the 2026-2 Notes. On October 21, 2021, we closed the transaction and issued $165.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2026-2 Notes at a public offering price per note of 99.436%. Interest on the 2026-2 Notes is paid semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, at a rate of 4.0% per year, commencing May 1, 2022. The 2026-2 Notes mature on November 1, 2026 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option subject to a make-whole premium if redeemed more than three months prior to maturity. The 2026-2 Notes are general, unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The 2026-2 Notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our subsidiaries, financing vehicles, or similar facilities. We do not intend to list the 2026-2 Notes on any securities exchange or automated dealer quotation system.\nThe following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Report.\n * federal, state, local and foreign taxes; \n Level 2: Inputs that are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or that are quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term, if applicable, of the financial instrument. \n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOn May 9, 2018, we announced a share repurchase program which allowed us to repurchase up to $30 million of our outstanding common stock in the open market at prices below our NAV as reported in our then most recently published consolidated financial statements. The program expired on May 9, 2019. During the year ended September 30, 2019, we repurchased 2.0 million shares of common stock, respectively, in open market transactions for an aggregate cost (including transaction costs) of $14.5 million. From May 9, 2018 through the program's expiration, we purchased 4.0 million shares of common stock in open market transactions for an aggregate cost (including transaction costs) of $29.5 million.\n \u2022 the ability of our prospective portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; \n * all other expenses incurred by either the Administrator or us in connection with administering our business, including payments under our Administration Agreement that will be based upon our allocable portion of overhead, and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under our Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs. \nSet forth below are the results of operations for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. For information regarding results of operations for the year ended September 30, 2019, see the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, as filed with the SEC on November 19, 2020.\nGenerally, the carrying value of our consolidated financial liabilities approximates fair value. We have adopted the principles under ASC Subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments, or ASC 825-10, which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value, and made an irrevocable election to apply ASC 825-10 to our Credit Facilities and, prior to their redemption, the 2019 Notes. We elected to use the fair value option for the Credit Facilities and, prior to their redemption, the 2019 Notes to align the measurement attributes of both our assets and liabilities while mitigating volatility in earnings from using different measurement attributes. Due to that election and in accordance with GAAP, we incurred expenses of zero, zero and $7.1 million relating to amendment costs on the Credit Facilities during the years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. ASC 825-10 establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities and to more easily understand the effect on earnings of a company's choice to use fair value. ASC 825-10 also requires entities to display the fair value of the selected assets and liabilities on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and changes in fair value of the Credit Facilities and, prior to their redemption, the 2019 Notes are reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We elect not to apply ASC 825-10 to any other financial assets or liabilities, including the 2024 Notes, 2026 Notes and SBA debentures.\n\nOverview\n * costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act, the 1958 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws; and \nSBIC II is able to borrow funds from the SBA against regulatory capital (which approximates equity capital) that is paid-in and is subject to customary regulatory requirements including an examination by the SBA. We have funded SBIC II with $75.0 million of equity capital and it had SBA debentures outstanding of $63.5 million as of September 30, 2021. SBA debentures are non-recourse to us and may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA debentures is fixed at the time of issuance, often referred to as pooling, at a market-driven spread over 10-year U.S. Treasury Notes. Under current SBA regulations, a SBIC may individually borrow to a maximum of $175.0 million, which is up to twice its potential regulatory capital, and as part of a group of SBICs under common control may borrow a maximum of $350.0 million in the aggregate.\nASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchies:\nWe provide capital to PSLF in the form of subordinated notes and equity interests. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020 we and Pantheon owned 60.5% and 39.5%, and 72.0% and 28.0%, respectively, of each of the outstanding subordinated notes and equity interests of PSLF. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020 , our investment in PSLF consisted of subordinated notes of $64.2 million and equity interests of $41.2 million and $63.0 million and equity interests of $36.3 million, respectively.\nIf any of our contractual obligations discussed above are terminated, our costs under new agreements that we enter into may increase. In addition, we will likely incur significant time and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under our Investment Management Agreement and our Administration Agreement. Any new investment management agreement would also be subject to approval by our stockholders.\n (2) The asset coverage ratio for a class of senior securities representing indebtedness is calculated as our consolidated total assets, less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, divided by senior securities representing indebtedness at par. This asset coverage ratio is multiplied by $1,000 to determine the Asset Coverage Per Unit. (3) These amounts exclude SBA debentures from our total amount outstanding and asset coverage per unit computation pursuant to an exemptive relief letter provided by the SEC in June 2011. (4) The average market value per unit is derived based on the daily closing price of the 2024 Notes trading on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol PNNTG.\u201d The 2024 Notes were issued in increments of $25 per unit and commenced trading on September 30, 2019. (5) The average market value per unit is derived based on the monthly average closing price of the 2025 Notes, which were traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the symbol PNTA\u201d since issuance. The 2025 Notes were issued in increments of $25 per unit. On June 29, 2017, the 2025 Notes were redeemed in full. \nAs of September 30, 2021, our portfolio totaled $1,255.3 million and consisted of $552.5 million of first lien secured debt, $176.9 million of second lien secured debt, $121.2 million of subordinated debt (including $64.2 million in PSLF) and $404.7 million of preferred and common equity (including $41.2 million in PSLF). Our debt portfolio consisted of 92% variable-rate investments and 8% fixed-rate investments. As of September 30, 2021, we had no portfolio companies on non-accrual. Overall, the portfolio had net unrealized appreciation of $34.2 million as of September 30, 2021. Our overall portfolio consisted of 97 companies with an average investment size of $12.9 million, had a weighted average yield on interest bearing debt investments of 9.0% and was invested 44% in first lien secured debt, 14% in second lien secured debt, 10% in subordinated debt (including 5% in PSLF) and 32% in preferred and common equity (including 3% in PSLF). As of September 30, 2021, all of the investments held by PSLF were first lien secured debt.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.\u201d The guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contract modifications, hedging relationships and other transactions, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of the reference rate reform. ASU 2020-04 is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company is evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company's financial statements.\nBecause federal income tax regulations differ from GAAP, distributions characterized in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and net realized gain recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences between tax regulations and GAAP may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified among capital accounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements to reflect their appropriate tax character. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future.\nFor more information regarding our borrowing arrangements, see Business-Leverage\u201d above.\n * fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; \nNet expenses for the year ended September 30, 2021 totaled $45.1 million. Base management fee for the same period totaled $17.3 million, incentive fee totaled $0.6 million, debt related interest and other financing expenses totaled $22.5 million and general and administrative expenses totaled $4.1 million. The decrease in expenses over the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in debt related expenses and a decrease in incentive fees.as well as the incentive fee waiver.\n Level 3: Inputs that are unobservable for an asset or liability because they are based on our own assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability. \nOur portfolio generally consists of illiquid securities, including debt and equity investments. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or for which market quotations are deemed not reflective of the fair value, our board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\n \u2022 disruptions to supply-chains and price volatility; \nWe have entered into certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. Under our Investment Management Agreement, which was reapproved by our board of directors (including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us or the Investment Adviser) in February 2021 PennantPark Investment Advisers serves as our investment adviser. PennantPark Investment, through the Investment Adviser, provides similar services to SBIC II under its investment management agreement with us. SBIC II's investment management agreement does not affect the management or incentive fees that we pay to the Investment Adviser on a consolidated basis. Payments under our Investment Management Agreement in each reporting period are equal to (1) a management fee equal to a percentage of the value of our average adjusted gross assets and (2) an incentive fee based on our performance.\nOn October 14, 2021, we announced that we will redeem $86,250,000 in principal amount of the 2024 Notes in full on November 13, 2021. We redeemed in full the 2024 Notes with a principal amount of $86.3 million on November 13, 2021. The 2024 Notes were redeemed at a redemption price of $25 per 2024 Note, plus accrued and unpaid interest payments otherwise payable for the then-current quarterly interest period accrued to, but excluding, November 13, 2021.\nSales and repayments of investments for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 totaled $434.5 million and $162.7 million, respectively, and net realized gain (loss) totaled $30.0 million and ($20.8) million, respectively. The change in realized gains/losses was primarily due to changes in the market conditions of our investments and the values at which they were realized, caused by the fluctuations in the market and in the economy, as discussed above under COVID-19 Developments\u201d.\n\n \u2022 the impact of future legislation and regulation on our business and our portfolio companies; and \nSubsequent to quarter end, PNNT had new funded investment of $97.8 million, net of sales and repayments.\nInvestment income for the year ended September 30, 2021 was $81.6 million and was attributable to $47.0 million from first lien secured debt, $20.2 million from second lien secured debt and $7.0 million from subordinated debt and $7.4 from preferred and common equity. The decrease in investment income over the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in LIBOR and a lower average investment balance.\n \u2022 our business prospects and the prospects of our prospective portfolio companies, including as a result of the current pandemic caused by COVID-19 or any worsening there of; \nItem 7.\nAlthough net assets and fair values are presented based on the applicable foreign exchange rates described above, we do not isolate that portion of the results of operations due to changes in foreign exchange rates on investments, other assets and debt from the fluctuations arising from changes in fair values of investments and liabilities held. Such fluctuations are included with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments and liabilities.\n</td> </tr>\nInformation about our senior securities is shown in the following table as of September 30, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012. The report of RSM US LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, on the Senior Securities table as of September 30, 2021, is attached as an exhibit to this Report.\nBelow is a summary of PSLF's portfolio at fair value:\nGenerally, during periods of asset growth, we expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or to decline as a percentage of total assets and increase during periods of asset declines. Incentive fees, interest expense and costs relating to future offerings of securities would be additive to the expenses described above.\n (1) Our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of our Investment Adviser responsible for the portfolio investment; \n (1) Excluding 3.4% of upfront fees. \nWe intend to continue to make quarterly distributions to our stockholders. Our quarterly distributions, if any, are determined by our board of directors.\nOur operating activities used cash of $129.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2020, and our financing activities provided cash of $95.8 million for the same period. Our operating activities used cash primarily for our investment activities and our financing activities provided cash primarily for net borrowings under our Credit Facilities.\n * fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs; \nWe believe middle-market companies offer attractive risk-reward to investors due to a limited amount of capital available for such companies. We seek to create a diversified portfolio that includes first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and equity investments by investing approximately $10 million to $50 million of capital, on average, in the securities of middle-market companies. We expect this investment size to vary proportionately with the size of our capital base. We use the term middle-market\u201d to refer to companies with annual revenues between $50 million and $1 billion. The companies in which we invest are typically highly leveraged, and, in most cases, are not rated by national rating agencies. If such companies were rated, we believe that they would typically receive a rating below investment grade (between BB and CCC under the Standard & Poor's system) from the national rating agencies. Securities rated below investment grade are often referred to as leveraged loans\u201d or high yield\u201d securities or junk bonds\u201d and are often higher risk compared to debt instruments that are rated above investment grade and have speculative characteristics. Our debt investments may generally range in maturity from three to ten years and are made to U.S. and, to a limited extent, non-U.S. corporations, partnerships and other business entities which operate in various industries and geographical regions.\nExpenses\nThe business disruption and financial harm resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic experienced by some of our portfolio companies may reduce, over time, the amount of interest and dividend income that we receive from such investments and may require us to provide an increase of capital to such companies in the form of follow on investments. In connection with the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may also need to restructure the capitalization of some of our portfolio companies, which could result in reduced interest payments, an increase in the amount of PIK interest we receive or a permanent reduction in the value of our investments. If our net investment income decreases, the percentage of our cash flows dedicated to debt servicing and distribution payments to stockholders would subsequently increase. This has required us to reduce the amount of our distributions to stockholders as compared to distributions in previous years. Although we had no non-accrual assets during the quarter ended September 30, 2021, the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or any worsening thereof, may result in portfolio investments being placed on non-accrual status in the future.\nNet investment income totaled $36.5 million, or $0.54 per share, and $38.7 million, or $0.58 per share, for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in net investment income per share compared to the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in LIBOR.\nPennantPark Senior Loan Fund, LLC\nAlthough we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and, as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. Important assumptions include our ability to originate new loans and investments, certain margins and levels of profitability and the availability of additional capital. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward- looking statement in this Report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved.\n \u2022 the impact of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union and other world economic and political issues. \nDistributions\nPennantPark Investment Corporation, a Maryland corporation organized in January 2007, is a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified investment company that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for federal income tax purposes we have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code.\nInvestment Valuations\nAs of September 30, 2021, we had the multi-currency Truist Credit Facility for up to $435.0 million (decreased from $475.0 million on May 25, 2021 pursuant to its terms) in borrowings with certain lenders and Truist Bank (formerly SunTrust Bank), acting as administrative agent, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., acting as syndication agent for the lenders. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, we had $316.5 million and $388.3 million, respectively, in outstanding borrowings under the Truist Credit Facility. The Truist Credit Facility had a weighted average interest rate of 2.4% and 2.5%, respectively, exclusive of the fee on undrawn commitments, as of September 30, 2021 and 2020. The Truist Credit Facility is a revolving facility with a stated maturity date of September 4, 2024, a one-year term-out period on September 4, 2023 and pricing set at 225 basis points over LIBOR (or an alternative risk-free floating interest rate index). As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, we had $118.5 million and $86.7 million of unused borrowing capacity under the Truist Credit Facility, respectively, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions. The Truist Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets excluding assets held by SBIC II. As of September 30, 2021, we were in compliance with the terms of the Truist Credit Facility.\nThis Report, including Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains statements that constitute forward-looking statements, which relate to us and our consolidated subsidiaries regarding future events or our future performance or future financial condition. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our Company, our industry, our beliefs and our assumptions. The forward-looking statements contained in this Report involve risks and uncertainties, including statements as to:\nFor the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, our Credit Facilities had a net change in unrealized (appreciation) depreciation of $(17.8) million and $12.3 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, our net unrealized depreciation on our Credit Facilities totaled $1.7 million and $19.6 million, respectively. The net change in unrealized depreciation for the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to the prior year was primarily due to changes in the capital markets, as further discussed above under COVID-19 Developments\u201d.\n 1. Fair value of investment securities, other assets and liabilities - at the exchange rates prevailing at the end of the applicable period; and \n (1) Represents floating rate instruments that accrue interest at a predetermined spread relative to an index, typically the applicable LIBOR, or L\u201d or Prime rate or P\u201d. The spread may change based on the type of rate used. The terms in the Schedule of Investments disclose the actual interest rate in effect as of the reporting period. LIBOR loans are typically indexed to a 30-day, 60-day, 90-day or 180-day LIBOR rate (1M L, 2M L, 3M L, or 6M L, respectively), at the borrower's option. All securities are subject to a LIBOR or Prime rate floor where a spread is provided, unless noted. The spread provided includes PIK interest and other fee rates, if any. \nWe have formed and expect to continue to form certain taxable subsidiaries, including the Taxable Subsidiaries, which are subject to tax as corporations. These taxable subsidiaries allow us to hold equity securities of certain portfolio companies treated as pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes while facilitating our ability to qualify as a RIC under the Code.\nFor the period ended July 31, 2020 through September 30, 2020, PSLF invested $5.7 million in one new portfolio company with a weighted average yield on debt investments of 7.5%. PSLF's sales and repayments of investments for the same period totaled $11.1 million.\nTable 253: <table> <tr> <td>\nThe annualized weighted average cost of debt for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, inclusive of the fee on the undrawn commitment and amendment costs on the Credit Facilities, amortized upfront fees on SBA debentures and debt retirement and issuance costs, was 3.5% and 4.0%, respectively.\nRecent Developments\nYou should understand that under Section 27A(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Act and Section 21E(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, the safe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 do not apply to forward-looking statements made in periodic reports we file under the Exchange Act.\nNet Investment Income\n * the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services; \nThe SBIC program is designed to stimulate the flow of capital into eligible businesses. Under SBA regulations, SBIC II is subject to regulatory requirements, including making investments in SBA eligible businesses, investing at least 25% of regulatory capital in eligible smaller businesses, as defined under the 1958 Act, placing certain limitations on the financing terms of investments, prohibiting investment in certain industries and requiring capitalization thresholds that limit distributions to us, and are subject to periodic audits and examinations of their financial statements that are prepared on a basis of accounting other than GAAP (for example, fair value, as defined under ASC 820, is not required to be used for assets or liabilities for such compliance reporting). As of September 30, 2021, SBIC II was in compliance with their regulatory requirements.\nExpenses\n * direct costs such as printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff; \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nA financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Generally, most of our investments, our Credit Facilities, 2026 Notes and our SBA debentures are classified as Level 3. Our 2019 Notes were, and our 2024 Notes are, classified as Level 2 as they were valued using the closing price from the primary exchange. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the price used in an actual transaction may be different than our valuation and those differences may be material.\nInvestment Income\n \u2022 our expected financings and investments; \n * fidelity bond, directors and officers, errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums; \n \u2022 the impact of price and volume fluctuations in the stock market; \n \u2022 the valuation of our investments in portfolio companies, particularly those having no liquid trading market; \n \u2022 the ability of our Investment Adviser to locate suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments; \nWe may raise additional equity or debt capital through both registered offerings off our shelf registration statement and private offerings of securities, by securitizing a portion of our investments or borrowing from the SBA, among other sources. Any future additional debt capital we incur, to the extent it is available, may be issued at a higher cost and on less favorable terms and conditions than our current Credit Facility or SBA debentures. Furthermore, our Credit Facility availability depends on various covenants and restrictions. The primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for repayment of indebtedness, investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our stockholders or for other general corporate or strategic purposes such as our stock repurchase program.\nWe record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt investments with contractual PIK interest, which represents interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we will generally not accrue PIK interest when the portfolio company valuation indicates that such PIK interest is not collectable. We do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt investments if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Loan origination fees, OID, market discount or premium and deferred financing costs on liabilities, which we do not fair value, are capitalized and then accreted or amortized using the effective interest method as interest income or, in the case of deferred financing costs, as interest expense. We record prepayment penalties on loans and debt investments as income. Dividend income, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis on the ex-dividend date to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. From time to time, the Company receives certain fees from portfolio companies, which are non-recurring in nature. Such fees include loan prepayment penalties, structuring fees and amendment fees, and are recorded as other investment income when earned.\nBelow is a listing of PSLF's individual investments as of September 30, 2021:\n (1) PSLF commenced operations on July 31, 2020. \n\nFor the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, we reported net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments of $117.9 million and ($46.2) million, respectively. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, our net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments totaled $34.2 million and ($83.8) million, respectively. The net change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on our investments for the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to the prior year was primarily due to changes in the capital market conditions of our investments and the values at which they were realized, caused by the fluctuation in the market and in the economy, as discussed above under COVID-19 Developments.\u201d\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n</table>\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, we declared distributions of $0.48 per share and $0.60 per share, respectively, for total distributions of $32.2 million and $40.2 million. We monitor available net investment income to determine if a return of capital for tax purposes may occur for the fiscal year. To the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for any given fiscal year, stockholders will be notified of the portion of those distributions deemed to be a tax return of capital. Tax characteristics of all distributions will be reported to stockholders subject to information reporting on Form 1099-DIV after the end of each calendar year and in our periodic reports filed with the SEC.\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of a management fee and the payment of an incentive fee to our Investment Adviser, if any, our allocable portion of overhead under our Administration Agreement and other operating costs as detailed below. Our management fee compensates our Investment Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, consummating and monitoring our investments. Additionally, we pay interest expense on the outstanding debt and unused commitment fees on undrawn amounts, under our various debt facilities. We bear all other direct or indirect costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including:\nOur liquidity and capital resources are derived primarily from proceeds of securities offerings, debt capital and cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments, and income earned. Our primary use of funds from operations includes investments in portfolio companies and payments of fees and other operating expenses we incur. We have used, and expect to continue to use, our debt capital, proceeds from the rotation of our portfolio and proceeds from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives. As of September 30, 2021, in accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to borrow amounts such that we are in compliance with a 150% asset coverage ratio requirement after such borrowing, excluding SBA debentures pursuant to exemptive relief from the SEC received in June 2011. This Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section should be read in conjunction with the COVID-19 Developments\u201d section above.\n \u2022 our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; \n (2) Valued based on PSLF's accounting policy. \nOn February 5, 2019, our stockholders approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 (which includes the SBCAA) as approved by our board of directors on November 13, 2018. As a result, the asset coverage requirement applicable to us for senior securities was reduced from 200% (i.e., $1 of debt outstanding for each $1 of equity) to 150% (i.e., $2 of debt outstanding for each $1 of equity), subject to compliance with certain disclosure requirements.\nAs of September 30, 2021, PSLF's portfolio totaled $405.2 million, consisted of 47 companies with an average investment size of $8.6 million and had a weighted average yield on debt investments of 7.1%. For the year ended September 30, 2020, PSLF's portfolio totaled $353.4 million, consisted of 37 companies with an average investment size of $9.6 million and had a weighted average yield on debt investments of 7.3%.\nIn addition to using the above inputs to value cash equivalents, investments, our 2019 Notes, our SBA debentures, our 2024 Notes, our 2026 Notes and our Credit Facilities valuations, we employ the valuation policy approved by our board of directors that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with our valuation policy, we evaluate the source of inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading, in determining fair value.\nPennantPark Investment Corporation is a BDC whose objectives are to generate both current income and capital appreciation while seeking to preserve capital through debt and equity investments primarily made to U.S. middle-market companies in the form of first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and equity investments.\nWe have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually to maintain our election to be treated, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our RIC tax election, we must, among other requirements, meet certain annual source-of-income and quarterly asset diversification requirements. We also must annually distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders out of the assets legally available for distribution of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of the sum of our net ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, or investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid.\n * transfer agent and custodial fees; \nForeign Currency Translation\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n (2) Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the management of the Investment Adviser; \n \u2022 U.S. and global economic recovery; \n (3) Our board of directors also engages independent valuation firms to conduct independent appraisals of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment. The independent valuation firms review management's preliminary valuations in light of their own independent assessment and also in light of any market quotations obtained from an independent pricing service, broker, dealer or market maker; \nWe generate revenue in the form of interest income on the debt securities we hold and capital gains and dividends, if any, on investment securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Our debt investments, whether in the form of first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt or subordinated debt, typically have a term of three to ten years and bear interest at a fixed or a floating rate. Interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semiannually. In some cases, our investments provide for deferred interest payments and PIK interest. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest generally becomes due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of amendment, commitment, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing significant managerial assistance and possibly consulting fees. Loan origination fees, OID and market discount or premium and deferred financing costs on liabilities, which we do not fair value, are capitalized and accreted or amortized using the effective interest method as interest income or, in the case of deferred financing costs, as interest expense. Dividend income, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis on the ex-dividend date to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. From time to time, the Company receives certain fees from portfolio companies, which are non-recurring in nature. Such fees include loan prepayment penalties, structuring fees and amendment fees, and are recorded as other investment income when earned.\n\nPORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY\nBelow is a listing of PSLF's individual investments as of: September 30, 2020\nOur board of directors generally uses market quotations to assess the value of our investments for which market quotations are readily available. We obtain these market values from independent pricing services or at the bid prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers, if available, or otherwise from a principal market maker or a primary market dealer. The Investment Adviser assesses the source and reliability of bids from brokers or dealers. If our board of directors has a bona fide reason to believe any such market quote does not reflect the fair value of an investment, it may independently value such investments by using the valuation procedure that it uses with respect to assets for which market quotations are not readily available.\nIn July 2020, we and Pantheon formed PSLF, an unconsolidated joint venture. PSLF invests primarily in middle-market and other corporate debt securities consistent with our strategy. PSLF was formed as a Delaware limited liability company. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020 PSLF had total assets of $417.4 million and $361.8 million, respectively. PSLF's portfolio consisted of debt investments in 47 and 37 portfolio companies as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of September 30, 2021, at fair value, the largest investment in a single portfolio company in PSLF was $16.8 million and the five largest investments totaled $74.4 million. As of September 30, 2020, at fair value, the largest investment in a single portfolio company in PSLF was $18.4 million and the five largest investments totaled $77.9 million. PSLF invests in portfolio companies in the same industries in which we may directly invest.\n \u2022 the impact of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our business and our portfolio companies; \n (2) No management or incentive fees are payable by PSLF. \nFor the year ended September 30, 2021, PSLF invested $149.4 million (of which $123.4 million was purchased from the Company) in 18 new and nine existing portfolio companies with a weighted average yield on debt investments of 7.3%. PSLF's sales and repayments of investments for the same period totaled $104.9 million.\nOur investment activities are managed by the Investment Adviser. Under our Investment Management Agreement, we have agreed to pay our Investment Adviser an annual base management fee based on our average adjusted gross assets as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. PennantPark Investment, through the Investment Adviser, provides similar services to SBIC II under its investment management agreement. SBIC II's investment management agreement does not affect the management and incentive fees on a consolidated basis. We have also entered into an Administration Agreement with the Administrator. Under our Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under our Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs. PennantPark Investment, through the Administrator, provides similar services to SBIC II under its administration agreement with us. Our board of directors, a majority of whom are independent of us, provides overall supervision of our activities, and the Investment Adviser supervises our day-to-day activities.\n (2) Valued based on PSLF's accounting policy. \nRevenues\nSenior Securities\nFor the year ended September 30, 2021, the Credit Facility had a net change in unrealized appreciation of $17.8 million. For the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Credit Facilities and the 2019 Notes had a net change in unrealized depreciation of $12.3 million and $5.7 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2021, the net unrealized depreciation on our Credit Facility totaled $1.7 million. As of September 30, 2020, the net unrealized depreciation on our Credit Facilities totaled $19.6 million. We use a nationally recognized independent valuation service to measure the fair value of our Credit Facilities and, prior to their redemption, the 2019 Notes in a manner consistent with the valuation process that the board of directors uses to value our investments.\n\n \u2022 the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its impact on the industries in which we invest; \nWe have investments in our portfolio which contain a PIK interest provision. PIK interest is added to the principal balance of the investment and is recorded as income. In order for us to maintain our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC, substantially all of this income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes, even though we may not have collected any cash with respect to interest on PIK securities.\n\nOur fixed-rate SBA debentures were as follows:\nAlthough not required for us to maintain our RIC tax status, in order to preclude the imposition of a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax imposed on RICs, we must distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders in respect of each calendar year an amount at least equal to the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. In addition, although we may distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions in the manner described above, we have retained and may continue to retain such net capital gains or investment company taxable income, contingent on our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC, in order to provide us with additional liquidity.\nNet change in net assets resulting from operations totaled $166.6 million, or $2.49 per share, and ($16.0) million, or ($0.24) per share, for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in net assets from operations for the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to the prior year was primarily due to appreciation of the portfolio primarily driven by recovery from the market disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainty surrounding its continued adverse economic impact, as discussed above under COVID-19 Developments.\u201d\n \u2022 our ability to continue to effectively manage our business due to the significant disruptions caused by the current COVID-19 pandemic or any worsening there of; \nAs of September 30, 2021, we had $86.3 million in aggregate principal amount of 2024 Notes outstanding. Interest on the 2024 Notes is paid quarterly on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15, at a rate of 5.5% per year, commencing January 15, 2020. The 2024 Notes mature on October 15, 2024. The 2024 Notes are direct unsecured obligations and rank pari passu in right of payment with our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness. The 2024 Notes are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our subsidiaries, financing vehicles, or similar facilities. The 2024 Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option on or after October 15, 2021 at a redemption price of 100% of the outstanding principal amount of the 2024 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nAs of both September 30, 2021 and 2020, SBIC II had an initial $150.0 million in debt commitments, all of which were drawn. During the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, $55.0 million and $31.5 million in SBA debentures were repaid, respectively. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the unamortized fees on the SBA debentures were $1.3 million and $2.7 million, respectively. The SBA debentures' upfront fees of 3.4% consist of a commitment fee of 1.0% and an issuance discount of 2.4%, which are being amortized.\n (5) Our board of directors discusses these valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith, based on the input of our Investment Adviser, the respective independent valuation firms and the audit committee. \n * the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities; \nNet Realized Gains or Losses and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation\nAs of September 30, 2021 and 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $20.4 million and $25.8 million, respectively, available for investing and general corporate purposes. We believe our liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to take advantage of market opportunities.\nIn accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, PennantPark Investment is only allowed to borrow amounts such that our required 150% asset coverage ratio is met after such borrowing. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, we excluded the principal amounts of our SBA debentures from our asset coverage ratio pursuant to SEC exemptive relief. In 2011, we received exemptive relief from the SEC allowing us to modify the asset coverage ratio requirement to exclude the SBA debentures from the calculation. Accordingly, our ratio of total assets on a consolidated basis to outstanding indebtedness may be less than 150% which, while providing increased investment flexibility, also increases our exposure to risks associated with leverage.\nFederal Income Taxes\nRevenue Recognition\nOrganization and Structure of PennantPark Investment Corporation\nAlthough not required for us to maintain our RIC tax status, in order to preclude the imposition of a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax imposed on RICs, we must distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders in respect of each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income (subject to certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of the excess, if any, of our capital gains over our capital losses, or capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year plus (3) the sum of any net ordinary income plus capital gain net income for preceding years that was not distributed during such years and on which we did not incur any U.S. federal income tax, or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. In addition, although we may distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions in the manner described above, we have retained and may continue to retain such net capital gains or investment company taxable income, contingent on maintaining our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC, in order to provide us with additional liquidity.\nNet Realized Gains or Losses\n (1) Total cost of each class of senior securities outstanding at the end of the period presented in thousands (000s). \n (1) For the years ended of September 30, 2021 and 2020, PSLF did not have any unfunded commitments to fund investments. \nFor the year ended September 30, 2021, we invested $441.4 million of investments in 30 new and 49 existing portfolio companies with a weighted average yield on debt investments of 8.1%. Sales and repayments of investments for the same period totaled $434.5 million.\nThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of our assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported periods. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary for the fair presentation of financial statements have been included. Actual results could differ from these estimates due to changes in the economic and regulatory environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates and assumptions, including the credit worthiness of our portfolio companies and the global outbreak of COVID-19. We may reclassify certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. We have eliminated all intercompany balances and transactions. References to ASC serve as a single source of accounting literature. Subsequent events are evaluated and disclosed as appropriate for events occurring through the date the Consolidated Financial Statements are issued. In addition to the discussion below, we describe our critical accounting policies in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCOVID-19 was first detected in December 2019 and has since been identified as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. The effect of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or any worsening thereof, uncertainty relating to more contagious strains of the virus, the length of recovery of certain economic sectors in the U.S. and globally and the speed and efficiency of the vaccination process, including the extent to which the available vaccines are ineffective against any new COVID- 19 variants may create stress on the market and may affect some of our portfolio companies. We cannot predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including any worsening thereof or its duration in the United States and globally and any impact to our business operations or the business operations of our portfolio companies. Depending on the length and magnitude of the disruption to the operations of our portfolio companies, certain portfolio companies may experience financial distress and possibly default on their financial obligations to us and their other capital providers in the future. These developments could impact the value of our investments in such portfolio companies.\nAs of September 30, 2021 and 2020, our asset coverage ratio, as computed in accordance with the 1940 Act, was 221% and 208%, respectively.\nAdditionally, PSLF, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, or PSLF Subsidiary, has entered into a $275.0 million (increased from $250.0 million on November 6, 2020) senior secured revolving credit facility which bears interest at LIBOR (or an alternative risk-free interest rate index) plus 260 basis points, or the PSLF Credit Facility, with BNP Paribas, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions.\nBelow is the financial information for PSLF:\n * expenses incurred by the Investment Adviser in performing due diligence and reviews of investments; \n \u2022 the impact of investments that we expect to make; \nInvestment income for the year ended September 30, 2020 was $100.2 million and was attributable to $63.4 million from first lien secured debt, $25.9 million from second lien secured debt and $8.7 million from subordinated debt and $2.2 from preferred and common equity.\nWe maintain an opt out\u201d dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a distribution, then stockholders' cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, unless they specifically opt out\u201d of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash distributions.\nNet expenses for the year ended September 30, 2020 totaled $61.5 million. Base management fee for the same period totaled $18.6 million, incentive fee totaled $2.7 million (after a waiver of $1.9 million), debt related interest and other financing expenses totaled $34.4 million (including one-time costs of $2.2 million associated with the PSLF transaction) and general and administrative expenses totaled $4.7 million.\nPayment-in-Kind, or, PIK Interest\nOur books and records are maintained in U.S. dollars. Any foreign currency amounts are translated into U.S. dollars on the following basis:\n \u2022 the impact of a protracted decline in the liquidity of credit markets on our business; \n \u2022 our future operating results; \nOur investment activity depends on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. We have used, and expect to continue to use, our debt capital, proceeds from the rotation of our portfolio and proceeds from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives.\n * fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments, including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence and reviews of prospective investments or complementary businesses; \nIn order to be treated as a RIC for federal income tax purposes and to not be subject to corporate-level tax on undistributed income or gains, we are required, under Subchapter M of the Code, to annually distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders out of the assets legally available for distribution of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of our investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid.\nWe use words such as anticipates,\u201d believes,\u201d expects,\u201d intends,\u201d seeks,\u201d plans,\u201d estimates\u201d and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. You should not place undue influence on the forward-looking statements as our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements for any reason, including the factors in Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Report.\nSBIC II, our wholly-owned subsidiary, was organized as a Delaware limited partnership in 2012. SBIC II received a license from the SBA to operate as a SBIC under Section 301(c) of the 1958 Act. SBIC II's objectives are to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments generally by investing with us in SBA eligible businesses that meet the investment selection criteria used by PennantPark Investment.\n (4) The audit committee of our board of directors reviews the preliminary valuations of the Investment Adviser and those of the independent valuation firms on a quarterly basis, periodically assesses the valuation methodologies of the independent valuation firms, and responds to and supplements the valuation recommendations of the independent valuation firms to reflect any comments; and \n * independent directors' fees and expenses; \nIn addition, we have continued to implement our business continuity planning strategy. Our priority has been to safeguard the health of our employees and to ensure continuity of business operations on behalf of our investors. As a result of our business continuity planning strategy, nearly all of our employees have returned to the office. Our systems and infrastructure have continued to support our business operations. We implemented a heightened level of communication across senior management, our investment team and our board of directors, and we have proactively engaged with our vendors on a regular basis to ensure they continue to meet our criteria for business continuity.\nUnrealized Appreciation or Depreciation on Investments and Credit Facilities\nAs of September 30, 2020, our portfolio totaled $1,081.8 million and consisted of $439.0 million of first lien secured debt, $220.8 million of second lien secured debt, $113.6 million of subordinated debt (including $63.0 million in PSLF) and $308.3 million of preferred and common equity (including $36.3 million in PSLF). Our debt portfolio consisted of 93% variable-rate investments and 7% fixed-rate investments. As of September 30, 2020, we had two portfolio companies on non-accrual, representing 4.9% and 3.4% of our overall portfolio on a cost and fair value basis, respectively. Overall, the portfolio had net unrealized depreciation of $83.8 million as of September 30, 2020. Our overall portfolio consisted of 80 companies with an average investment size of $13.5 million, had a weighted average yield on interest bearing debt investments of 8.9% and was invested 41% in first lien secured debt, 20% in second lien secured debt, 10% in subordinated debt (including 6% in PSLF) and 29% in preferred and common equity (including 3% in PSLF). As of September 30, 2020, all of the investments held by PSLF were first lien secured debt.\n (1) Represents floating rate instruments that accrue interest at a predetermined spread relative to an index, typically the applicable LIBOR or L\u201d or Prime rate or P\u201d. The spread may change based on the type of rate used. The terms in the Schedule of Investments disclose the actual interest rate in effect as of the reporting period. LIBOR loans are typically indexed to a 30-day, 60-day, 90-day or 180-day LIBOR rate (1M L, 2M L, 3M L, or 6M L, respectively), at the borrower's option. All securities are subject to a LIBOR or Prime rate floor where a spread is provided, unless noted. The spread provided includes PIK interest and other fee rates, if any. \nFor the year ended September 30, 2020, we invested $319.3 million of investments in 25 new and 58 existing portfolio companies with a weighted average yield on debt investments of 8.4%. Sales and repayments of investments for the same period totaled $162.7 million.\nIn September 2014, we issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes, for net proceeds of $245.5 million after underwriting discounts and offering costs. Interest on the 2019 Notes was paid semi-annually on April 1 and October 1, at a rate of 4.5% per year. On March 4, 2019 the 2019 Notes were redeemed in full and no amounts were outstanding as of September 30, 2021. The 2019 Notes were redeemed on March 4, 2019 at a redemption price equal to $1,008.65 for each $1,000.00 of principal of notes outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest to March 4, 2019, pursuant to the indenture governing the 2019 Notes. Please refer to our indenture agreement filed as Exhibit (d)(8) to our post-effective amendment filed on January 22, 2013 and the supplemental indenture agreement filed as Exhibit (d)(11) to our post-effective amendment filed on September 23, 2014 for more information.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, including any worsening thereof, may have an adverse impact on certain sectors of the global economy. Particularly, COVID-19 presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to our future performance and financial results as well as the future performance and financial results of our portfolio companies due to the risk of any sever adverse reaction to the vaccine, politicization of the vaccination process or general public skepticism of the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. While we are unable to predict the ultimate adverse effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, or any worsening thereof, on our results of operation, we have identified certain factors that are likely to affect market, economic and geopolitical conditions, and thereby may adversely affect our business, including:\nWe measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, using the specific identification method, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering unamortized upfront fees and prepayment penalties. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in the fair values of our portfolio investments, and our Credit Facilities, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized.\n \u2022 the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our prospective portfolio companies; \nFair value, as defined under ASC 820, is the price that we would receive upon selling an investment or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction to a market participant in the principal or most advantageous market for the investment or liability. ASC 820 emphasizes that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of us. Unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available to us on the reporting period date.\nWe may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage ratio for borrowings applicable to us as a BDC under the 1940 Act and/or due to provisions in future credit facilities. If we do not distribute at least a certain percentage of our income annually, we could suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions at a particular level.\nCOVID-19 Developments\n \u2022 limited availability of credit, both in the United States and internationally; \nIn April 2021, we issued $150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes at a public offering price per note of 99.4%. Interest on the 2026 Notes is paid semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, at a rate of 4.50% per year, commencing November 1, 2021. The 2026 Notes mature on May 1, 2026 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option subject to a make-whole premium if redeemed more than three months prior to maturity. The 2026 Notes are general, unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The 2026 Notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our subsidiaries, financing vehicles, or similar facilities. We do not intend to list the 2026 Notes on any securities exchange or automated dealer quotation system.\n * federal and state registration fees and any exchange listing fees; \nThe SEC recently adopted Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act which established requirements for determining fair value in good faith purposes of the 1940 Act. We will comply with the requirement of the rule before the requirement date in 2022.\nPennantPark Senior Loan Fund, LLC\nUnder our Administration Agreement, which was most recently reapproved by our board of directors, including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us, in February 2021 the Administrator furnishes us with office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. PennantPark Investment, through the Administrator, provides similar services to SBIC II under its administration agreements, which are intended to have no effect on the consolidated administration fee. If requested to provide significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies, we or the Administrator will be paid an additional amount based on the services provided. Payment under our Administration Agreement is based upon our allocable portion of the Administrator's overhead in performing its obligations under our Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs.\n Level 1: Inputs that are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by us at the measurement date. \n * brokerage commissions; \nWe have based the forward-looking statements included in this Report on information available to us on the date of this Report, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.
