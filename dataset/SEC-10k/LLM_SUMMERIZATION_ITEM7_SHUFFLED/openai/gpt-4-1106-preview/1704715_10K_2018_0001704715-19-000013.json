Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis provides a narrative of our results of operations and financial condition for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (Successor), the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016 (Successor), and the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016 (Predecessor). The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes and the risk factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe discussion below contains non-GAAP financial measures.\u201d These are financial measures which either exclude or include amounts that are not excluded or included in the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). Specifically, we make use of the non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted EBITDA\u201d and Adjusted Cost of Produced Coal Sold.\u201d Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to be an alternative to net income (loss) as a measure of operating performance. The presentation of these measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.\nManagement uses non-GAAP financial measures to supplement GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the presentations of these measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and can differ significantly from company to company depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate, and capital investments.\nIncluded below are reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures.\nFormation\nContura was incorporated in the State of Delaware on June 10, 2016 to acquire and operate certain of Alpha's core coal operations, as part of the Alpha Restructuring. On July 26, 2016, a consortium of former Alpha creditors acquired our common stock in exchange for a partial release of their creditor claims pursuant to the Alpha Restructuring. Furthermore, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement between Contura and Alpha, we purchased certain former core coal operations of Alpha.\nOverview\nWe are a large-scale provider of met and thermal coal to a global customer base, operating high-quality, cost-competitive coal mines across two major U.S. coal basins (CAPP and NAPP) along with a robust Trading and Logistics business. As of December 31, 2018, our operations consisted of thirty-two active mines and twelve coal preparation and load-out facilities, with approximately 4,420 employees. We produce, process, and sell met coal and thermal coal from operations located in Virginia, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. We also sell coal produced by others, some of which is processed and/or blended with coal produced from our mines prior to resale, with the remainder purchased for resale by our trading operations. As of December 31, 2018, we had 1.3 billion tons of reserves, including 885.5 million tons of proven reserves and 462.9 million tons of probable reserves.\nWe began operations on July 26, 2016, with mining operations in NAPP, the PRB, and CAPP. Through the Acquisition, Contura acquired a significant reserve base. We also acquired Alpha's 40.6% interest in the DTA coal export terminal in eastern Virginia, and on March 31, 2017, we acquired a portion of another partner's ownership stake and increased our interest to 65.0%. On December 8, 2017, the Company closed a transaction to sell the Eagle Butte and Belle Ayr mines located in the PRB, Wyoming, along with related coal reserves, equipment, infrastructure and other real properties. The PRB results of operations and financial position are reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The historical information in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements has been restated to reflect the\neffects of the PRB operations being reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 4 for further information on discontinued operations. The Merger with Alpha Natural Resources Holdings, Inc. and ANR, Inc. was completed on November 9, 2018. Refer to Note 3 for information on terms of the Merger Agreement.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016, and the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016 sales of met coal were 11.1 million tons, 8.9 million tons, 3.1 million tons, and 2.6 million tons, respectively, and accounted for approximately 63.2%, 56.9%, 52.8%, and 36.8%, respectively, of our coal sales volume. Sales of thermal coal were 6.5 million tons, 6.7 million tons, 2.7 million tons, and 4.4 million tons, respectively, and accounted for approximately 36.8%, 43.1%, 47.2%, and 63.2%, respectively, of our coal sales volume. These results include sales from our Trading and Logistics business.\nOur sales of met coal were made primarily to steel companies in the northeastern and midwestern regions of the United States and in several countries in Europe, Asia and the Americas. Our sales of thermal coal were made primarily to large utilities and industrial customers throughout the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016, and the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016 approximately 82.7%, 77.2%, 71.2%, and 39.3%, respectively, of our total coal revenues, including freight and handling revenues, were derived from coal sales made to customers outside the United States.\nIn addition, we generate other revenues from equipment sales, rentals, terminal and processing fees, coal and environmental analysis fees, royalties and the sale of natural gas. We also record freight and handling fulfillment revenue within coal revenues for freight and handling services provided in delivering coal to certain customers, which are a component of the contractual selling price.\nOur primary expenses are operating supply costs, repair and maintenance expenditures, cost of purchased coal, royalties, wages and benefits, post-employment benefits, freight and handling costs, and taxes incurred in selling our coal. Historically, our cost of coal sales per ton is lower for sales of our produced and processed coal than for sales of purchased coal that we do not process prior to resale.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have four reportable segments: CAPP - Met, CAPP - Thermal, NAPP, and Trading and Logistics. See Note 28 for more information about our reportable segments. CAPP - Met consists of twenty-five active mines, including four mines in Virginia operated by third-party contractors, four mines operated by us in Virginia, and seventeen mines operated by us in West Virginia. CAPP - Met operations also include two preparation plants in Virginia, six preparation plants in West Virginia, as well as expenses associated with certain idled and closed mines. The coal produced by the CAPP - Met segment is predominantly met coal with some amounts of thermal coal being produced as a byproduct of mining. CAPP - Thermal consists of six active mines and three preparation plants in West Virginia, as well as expenses associated with certain idle and closed mines. The coal produced by the CAPP - Thermal segment is predominantly thermal coal with some met coal byproduct. NAPP consists of one active mine in Pennsylvania and one preparation plant, as well as expenses associated with one closed mine. Our NAPP segment produces primarily thermal coal, however, we are also able to sell part of our Cumberland coal production (0.7 and 0.2 million tons for the years ended 2018 and 2017, respectively) into the met coal market as High-Vol. B, achieving higher realized pricing than if sold as thermal coal. The Trading and Logistics segment focuses primarily on coal trading and coal terminal facility services. Our All Other category includes general corporate overhead and corporate assets and liabilities and the elimination of certain intercompany activity.\nBusiness Developments\nMerger with Alpha Natural Resources Holdings, Inc. and ANR, Inc.\nThe Merger with ANR, Inc. ( ANR\u201d) and Alpha Natural Resources Holdings, Inc. ( Holdings\u201d, and, together with ANR, the \"Alpha Companies\u201d) was completed on November 9, 2018 (the Merger\u201d or the Alpha Merger\u201d). For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Alpha Companies' financial results are included in the Financial Statements for the period from November 9, 2018 through December 31, 2018. The Alpha Companies' financial results are not included in the Financial Statements in periods prior to November 9, 2018. Refer to Note 3 for information on Alpha Merger and terms of the Merger Agreement.\nUpon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, our common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker CTRA.\u201d Previously, our shares traded on the OTC market under the ticker CNTE.\u201d\nSale of PRB Operations\nOn December 8, 2017, we closed a transaction with Blackjewel L.L.C. ( Buyer\u201d) to sell the Eagle Butte and Belle Ayr mines located in the Power River Basin ( PRB\u201d). During the permit transfer period, we will maintain the required reclamation bonds and related collateral. As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding surety bonds with a total face amount of $237.2 million to secure various obligations and commitments related to the PRB. A citizens' organization filed objections to the permit transfer with the Wyoming Environmental Quality Council on November 16, 2018. The objections are scheduled to be heard on May 15 and 16, 2019. We believe the objections are without merit. Once the permits have been transferred, we estimate approximately $12.6 million comprised of short-term restricted cash and short-term deposits will be returned to operating cash. If the permit transfer process is not completed as expected, it could have material, adverse effects on us.\nThe PRB results of operations and financial position are reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The historical information in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements has been restated to reflect the effects of the PRB operations being reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The discontinued operations include our former PRB segment. To conform with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes, the former PRB segment information for the discontinued operation has been eliminated. See Note 4 for further information on discontinued operations. The following tables summarize certain financial information relating to the PRB discontinued operating results that have been derived from our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016, and the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016.\nRevenues\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td>

required to purchase and sell coal in 2019 and 2020 totaling $16.1 million and $9.2 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we purchased and sold 5.7 million tons, totaling $62.1 million, under the Back-to-Back Coal Supply Agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we purchased and sold 2.0 million tons, totaling $21.7 million, under the Back-to-Back Coal Supply Agreements.\nDuring the third quarter of 2018, Blackjewel L.L.C. ( Blackjewel\u201d) procured surety bonds for a total of $220.5 million to facilitate the transfer of record by the State of Wyoming of the Belle Ayr and Eagle Butte mine permits from Contura Coal West, LLC to Blackjewel as required by the Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of December 7, 2017, among Blackjewel, Contura Energy, Inc. ( Contura\u201d), Contura Coal West, LLC, Contura Wyoming Land, LLC, Contura Coal Sales, LLC, and Contura Energy Services, LLC.\nContura agreed to backstop a total of $44.8 million of Blackjewel's bonding obligations with respect to the Belle Ayr and Eagle Butte permits by entering into secondary general indemnification agreements and providing letters of credit totaling $18.8 million to the sureties as collateral for Contura's indemnification obligations. This arrangement provides cost reimbursement for the issuing sureties. Indemnity bonds were issued by a third-party insurer in favor of Contura in a total amount of $26.0 million to insure Blackjewel's performance obligations to Contura with respect to cancellation of the general indemnification agreements and return of the letters of credit.\nBlackjewel agreed that, by June 30, 2019, it will (i) enter into financing arrangements of $44.8 million to be held as collateral by the sureties and (ii) cause each surety to release and return each letter of credit and cancel the Contura general indemnification agreements.\nBlackjewel's performance obligations are also collateralized by a security interest in mobile equipment granted to Contura under 8.6(c) of the Asset Purchase Agreement. Further, in connection with this arrangement, approximately $8.0 million in surety cash collateral previously supporting reclamation bonds was returned to Contura by certain of its sureties.\nDuring the third quarter of 2018, we recorded a guarantee within discontinued operations to account for the Blackjewel surety bonding arrangement with no material impact on our financial statements.\nFactors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nSales Volume. We earn revenues primarily through the sale of coal produced at our operations and resale of coal purchased from third parties. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold 5.7 million tons of met coal from CAPP - Met, CAPP - Thermal, and NAPP, 5.4 million tons of met coal from our Trading and Logistics business, 6.4 million tons of thermal coal from CAPP - Met, CAPP - Thermal, and NAPP, and 0.1 million tons of thermal coal from our Trading and Logistics business. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold 4.1 million tons of met coal from CAPP - Met and NAPP, 4.8 million tons\nof met coal from our Trading and Logistics business, and 6.7 million tons of thermal coal from CAPP - Met and NAPP. During the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016, we sold 1.6 million tons of met coal from CAPP - Met and NAPP, 1.5 million tons of met coal from our Trading and Logistics business, and 2.7 million tons of thermal coal from CAPP - Met and NAPP. During the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016, we sold 2.4 million tons of met coal from CAPP - Met and NAPP, 0.2 million tons of met coal from our Trading and Logistics business, and 4.4 million tons of thermal coal from CAPP - Met and NAPP.\nSales Agreements\nWe manage our commodity price risk for coal sales through the use of coal supply agreements. As of March 15, 2019, we expect to ship on sales commitments of approximately 6.5 million tons of NAPP coal for 2019, 96% of which is priced at an average realized price per ton of $42.85, 9.3 million tons of CAPP - Met coal for 2019, 60% of which is priced at an average realized price per ton of $123.82, and 4.9 million tons of CAPP - Thermal coal for 2019, 90% of which is priced at an average realized price per ton of $57.67.\nRealized Pricing. Our realized price per ton of coal is influenced by many factors that vary by region, including (i) coal quality, which includes energy (heat content), sulfur, ash, volatile matter and moisture content; (ii) differences in market conventions concerning transportation costs and volume measurement; and (iii) regional supply and demand.\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Coal Quality. The energy content or heat value of thermal coal is a significant factor influencing coal prices as higher energy coal is more desirable to consumers and typically commands a higher price in the market. The heat value of coal is commonly measured in British thermal units or the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. Coal from the eastern and midwest regions of the United States tends to have a higher heat value than coal found in the western United States. Coal volatility is a significant factor influencing met coal pricing as coal with a lower volatility has historically been more highly valued and typically commands a higher price in the market. The volatility refers to the loss in mass, less moisture, when coal is heated in the absence of air. The volatility of met coal determines the percentage of feed coal that actually becomes coke, known as coke yield, with lower volatility producing a higher coke yield.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Market Conventions. Coal sales contracts are priced according to conventions specific to the market into which such coal is to be sold. Our domestic sales contracts are typically priced free on board ( FOB\u201d) at our mines and on a short ton basis. Our international sales contracts are typically priced FOB at the shipping port from which such coal is delivered and on a metric ton basis. Accordingly, for international sales contracts, we typically bear the cost of transportation from our mines to the applicable outbound shipping port, and our coal sales realization per ton calculation reflects the conversion of such tonnage from metric tons into short tons, as well as the elimination of the freight and handling fulfillment component of coal sales revenue. In addition, for domestic sales contracts, as customers typically bear the cost of transportation from our mines, our operations located further away from the end user of the coal may command lower prices.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Regional Supply and Demand. Our realized price per ton is influenced by market forces of the regional market into which such coal is to be sold. Market pricing may vary according to region and lead to different discounts or premiums to the most directly comparable benchmark price for such coal product.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Costs. Our results of operations are dependent upon our ability to improve productivity and control costs. Our primary expenses are for operating supply costs, repair and maintenance expenditures, cost of purchased coal, royalties, current wages and benefits, freight and handling costs and taxes incurred in selling our coal. Principal goods and services we use in our operations include maintenance and repair parts and services, electricity, fuel, roof control and support items, explosives, tires, conveyance structure, ventilation supplies and lubricants.\nIn addition, our cost of coal sales includes idle and closed mine costs and purchased coal costs. Additionally due to the Merger, our cost of coal sales includes the cost impact of coal inventory fair value adjustments. In the following table, we calculate adjusted cost of produced coal sold as cost of coal sales less idle and closed mine costs, cost impact of coal inventory fair value adjustments and purchased coal costs.\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

mitigate external cost pressures. We experience volatility in operating costs related to fuel, explosives, steel, tires, contract services and healthcare, among others, and take measures to mitigate the increases in these costs at all operations. We have a centralized sourcing group for major supplier contract negotiation and administration, for the negotiation and purchase of major capital goods, and to support the business units. We promote competition between suppliers and seek to develop relationships with suppliers that focus on lowering our costs. We seek suppliers who identify and concentrate on implementing continuous improvement opportunities within their area of expertise. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. We may also experience difficult geologic conditions, delays in obtaining permits, labor shortages, unforeseen equipment problems, and unexpected shortages of critical materials such as tires, fuel and explosives that may result in adverse cost increases and limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels.\nResults of Operations\nOur results of operations for the Successor period for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are discussed in these Results of Operations\u201d presented below.

See Note 5.\n(2) Does not include $363.1 million of freight and handling fulfillment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nTotal revenues. Total revenues increased $381.2 million, or 23.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. The increase in total revenues was due to increased coal revenues of $265.3 million, increased freight and handling fulfillment revenues of $115.7 million and increased other revenues of $0.2 million.\nCoal revenues. Coal revenues increased $265.3 million, or 19.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. The increase in coal revenues was due primarily to increased revenues of 41.5% and 9.5% for CAPP - Met and our Trading and Logistics operations, respectively, and the addition of revenues from the CAPP - Thermal operations during the current year period, partially offset by decreased revenues of 6.8% for NAPP.\nThe increase in CAPP - Met revenues was primarily due to higher coal sales volume of 1.3 million tons and increases in coal sales realization of $7.30 per ton. CAPP - Thermal revenues consisted of 0.6 million tons sold at a coal sales realization of $56.46 per ton. The decrease in NAPP revenues was primarily due to lower coal sales volumes of 0.6 million tons, partially offset by higher coal sales realization of $1.11 per ton. The increase in Trading and Logistics coal revenues was primarily due to higher sales volumes of 0.6 million tons, partially offset by lower coal sales realization of $4.12 per ton.\nOur sales mix of met coal and thermal coal based on volume was 63.2% and 36.8%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 56.9% and 43.1%, respectively, in the prior year period. Our sales mix of met coal and thermal coal based on coal revenues, excluding freight and handling fulfillment revenues, was 83.2% and 16.8%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 79.4% and 20.6%, respectively, for the prior year period.\nMet coal volumes increased 2.2 million tons due to increased export sales during the current period, and average coal realization per ton decreased $0.05. Thermal coal volumes decreased 0.3 million tons due to increased longwall moves and geological factors during the current period, and average coal realization per ton increased $0.62. The increase in coal revenues consisted of increased met coal revenue of $272.9 million, or 24.7%, partially offset by decreased thermal coal revenue of $7.6 million, or 2.7%.\nFreight and handling fulfillment revenues were $363.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $115.7 million, or 46.8%, compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to increased shipments by rail car and increased shipping rates during the current period.\nOther revenues. Other revenues were $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $0.2 million, or 2.3%, compared to the prior year period, primarily attributable to a $2.0 million increase in coal royalty revenues and a $0.5 million increase in terminal revenues, partially offset by a $2.2 million decrease in rail transportation rebates.\nCosts and Expenses\nTable 188: <table><tr><td>

reportable segments. Coal margin per ton is not shown for our All Other category since it has no coal sales or coal production related to our continuing operations.\nCost of coal sales. Cost of coal sales increased $218.1 million, or 20.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by increased purchases of tons associated with our Trading and Logistics operations segment, increased labor costs, and increased repair and maintenance activities during the current period.\nFreight and handling costs. Freight and handling costs increased $115.7 million, or 46.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to increased shipments by rail car and increased shipping rates during the current period.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $42.6 million, or 122.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. The increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization primarily related to increased purchases of machinery and equipment, increased asset development during the current period, and additions of property, plant and equipment as a result of the Merger.\nAmortization of acquired intangibles, net. Amortization of acquired intangibles, net decreased $64.4 million, or 109.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. The decrease was primarily driven by the write-off of above-market coal sales contract assets during 2017 associated with the sale of PRB, certain other above-market coal sales contract assets being fully amortized as of December 31, 2017, and the amortization related to below-market acquired intangibles acquired as a result of the Merger, partially offset by the accelerated amortization of acquired intangibles related to the above-market coal sales contract asset related to FirstEnergy Generation, LLC during the current period.\nSelling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $8.2 million, or 12.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. This decrease in expense was primarily related to decreases of $7.2 million in stock compensation expense and $5.1 million in professional services fees, partially offset by increases of $3.0 million in incentive bonus plans and $2.5 million in severance pay during the current period.\nMerger related costs. The Merger related costs of $51.8 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 related primarily to professional fees, severance pay and incentive pay incurred related to the Merger Agreement entered into with the Alpha Companies on April 29, 2018.\nSecondary offering costs. The secondary offering costs of $4.5 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to (i) legal fees for drafting the registration statement and other legal services directly related to the withdrawn offering and (ii) financial reporting advisory fees directly related to the withdrawn offering including preparation of the pro forma financial statements and other financial information included in the registration statement.\nAcquisition-related obligations. For the year ended December 31, 2018 the Company recorded a mark-to-market loss on acquisition-related obligations of $24 thousand related to the Contingent Revenue Obligation. The mark-to-market loss on acquisition-related obligations of $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily consisted of a mark-to-market loss of $2.5 million related to the Contingent Reclamation Funding Liability and a mark-to-market loss of $0.7 million related to the Contingent Credit Support Commitment. The gain on settlement of acquisition-related obligations of $38.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily consisted of the UMWA Contingent VEBA Funding Notes 1 and Note 2 settlements.\nOther (income) expense. Other (income) expense decreased $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. This decrease primarily related to the gain on disposal of assets of $16.9 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the sale of a disposal group within the Company's CAPP - Met segment.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased $2.8 million, or 7.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period, primarily due to higher interest costs associated with Company debt as a result of the current year debt refinancing. See Note 15 for additional information.\nLoss on modification and extinguishment of debt. The loss on modification and extinguishment of debt of $12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily related to the write-off of certain outstanding debt discounts, debt issuance costs and debt fees incurred in connection with the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement entered into by the Company on November 9, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017 the Company incurred a loss on modification and extinguishment of debt of $38.7 million, primarily related to a prepayment premium of $22.5 million on the 10.00% Senior Secured First Lien Notes and the write-off of outstanding debt discounts of $13.4 million on the 10.00% Senior Secured First Lien Notes and GUC Distribution Note in connection with the Credit Agreement entered into by the Company on March 17, 2017.\nIncome taxes. Income tax benefit of $165.4 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018 on income from continuing operations before income taxes of $137.5 million. The effective tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the impact of the net operating loss carryback benefit and the reduction in the valuation allowance.\nIncome tax benefit of $68.0 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 on income from continuing operations before income taxes of $105.8 million. The effective tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the impact of the percentage depletion allowance and the reduction in the valuation allowance, partially offset by the revaluation of the net deferred tax assets as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See Note 21 for additional information.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable segments is a financial measure. This non-GAAP financial measure is presented as a supplemental measure and is not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance\nwith GAAP. Moreover, this measure is not calculated identically by all companies and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is presented because management believes it is a useful indicator of the financial performance of our coal operations.

Met segment. From the date we entered into the asset purchase agreement through the transaction close date, the property, plant and equipment and associated asset retirement obligations were classified as held for sale in amounts representing the fair value of the disposal group. Upon permit transfer, the transaction closed on April 2, 2018. We paid $10.0 million in connection with the transaction, which was paid into escrow on March 27, 2018 and transferred to the buyer at the transaction close date, and expect to pay a series of additional cash payments in the aggregate amount of $1.5 million, per the terms stated in the agreement, and recorded a gain on sale of approximately $16.4 million within other (income) expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n(3) The cost impact of the coal inventory fair value adjustment as a result of the Alpha Merger is expected to have short-term impact.\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>CAPP -

Adjusted EBITDA increased $61.4 million, or 35.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by increased average sales realization per ton of $7.30, or approximately 6.2%, due primarily to increases in the market pricing of coal during the current period and increased sales volumes.\nCAPP - Thermal operations. Adjusted EBITDA for the CAAP - Thermal operations was ($0.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The prior year period did not have any activity in this segment and therefore the current year results explain the entire amount of change. The primary driver for adjusted EBITDA during the current year period related to repair and maintenance costs and costs associated with certain idled properties.\nNAPP operations. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $10.1 million, or 18.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to decreased coal margin per ton of $0.89. The decrease in coal margin per ton consisted of increased average cost of coal sales per ton of $2.00, or approximately 5.5%, due primarily to reductions in tons sold due to geological factors during the current period.\nTrading and Logistics operations. Adjusted EBITDA increased $9.4 million, or 10.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to increased sales volumes during the current period and an increase in coal margin per ton of $0.66.\nAll Other category. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $3.3 million, or 8.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period.

The fair value calculation was based on a probability-weighted scenario analysis. The inputs to this analysis included ANR's projected short-term cash flows, which were derived from the ANR financial statements and operating budget provided pursuant to the terms of the agreement. The cash position of ANR at December 31, 2016 increased relative to the projections used at the Acquisition Date resulting in a gain of $17.4 million in the estimated fair value of this obligation. Based on relevant factors including ANR's current cash balance, near-term estimated met coal prices, the September 30, 2018 termination date to loan funds, and the provision that loans can only be requested if ANR's unrestricted cash is below $20.0 million, we adjusted the liability down to $4.6 million for this obligation. Absent a significant change in ANR's cash position and related projections, we do not expect the obligation to change significantly.\nDue to the increase in met coal prices and the corresponding improvement to our financial results, our credit-adjusted risk-free rate as of December 31, 2016 decreased relative to the rate used to discount the Contingent Reclamation Funding Liability at the Acquisition Date. The reduction in the credit-adjusted risk-free rate used to discount the projected obligation was the primary driver of the loss of $6.8 million. Due to the long-term nature of this obligation and the uncertainty of ANR's operational results over the life of the obligation, we maintained the expectations utilized at the Acquisition Date related to ANR's expected long-term contributions to the Restricted Cash Reclamation Accounts.\nInterest expense of $20.5 million for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016 consisted of the accrued interest on debt instruments and acquisition-related obligations, including discounts, resulting from the Acquisition.\nThe mark-to-market loss on the warrant derivative liability of $34.0 million for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016 related to the warrants issued in connection with the Acquisition and was calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The warrants are marked to market at each reporting period with changes in value reflected in earnings. The inputs included in the Black-Scholes pricing model include our stock price, the stated exercise price, the expected term, the annual risk-free interest rate based on the U.S. Constant Maturity Curve and annualized equity volatility. The annualized volatility was calculated by observing volatilities for comparable companies with adjustments for our size and leverage. The annualized volatility as of December 31, 2016 decreased relative to the annualized volatility used as of the Acquisition Date due to the significant improvement in our leverage ratio. However, our stock price as of December 31, 2016 was also significantly higher than our stock price at the Acquisition Date and was the primary driver of the mark-to-market loss of $34.0 million recognized for the warrant derivative liability.\nThe bargain purchase gain of $7.7 million for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016 resulted from the excess of the fair value of the acquired assets over liabilities assumed through the Acquisition.\nIncome tax benefit of $1.9 million was recorded for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016 on loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $13.8 million. The income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the impact of the non-deductible mark-to-market adjustment for the warrant derivative liability, partially offset by the impact of the percentage depletion allowance and the reduction in the valuation allowance. See Note 21 for additional information.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable segments is a non-GAAP financial measure. This non-GAAP financial measure is presented as a supplemental measure and is not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, this measure is not calculated identically by all companies and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is presented because ANR's management believes it is a useful indicator of the financial performance of our coal operations.

Adjusted EBITDA was $0.6 million for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016, driven by coal margin per ton of $0.86, coal sales realization per ton of $60.14 and cost of coal sales per ton of $59.28.\nNAPP operations. Adjusted EBITDA was $35.5 million for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016, driven by coal margin per ton of $7.87, coal sales realization per ton of $43.93 and cost of coal sales per ton of $36.06.\nTrading and Logistics operations. Adjusted EBITDA was ($1.2) million for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016, driven by coal margin per ton of $5.63, coal sales realization per ton of $54.64 and cost of coal sales per ton of $49.01.\nAll Other category. Adjusted EBITDA was ($29.1) million for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016, primarily driven by wages and benefits expense of $8.9 million, incentive pay of $8.1 million, professional fees of $5.8 million, and rent, utilities and property costs of $5.0 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary liquidity and capital resource requirements stem from the cost of our coal production and purchases, our capital expenditures, our debt service, our reclamation obligations, our regulatory costs and settlements and associated costs. Our primary sources of liquidity are derived from sales of coal, our debt financing and miscellaneous revenues.\nWe believe that cash on hand and cash generated from our operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisition-related obligations, and reclamation obligations for the next 12 months. We have relied on a number of assumptions in budgeting for our future activities. These include the costs for mine development to sustain capacity of our operating mines, our cash flows from operations, effects of regulation and taxes by governmental agencies, mining technology improvements and reclamation costs. These assumptions are inherently subject to significant business, political, economic, regulatory, environmental and competitive uncertainties, contingencies and risks, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. We may need to raise additional funds more quickly if market conditions deteriorate, and we may not be able to do so in a timely fashion, or at all; or one or more of our assumptions proves to be incorrect or if we choose to expand our acquisition, exploration, appraisal, or development efforts or any other activity more rapidly than we presently anticipate. We may decide to raise additional funds before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable. We may seek to sell equity or debt securities or obtain\nadditional bank credit facilities. The sale of equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of additional indebtedness could result in increased fixed obligations and additional covenants that could restrict our operations.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had total liquidity of $429.9 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $233.6 million and $196.3 million of unused commitments available under the Amended and Restated Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement, subject to limitations described therein. On November 9, 2018, we entered into a $550.0 million term loan credit facility under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with a maturity date of November 9, 2025, and a $225.0 million asset-based revolving credit facility under the Amended and Restated Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement expiring on April 3, 2022. Refer to Note 15 for disclosures on long-term debt.\nOn November 9, 2018, Contura, along with the Alpha Companies, completed the Merger in which the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding Class C-1 shares of ANR and the 100% of the outstanding shares of Holdings. Prior to the closing of the transaction, the Alpha Companies stockholders also received a special cash dividend (the Dividend\u201d). Refer to Note 3 for additional disclosures surrounding these amounts. Additionally, on November 6, 2018, Contura, the Alpha Companies and the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (the WVDEP\u201d) entered into a binding term sheet agreement to resolve certain issues related to the issuance of the Dividend under the Permitting and Reclamation Plan Settlement Agreement for the State of West Virginia dated as of July 12, 2016. The agreement, among other things, required the posting of collateral to secure Contura's and ANR's payment obligations under the Amended Reclamation Funding Agreement and the Amended Settlement Agreement until a performance bond was issued as described in the following sentence. The performance bond was issued during the fourth quarter of 2018. Refer to Note 26 for disclosures surrounding the WVDEP Settlement Agreement.\nWe sponsor three qualified non-contributory pension plans ( Pension Plans\u201d) which cover certain salaried and non-union hourly employees. Participants accrued benefits either based on certain formulas, the participant's compensation prior to retirement or plan specified amounts for each year of service. Benefits are frozen under these Pension Plans. Annual funding contributions to the Pension Plans are made as recommended by consulting actuaries based upon the ERISA funding standards. Funding decisions also consider certain funded status thresholds defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. We expect to contribute $6.4 million to the Pension Plans in 2019. See Note 22 for further disclosures related to this obligation.\nTo secure our obligations under certain worker's compensation, black lung, reclamation-related obligations, general liabilities, and financial guarantees, we are required to provide cash collateral. At December 31, 2018, we had cash collateral in the amounts of $243.6 million, $24.0 million, and $29.1 million classified as short-term and long-term restricted cash, short-term and long-term deposits, and long-term restricted investments, respectively, on our balance sheet. Once the permits associated with the PRB transaction have been transferred, we estimate approximately $12.6 million, comprised of short-term restricted cash and short-term deposits, will be returned to operating cash. If the permit transfer process is not completed as expected, it could have material, adverse effects on us.\nCash Flows\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased by $283.3 million, $22.7 million, $171.3 million, and $16.2 million over the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016, and the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016, respectively.

financing related to the Merger.\nAnalysis of Material Debt Covenants\nWe were in compliance with all covenants under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and the Amended and Restated Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement, as of April 1, 2019. A breach of the covenants in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and the Amended and Restated Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement could result in a default under the terms of the agreement and the respective lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed due and payable.\nPursuant to the Amended and Restated Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement, during any Liquidity Period (capitalized terms as defined in the Amended and Restated Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement), our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio cannot be less than 1.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of any Test Period, commencing with the Test Period ended immediately preceding the commencement of such Liquidity Period. The Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is calculated as (a) Consolidated EBITDA of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries for such period, minus non-financed Capital Expenditures (including Capital Expenditures financed with the proceeds of any Loans) paid or payable currently in cash by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for such period to (b) the Fixed Charges of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries during such period. As of April 1, 2019, we were not in a Liquidity Period.\nIn the event that there shall be Excess Cash Flow for any fiscal quarter commencing with the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2019, pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we will, no later than 70 days after the end of such fiscal quarter (or 130 days in the case of the last fiscal quarter of any fiscal year), prepay the loan amounts under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, based on the Total Leverage Ratio as follows:\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Leverage Ratio (1)\n</td> <td>Prepayment Amount (2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equal to or greater than 2.25\n</td> <td>75% of Excess Cash Flow\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less than 2.25 and greater than or equal to 1.00\n</td> <td>50% of Excess Cash Flow\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less than 1.00\n</td> <td>25% of Excess Cash Flow\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Total Leverage Ratio is calculated as the ratio of (i) Consolidated Net Total Debt on such date to (ii) Consolidated EBITDA (capitalized terms as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) for the period of the four consecutive fiscal quarters ending as of the date of the financial statements most recently delivered.\n(2) % of Excess Cash Flow is reduced by voluntary repayments of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as defined within the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nExcess Cash Flow is calculated in accordance with our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and is equal to (i) the sum, without duplication, of Consolidated Net Income, the aggregate amount of all non-cash charges, the amount of the decrease, if any, in Consolidated Working Capital and the amount of non-cash losses on the disposition of property to the extent deducted in arriving at Consolidated Net Income minus (ii) the sum, without duplication, of the amount of all non-cash credits included in arriving at Consolidated Net Income, certain capital expenditures, certain amounts of regularly scheduled principal payments of Indebtedness made in cash, the amount of the increase, if any, in Consolidated Working Capital and the aggregate amount of non-cash gains on the disposition of property to the extent included in arriving at Consolidated Net Income.\nConsolidated Net Income is calculated in accordance with our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and is equal to the net income determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding, without duplication, noncash compensation expenses related to common stock and other equity securities issued to employees, extraordinary and non-recurring gains and loss, income or losses from discontinued operations or disposal of discontinued operations or costs and expense associated with the closure of any minds (including any reclamation or disposal obligations), any non-cash impairment charges or asset write-offs resulting from the application of certain ASC standards, net unrealized gains or losses resulting from non-cash foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses, net unrealized gains or losses results in such period from certain derivatives, non-cash charges including non-cash charges due to cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles, any net income or loss of any person that is not a restricted subsidiary or that is accounted for by equity method accounting except to the extent the dividends or similar distributions are paid in cash to the specified person or restricted subsidiary, the net income (but not loss) of any restricted subsidiary to the extent that the declaration or payment of dividends or similar distributions by that restricted subsidiary of that net income is not at the date of determination permitted without any prior governmental approval (that has not been obtained) or, directly or indirectly, by operation of the terms of its charter or any agreement, instrument, judgment, decree, order, statute, rule or governmental regulation applicable to that restricted subsidiary or its stockholders (other than any restriction that has been waived or released), plus, without duplication, any cash dividends and/or distributions actually received by the Company or restricted subsidiary from any unrestricted subsidiary and/or joint venture to the extent not already included therein.\nAdditionally, under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, our ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional indebtedness, making investments and paying dividends is also tied to certain financial ratios, including Consolidated EBITDA as defined per the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Consolidated EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash items, non-recurring items, and other adjustments permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. EBITDA, a measure used by management to evaluate our ongoing operations for internal planning and forecasting purposes, is defined as net income (loss) from operations plus interest expense, income tax expense, amortization of acquired intangibles, net and depreciation, depletion and amortization, less interest income and income tax benefit. EBITDA is not a financial measure recognized under United States generally accepted accounting principles and does not purport to be an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. The amounts shown for EBITDA as presented may differ from amounts calculated and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nConsolidated EBITDA is calculated in accordance with our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and is equal to Consolidated Net Income plus, without duplication (i) consolidated interest expense; (ii) to the extent deducted in computing such Consolidated Net Income, the sum of all income, franchise or similar taxes; (iii) depreciation, depletion, amortization (including, without limitation, amortization of intangibles, deferred financing fees and any amortization included in pension or other employee benefit expenses) and all other non-cash items reducing Consolidated Net Income (including, without limitation, write-downs and impairment of property, plant, equipment and intangibles and other long-lived assets and the impact of acquisition accounting, but excluding, in each case, non-cash charges in a period which reflect cash expenses paid or to be paid in another period); (iv) non-recurring restructuring costs, expenses and charges, including, without limitation, all business optimization costs and expenses, facility opening, pre-opening and closing and consolidation costs and expenses, advisory and professional fees and stay and retention bonuses; provided that the amount of non-recurring restructuring costs, expenses and\ncharges permitted to be added back pursuant to this clause (iv) for a four-quarter period shall not exceed 20% of Consolidated EBITDA for such period (calculated before giving effect to such add-back); (v) any expenses, costs or charges related to any equity offering, Investment permitted, acquisition, disposition, recapitalization or Indebtedness permitted to be incurred by the indenture (whether or not successful); (vi) all non-recurring or unusual losses, charges and expenses (and less all non-recurring or unusual gains); (vii) all non-cash charges and expenses; (viii) any debt extinguishment costs; (ix) any amount of asset retirement obligations expenses; (x) all Transaction Costs incurred in connection with the Transactions contemplated hereby; (xi) transaction costs, fees and expenses incurred during such period in connection with any acquisition or disposition not prohibited hereunder or any issuance of debt or equity securities by the surviving Parent, the Borrowers or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case, for such expenses; and (xii) commissions, premiums, discounts, fees or other charges relating to performance bonds, bid bonds, appeal bonds, surety bonds, wage bonds, bonds issued in favor of any Governmental Authority, reclamation and completion guarantees and other similar obligations; provided that, with respect to any Restricted Subsidiary, such items will be added only to the extent and in the same proportion that the relevant Restricted Subsidiary's net income was included in calculating Consolidated Net Income.\nThe calculation of Consolidated EBITDA is based on our results of operations in accordance with the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and therefore, is different from Adjusted EBITDA presented elsewhere in this report. The calculation of Consolidated EBITDA for purposes of the Excess Cash Flow calculation is performed at the end of each fiscal quarter (commencing with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2019).\nAcquisition-Related Obligations\nSee Note 16 for additional details and disclosures on acquisition-related obligations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, operating leases, indemnifications and financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds. Obligations related to these arrangements are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. However, the underlying liabilities that they secure, such as asset retirement obligations, workers' compensation liabilities, and royalty obligations, are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nWe are required to provide financial assurance in order to perform the post-mining reclamation required by our mining permits, pay our federal production royalties, pay workers' compensation claims under workers' compensation laws in various states, pay federal black lung benefits, and perform certain other obligations. In order to provide the required financial assurance, we generally use surety bonds for post-mining reclamation and workers' compensation obligations. We can also use bank letters of credit to collateralize certain obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding surety bonds with a total face amount of $581.4 million to secure various obligations and commitments, including $237.2 million related to the PRB. To secure our reclamation-related obligations, we currently have $137.3 million of collateral supporting these obligations. Once the permits associated with the PRB Transaction have been transferred, the Company estimates approximately $12.6 million comprised of short-term restricted cash and short-term deposits will be returned to operating cash.\nTo secure our obligations under certain worker's compensation, black lung, reclamation-related obligations, general liabilities, and financial guarantees, we are required to provide cash collateral. At December 31, 2018, we had cash collateral in the amounts of $243.6 million, $24.0 million, and $29.1 million classified as short-term and long-term restricted cash, short-term and long-term deposits, and long-term restricted investments, respectively, on our balance sheet.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had real property collateralizing $26.7 million of reclamation bonds.\nWe meet frequently with our surety providers and have discussions with certain providers regarding the extent of and the terms of their participation in the program. These discussions may cause us to shift surety bonds between providers or to alter the terms of their participation in our program. To the extent that surety bonds become unavailable or our surety bond providers require additional collateral, we would seek to secure our obligations with letters of credit, cash deposits or other suitable forms of collateral. Our failure to maintain, or inability to acquire, surety bonds or to provide a suitable alternative would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. These failures could result from a variety of factors including lack of availability, higher cost or unfavorable market terms of new surety bonds, and the exercise by third-party surety bond issuers of their right to refuse to renew the surety.\nOther\nAs a regular part of our business, we review opportunities for, and engage in discussions and negotiations concerning, the acquisition or disposition of coal mining and related infrastructure assets and interests in coal mining companies, and acquisitions or dispositions of, or combinations or other strategic transactions involving companies with coal mining or other energy assets. When we believe that these opportunities are consistent with our strategic plans and our acquisition or disposition criteria, we will make bids or proposals and/or enter into letters of intent and other similar agreements. These bids or proposals, which may be binding or non-binding, are customarily subject to a variety of conditions and usually permit us to terminate the discussions and any related agreement if, among other things, we are not satisfied with the results of due diligence. Any acquisition opportunities we pursue could materially affect our liquidity and capital resources and may require us to incur indebtedness, seek equity capital or both. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>412,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>624,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other debt (2)\n</td> <td>2,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition-related obligations\n</td> <td>17,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contingent revenue obligation (3)\n</td> <td>9,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment purchase commitments (4)\n</td> <td>24,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transportation commitments\n</td> <td>3,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>3,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum royalties\n</td> <td>13,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Coal purchase commitments (5)\n</td> <td>260,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>260,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>381,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>441,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,138,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes Term Loan Credit Facility principal amounts of $27.5 million in 2019, $27.5 million in 2020, $27.5 million in 2021, $27.5 million in 2022, $27.5 million in 2023, and $412.5 million after 2023.

See Note 22 for further disclosures related to this obligation.\nWe expect to spend between $170 million and $190 million on capital expenditures during 2019.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions, including the current economic environment that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and adjust such estimates and assumptions as facts and circumstances require. Foreign currency and energy markets, and fluctuations in demand for steel products have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in these estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.\nBusiness Combinations. We account for our business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying identifiable net tangible and intangible assets based on their respective estimated fair values. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment, the utilization of independent valuation experts and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, market prices and asset lives, among other items.\nReclamation. Our asset retirement obligations arise from the federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 and similar state statutes, which require that mine property be restored in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan. Significant reclamation activities include reclaiming refuse and slurry ponds, reclaiming the pit and support acreage at surface mines, sealing portals at deep mines and the treatment of water. We determine the future cash flows necessary to satisfy our reclamation obligations on a permit-by-permit basis based upon current permit requirements and various estimates and assumptions, including estimates of disturbed acreage, cost estimates, and assumptions regarding productivity. We are also faced with increasingly stringent environmental regulation, much of which is beyond our control, which could increase our costs and materially increase our asset retirement obligations. Estimates of disturbed acreage are determined based on approved mining plans and related engineering data. Cost estimates are based upon third-party costs. Productivity assumptions are based on historical experience with the equipment that is expected to be utilized in the reclamation activities. Our asset retirement obligations are initially recorded at fair value. In order to determine fair value, we use assumptions including a discount rate and third-party margin. Each is discussed further below:\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Discount Rate. Asset retirement obligations are initially recorded at fair value. We utilize discounted cash flow techniques to estimate the fair value of our obligations. We base our discount rate on the rates of treasury bonds with maturities similar to expected mine lives and adjust for our credit standing as necessary after considering funding and assurance provisions. Changes in our credit standing could have a material impact on our asset retirement obligations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Third-Party Margin. The measurement of an obligation at fair value is based upon the amount a third-party would demand to perform the obligation. Because we plan to perform a significant amount of the reclamation activities with internal resources, a third-party margin was added to the estimated costs of these activities. This margin was estimated based upon our historical experience with contractors performing similar types of reclamation activities. The inclusion of this margin will result in a recorded obligation that is greater than our estimates of our cost to perform the reclamation activities. If our cost estimates are accurate, the excess of the recorded obligation over the cost incurred to perform the work will be recorded within depreciation, depletion and amortization within our Consolidated Statements of Operations at the time that reclamation work is completed.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> On at least an annual basis, we review our reclamation liabilities and make necessary adjustments for permit changes as granted by state authorities, additional costs resulting from accelerated mine closures, and revisions to cost estimates and productivity assumptions, to reflect current experience and updated plans. At December 31, 2018, we had recorded asset retirement obligation liabilities of $228.4 million, including amounts reported as current, and $1.4 million asset retirement obligations liabilities classified as held for sale. While the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with certainty, as of December 31, 2018, we estimate that the aggregate undiscounted cost of final mine closures is approximately $619.2 million.\nRetirement Plans. We have three non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans (the Pension Plans\u201d) covering certain of our salaried and non-union hourly employees, all of which are frozen. Benefits are based on either the employee's compensation prior to retirement or stated amounts for each year of service with us. Funding of the Pension Plans is in accordance with requirements of ERISA, and our contributions can be deducted for federal income tax purposes. We contributed $0 to our Pension Plans for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a net periodic benefit credit of $0.3 million for our Pension Plans and have recorded net obligations of $180.8 million.\nThe calculation of the net periodic benefit expense/credit and projected benefit obligation associated with our Pension Plans requires the use of a number of assumptions, which are used by our independent actuaries to make the underlying calculations. Changes in these assumptions can result in different net periodic benefit expense and liability amounts, and actual experience can differ from the assumptions.\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is an assumption of the rate of return on plan assets reflecting the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. We establish the expected long-term rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon historical returns and projected returns on the underlying mix of invested assets. The Pension Plans investment targets are 40% equity securities and 60% debt securities. Investments are rebalanced on a periodic basis to stay within these targeted guidelines. The long-term rate of return assumption used to determine net periodic benefit expense was 5.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The long-term rate of return assumption to be used in 2019 is expected to be 5.8%. Any difference between the actual experience and the assumed experience is deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss and amortized into expense in future periods.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The discount rate represents our estimate of the interest rate at which pension benefits could be effectively settled. Assumed discount rates are used in the measurement of the projected and accumulated benefit obligations and the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense. In estimating that rate, we use rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments. The weighted average discount rate used to determine pension expense was 4.23% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The differences resulting from actual versus assumed discount rates are amortized into pension expense/credit over the remaining average life of the active plan participants. A one percentage-point increase in the discount rate would increase the net periodic pension cost for the year ended December 31, 2018 by approximately $1.9 million and decrease the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2018 by approximately $88.0 million. The corresponding effects of a one percentage-point decrease in discount rate would decrease the net periodic pension cost for the year ended December 31, 2018 by approximately $2.9 million and increase the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2018 by approximately $111.6 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Coal Workers' Pneumoconiosis. We are required by federal and state statues to provide benefits to employees for awards related to coal workers' pneumoconiosis disease (black lung). Certain of our subsidiaries are insured for black lung obligations by a third-party insurance provider. Certain subsidiaries in West Virginia are self-insured for state black lung obligations. Certain other subsidiaries are self-insured for black lung benefits and may fund benefit payments through Section 501(c)(21) tax-exempt trust fund. Provisions are made for estimated benefits based on annual evaluations prepared by independent actuaries. Charges are made to operations for self-insured black lung claims, as determined by an independent actuary at the present value of the actuarially computed liability for such benefits over the employee's applicable term of service. These actuarially determined liabilities use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate, future cost trends, demographic\nassumptions and return on plan assets to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could affect our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. As of December 31, 2018, we had estimated black lung obligations of approximately $92.2 million, including amounts reported as current and $94 thousand related to discontinued operations, which are net of assets of $2.6 million that are held in a tax-exempt trust fund.\nIncome Taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction in which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including the expected reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, taxable income available via carryback to prior years, tax planning strategies, and results of recent operations. We assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets, including scheduling the reversal of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, to determine the amount of valuation allowance needed. Scheduling the reversal of deferred tax asset and liability balances requires judgment and estimation. We believe the deferred tax liabilities relied upon as future taxable income in our assessment will reverse in the same period and jurisdiction and are of the same character as the temporary differences giving rise to the deferred tax assets that will be realized. At December 31, 2018, a valuation allowance of $94.8 million has been provided on federal and state net operating losses and gross deferred tax assets not expected to provide future tax benefits.\nAsset Impairment. U.S. GAAP requires that a long-lived asset group that is held and used should be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset group might not be recoverable. Testing long-lived assets for impairment after indicators of impairment have been identified is a two-step process. Step one compares the net undiscounted cash flows of an asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value of an asset group exceeds the net undiscounted cash flows of that asset group, step two is performed whereby the fair value of the asset group is estimated and compared to its carrying amount. The amount of impairment, if any, is equal to the excess of the carrying value of an asset group over its estimated fair value. The amount of impairment, if any, is allocated to the long-lived assets on a pro-rata basis, except that the carrying value of the individual long-lived assets are not reduced below their estimated fair value. Long-lived assets located in a close geographic area are grouped together for purposes of impairment testing when, after considering revenue and cost interdependencies, circumstances indicate the assets are used together to produce future cash flows. Our asset groups generally consist of the assets and applicable liabilities of one or more mines and preparation plants and associated coal reserves for which cash flows are largely independent of cash flows of other mines, preparation plants and associated reserves.\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of acquired companies. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is tested for impairment annually as of October 31 of each year, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist.\nIn order to test for goodwill impairment, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. However, the loss recognized for any given reporting unit cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the testing discussed above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further assessment.\nThe valuation methodology utilized to estimate the fair value of the reporting units is based on both a market and income approach and is within the range of fair values yielded under each approach. The income approach is based on a discounted cash flow methodology in which expected future net cash flows are discounted to present value, using an appropriate after-tax weighted average cost of capital (discount rate). The market approach is based on a guideline company and similar transaction methodology. Under the guideline company approach, certain metrics from a selected group of publicly traded guideline companies that have similar operations to the Company's reporting units are used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units. Under the similar transactions approach, recent merger and acquisition transactions for companies that have similar operations to the Company's reporting units are used to estimate the fair value of the Company's reporting units.\nThe income approach is dependent upon a number of significant management estimates about future performance including sales volumes and prices, costs to produce, income taxes, capital spending, working capital changes and the after-tax weighted average cost of capital. Changes in any of these assumptions could materially impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units. Our forecasts of coal prices generally reflect a long-term outlook of market prices expected to be received for\nour coal. However, coal prices are influenced by global market conditions beyond our control. If actual coal prices are less than our expectations, it could have a material impact on the fair value of our reporting units. Our forecasts of costs to produce coal are based on our operating forecasts and an assumed inflation rate for materials and supplies such as steel, diesel fuel and explosives. However, the costs of the materials and supplies used in our production process such as steel, diesel fuel and explosives are influenced by global market conditions beyond our control. If actual costs are higher or if inflation increases above our expectations, it could have a material impact on the fair value of our reporting units. We also are faced with increasingly stringent safety standards and governmental regulation, much of which is beyond our control, which could increase our costs and materially decrease the fair value of our reporting units. For a further discussion of the factors that could result in a change in our assumptions, see Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nContingent Revenue Obligation. Our contingent revenue obligation was assumed in connection with the Merger. Determining the fair value of this obligation requires management's judgment and the utilization of independent valuation experts, and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to forecasts of future revenues, revenue volatility, and discount rates. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual payments made under the obligation could differ materially from our current estimates. For a further discussion of the factors that could result in a change in our assumptions, see Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements.

The warrants are marked to market at each reporting period with changes in value reflected in earnings. The inputs included in the Black-Scholes pricing model include our stock price, the stated exercise price, the expected term, the annual risk-free interest rate based on the U.S. Constant Maturity Curve and annualized equity volatility. The annualized volatility was calculated by observing volatilities for comparable companies with adjustments for our size and leverage. The annualized volatility as of December 31, 2016 decreased relative to the annualized volatility used as of the Acquisition Date due to the significant improvement in our leverage ratio. However, our stock price as of December 31, 2016 was also significantly higher than our stock price at the Acquisition Date and was the primary driver of the mark-to-market loss of $34.0 million recognized for the warrant derivative liability.\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Coal margin per ton (2):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CAPP - Met operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32.59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CAPP - Thermal operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NAPP operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trading and Logistics operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26.84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements.

Consolidated EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash items, non-recurring items, and other adjustments permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.

If the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. However, the loss recognized for any given reporting unit cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the testing discussed above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further assessment.\nDue to the increase in met coal prices and the corresponding improvement to our financial results, our credit-adjusted risk-free rate as of December 31, 2016 decreased relative to the rate used to discount the Contingent Reclamation Funding Liability at the Acquisition Date. The reduction in the credit-adjusted risk-free rate used to discount the projected obligation was the primary driver of the loss of $6.8 million. Due to the long-term nature of this obligation and the uncertainty of ANR's operational results over the life of the obligation, we maintained the expectations utilized at the Acquisition Date related to ANR's expected long-term contributions to the Restricted Cash Reclamation Accounts.\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except for per ton data)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ or Tons\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Coal revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Met\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,378,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,105,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>272,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thermal\n</td> <td>279,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>286,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,648\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Freight and handling fulfillment revenues (1)\n</td> <td>363,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>247,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>10,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,031,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,649,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>381,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tons sold:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Met\n</td> <td>11,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thermal\n</td> <td>6,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(275\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>17,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Coal sales realization per ton (2):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Met\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>123.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124.03\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.05\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thermal\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88.94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have four reportable segments: CAPP - Met, CAPP - Thermal, NAPP, and Trading and Logistics. See Note 28 for more information about our reportable segments. CAPP - Met consists of twenty-five active mines, including four mines in Virginia operated by third-party contractors, four mines operated by us in Virginia, and seventeen mines operated by us in West Virginia. CAPP - Met operations also include two preparation plants in Virginia, six preparation plants in West Virginia, as well as expenses associated with certain idled and closed mines. The coal produced by the CAPP - Met segment is predominantly met coal with some amounts of thermal coal being produced as a byproduct of mining. CAPP - Thermal consists of six active mines and three preparation plants in West Virginia, as well as expenses associated with certain idle and closed mines. The coal produced by the CAPP - Thermal segment is predominantly thermal coal with some met coal byproduct. NAPP consists of one active mine in Pennsylvania and one preparation plant, as well as expenses associated with one closed mine. Our NAPP segment produces primarily thermal coal, however, we are also able to sell part of our Cumberland coal production (0.7 and 0.2 million tons for the years ended 2018 and 2017, respectively) into the met coal market as High-Vol. B, achieving higher realized pricing than if sold as thermal coal. The Trading and Logistics segment focuses primarily on coal trading and coal terminal facility services. Our All Other category includes general corporate overhead and corporate assets and liabilities and the elimination of certain intercompany activity.\nFinancing Activities\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>CAPP - Met\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CAPP - Thermal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NAPP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Trading and Logistics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>All Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Combined\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(26,407\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(43,143\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,452\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(61,541\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(39,881\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(39,881\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, depletion and amortization\n</td> <td>15,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash stock compensation expense\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>593\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reorganization items, net\n</td> <td>8,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairment and restructuring\n</td> <td>1,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accretion on asset retirement obligations\n</td> <td>1,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of acquired intangibles, net\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA (1) (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,180\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(29,073\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Total Leverage Ratio is calculated as the ratio of (i) Consolidated Net Total Debt on such date to (ii) Consolidated EBITDA (capitalized terms as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) for the period of the four consecutive fiscal quarters ending as of the date of the financial statements most recently delivered.\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Leverage Ratio (1)\n</td> <td>Prepayment Amount (2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equal to or greater than 2.25\n</td> <td>75% of Excess Cash Flow\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less than 2.25 and greater than or equal to 1.00\n</td> <td>50% of Excess Cash Flow\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less than 1.00\n</td> <td>25% of Excess Cash Flow\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 Market Conventions. Coal sales contracts are priced according to conventions specific to the market into which such coal is to be sold. Our domestic sales contracts are typically priced free on board ( FOB\u201d) at our mines and on a short ton basis. Our international sales contracts are typically priced FOB at the shipping port from which such coal is delivered and on a metric ton basis. Accordingly, for international sales contracts, we typically bear the cost of transportation from our mines to the applicable outbound shipping port, and our coal sales realization per ton calculation reflects the conversion of such tonnage from metric tons into short tons, as well as the elimination of the freight and handling fulfillment component of coal sales revenue. In addition, for domestic sales contracts, as customers typically bear the cost of transportation from our mines, our operations located further away from the end user of the coal may command lower prices. \nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except for per ton data)\n</td> <td>Period from\nJanuary 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total Revenues\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Coal revenues (1):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CAPP - Met operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CAPP - Thermal operations\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NAPP operations\n</td> <td>204,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trading and Logistics operations\n</td> <td>8,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total coal revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>344,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tons sold:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CAPP - Met operations\n</td> <td>2,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CAPP - Thermal operations\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NAPP operations\n</td> <td>4,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trading and Logistics operations\n</td> <td>157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Coal sales realization per ton (1):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CAPP - Met operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CAPP - Thermal operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NAPP operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43.93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trading and Logistics operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54.64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The cost impact of the coal inventory fair value adjustment as a result of the Alpha Merger is expected to have short-term impact.\nOverview\nGoodwill.

We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions, including the current economic environment that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and adjust such estimates and assumptions as facts and circumstances require. Foreign currency and energy markets, and fluctuations in demand for steel products have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in these estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Coal margin per ton (2):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CAPP -

The change in our operating assets and liabilities of $46.6 million was primarily attributed to decreases in trade accounts receivable of $42.8 million and decreases in inventories, net of $16.7 million, partially offset by decreases in other non-current liabilities of $15.6 million.\nOn December 8, 2017, we closed a transaction with Blackjewel L.L.C. ( Buyer\u201d) to sell the Eagle Butte and Belle Ayr mines located in the Power River Basin ( PRB\u201d). During the permit transfer period, we will maintain the required reclamation bonds and related collateral. As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding surety bonds with a total face amount of $237.2 million to secure various obligations and commitments related to the PRB. A citizens' organization filed objections to the permit transfer with the Wyoming Environmental Quality Council on November 16, 2018. The objections are scheduled to be heard on May 15 and 16, 2019. We believe the objections are without merit. Once the permits have been transferred, we estimate approximately $12.6 million comprised of short-term restricted cash and short-term deposits will be returned to operating cash. If the permit transfer process is not completed as expected, it could have material, adverse effects on us.\nof met coal from our Trading and Logistics business, and 6.7 million tons of thermal coal from CAPP - Met and NAPP. During the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016, we sold 1.6 million tons of met coal from CAPP - Met and NAPP, 1.5 million tons of met coal from our Trading and Logistics business, and 2.7 million tons of thermal coal from CAPP - Met and NAPP. During the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016, we sold 2.4 million tons of met coal from CAPP - Met and NAPP, 0.2 million tons of met coal from our Trading and Logistics business, and 4.4 million tons of thermal coal from CAPP - Met and NAPP.\nThe following tables summarize certain financial information relating to our operating results that have been derived from our consolidated financial statements for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016. Also included is certain information relating to the operating results as a percentage of total revenues.\nAsset impairment and restructuring expenses of $3.1 million for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016 consisted of $2.1 million of losses related to non-core property divestitures and $1.0 million related to severance expenses and other restructuring-related charges.\nPer terms of the Back-to-Back Coal Supply Agreements, we are required to purchase and sell coal in 2019 and 2020 totaling $16.1 million and $9.2 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we purchased and sold 5.7 million tons, totaling $62.1 million, under the Back-to-Back Coal Supply Agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we purchased and sold 2.0 million tons, totaling $21.7 million, under the Back-to-Back Coal Supply Agreements.\nThe discussion below contains non-GAAP financial measures.\u201d These are financial measures which either exclude or include amounts that are not excluded or included in the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). Specifically, we make use of the non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted EBITDA\u201d and Adjusted Cost of Produced Coal Sold.\u201d Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to be an alternative to net income (loss) as a measure of operating performance. The presentation of these measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.\nThe income approach is dependent upon a number of significant management estimates about future performance including sales volumes and prices, costs to produce, income taxes, capital spending, working capital changes and the after-tax weighted average cost of capital. Changes in any of these assumptions could materially impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units. Our forecasts of coal prices generally reflect a long-term outlook of market prices expected to be received for\nRevenues \nBusiness Developments\nResults of Operations\nThe major components of cash flows related to our discontinued operations are as follows:\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016 was $21.5 million and was primarily attributed to net loss of $10.9 million adjusted for depreciation, depletion and amortization of $44.0 million, amortization of acquired intangibles, net of $61.3 million, and mark-to-market adjustment for warrants derivative liability of $34.0 million, partially offset by a gain on mark-to-market adjustment for acquisition-related obligations of $10.6 million. The change in our operating assets and liabilities of ($111.5) million was primarily attributed to increases in trade accounts receivable of $114.2 million, increases in inventories, net of $32.0 million and increases in deposits of $55.4 million, partially offset by increases in trade accounts payable of $59.2 million and increases in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $51.1 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $158.4 million and was primarily attributable to net income of $299.2 million adjusted for depreciation, depletion and amortization of $77.5 million, employee benefit plans, net of $9.2 million, accretion on asset retirement obligations of $10.0 million, loss on modification and extinguishment of debt of $12.0 million and stock-based compensation of $13.4 million, partially offset by a $16.9 million gain on disposal of assets and changes in deferred income taxes of $66.7 million. The change in our operating assets and liabilities of ($191.3) million was primarily attributed to increases in trade accounts receivable of $84.1 million, increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $44.3 million, increases in other non-current assets of $36.7 million, decreases in acquisition-related obligations of $14.5 million, and decreases in other non-current liabilities of $19.9 million, partially offset by decreases in inventories, net of $33.2 million.\nSales Agreements\nPeriod from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016 (Predecessor)\nTo secure our obligations under certain worker's compensation, black lung, reclamation-related obligations, general liabilities, and financial guarantees, we are required to provide cash collateral. At December 31, 2018, we had cash collateral in the amounts of $243.6 million, $24.0 million, and $29.1 million classified as short-term and long-term restricted cash, short-term and long-term deposits, and long-term restricted investments, respectively, on our balance sheet.\n(1) Coal margin per ton is calculated as coal sales realization per ton less cost of coal sales per ton.\nAsset Impairment. U.S. GAAP requires that a long-lived asset group that is held and used should be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset group might not be recoverable. Testing long-lived assets for impairment after indicators of impairment have been identified is a two-step process. Step one compares the net undiscounted cash flows of an asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value of an asset group exceeds the net undiscounted cash flows of that asset group, step two is performed whereby the fair value of the asset group is estimated and compared to its carrying amount. The amount of impairment, if any, is equal to the excess of the carrying value of an asset group over its estimated fair value. The amount of impairment, if any, is allocated to the long-lived assets on a pro-rata basis, except that the carrying value of the individual long-lived assets are not reduced below their estimated fair value. Long-lived assets located in a close geographic area are grouped together for purposes of impairment testing when, after considering revenue and cost interdependencies, circumstances indicate the assets are used together to produce future cash flows. Our asset groups generally consist of the assets and applicable liabilities of one or more mines and preparation plants and associated coal reserves for which cash flows are largely independent of cash flows of other mines, preparation plants and associated reserves.\nThe valuation methodology utilized to estimate the fair value of the reporting units is based on both a market and income approach and is within the range of fair values yielded under each approach. The income approach is based on a discounted cash flow methodology in which expected future net cash flows are discounted to present value, using an appropriate after-tax weighted average cost of capital (discount rate). The market approach is based on a guideline company and similar transaction methodology. Under the guideline company approach, certain metrics from a selected group of publicly traded guideline companies that have similar operations to the Company's reporting units are used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units. Under the similar transactions approach, recent merger and acquisition transactions for companies that have similar operations to the Company's reporting units are used to estimate the fair value of the Company's reporting units.\n(5) Includes an estimated $70.9 million in 2019 related to contractually committed variable priced tons from vendors with historical performance resulting in less than 20% of the committed tonnage being delivered.\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016 was $108.4 million, primarily driven by cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash acquired in the Acquisition of $143.8 million partially offset by capital expenditures of $34.5 million and capital contributions to equity affiliates of $2.7 million.\nTrading and Logistics operations. Adjusted EBITDA was $39.3 million for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016, driven by coal margin per ton of $26.84, coal sales realization per ton of $106.96 and cost of coal sales per ton of $80.12.\nCost of coal sales was $305.3 million, freight and handling costs were $52.1 million, other expenses were $2.2 million, depreciation, depletion and amortization was $66.1 million, accretion on asset retirement obligations was $5.0 million, amortization of acquired intangibles, net was $11.6 million and selling, general and administrative expenses were $29.6 million for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016.\nCash Flows\nReorganization items, net of $21.0 million for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016 primarily consisted of realized gains and losses from the settlement of pre-petition liabilities, professional fees, and provisions for losses resulting from Predecessor Alpha's Restructuring.\nOur primary liquidity and capital resource requirements stem from the cost of our coal production and purchases, our capital expenditures, our debt service, our reclamation obligations, our regulatory costs and settlements and associated costs. Our primary sources of liquidity are derived from sales of coal, our debt financing and miscellaneous revenues.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nContractual Obligations\nWe expect to spend between $170 million and $190 million on capital expenditures during 2019.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable segments is a non-GAAP financial measure. This non-GAAP financial measure is presented as a supplemental measure and is not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, this measure is not calculated identically by all companies and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is presented because ANR's management believes it is a useful indicator of the financial performance of our coal operations. The following table presents a reconciliation of net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016:\nUpon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, our common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker CTRA.\u201d Previously, our shares traded on the OTC market under the ticker CNTE.\u201d\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n (2) Coal margin per ton for our reportable segments is calculated as coal sales realization per ton for our reportable segments less cost of coal sales per ton for our reportable segments. Coal margin per ton is not shown for our All Other category since it has no coal sales or coal production related to our continuing operations. \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\n\nExcess Cash Flow is calculated in accordance with our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and is equal to (i) the sum, without duplication, of Consolidated Net Income, the aggregate amount of all non-cash charges, the amount of the decrease, if any, in Consolidated Working Capital and the amount of non-cash losses on the disposition of property to the extent deducted in arriving at Consolidated Net Income minus (ii) the sum, without duplication, of the amount of all non-cash credits included in arriving at Consolidated Net Income, certain capital expenditures, certain amounts of regularly scheduled principal payments of Indebtedness made in cash, the amount of the increase, if any, in Consolidated Working Capital and the aggregate amount of non-cash gains on the disposition of property to the extent included in arriving at Consolidated Net Income.\nOur management strives to aggressively control costs and improve operating performance to mitigate external cost pressures. We experience volatility in operating costs related to fuel, explosives, steel, tires, contract services and healthcare, among others, and take measures to mitigate the increases in these costs at all operations. We have a centralized sourcing group for major supplier contract negotiation and administration, for the negotiation and purchase of major capital goods, and to support the business units. We promote competition between suppliers and seek to develop relationships with suppliers that focus on lowering our costs. We seek suppliers who identify and concentrate on implementing continuous improvement opportunities within their area of expertise. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. We may also experience difficult geologic conditions, delays in obtaining permits, labor shortages, unforeseen equipment problems, and unexpected shortages of critical materials such as tires, fuel and explosives that may result in adverse cost increases and limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels.\nIn the event that there shall be Excess Cash Flow for any fiscal quarter commencing with the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2019, pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we will, no later than 70 days after the end of such fiscal quarter (or 130 days in the case of the last fiscal quarter of any fiscal year), prepay the loan amounts under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, based on the Total Leverage Ratio as follows:\nNet cash flows from operating activities consist of net income adjusted for non-cash items, such as depreciation, depletion and amortization, amortization of acquired intangibles, net, accretion and settlement of acquisition-related obligations discount,\nThe following tables summarize certain financial information relating to our operating results that have been derived from our combined financial statements for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016. Also included is certain information relating to the operating results as a percentage of total revenues.\n\nAs a regular part of our business, we review opportunities for, and engage in discussions and negotiations concerning, the acquisition or disposition of coal mining and related infrastructure assets and interests in coal mining companies, and acquisitions or dispositions of, or combinations or other strategic transactions involving companies with coal mining or other energy assets. When we believe that these opportunities are consistent with our strategic plans and our acquisition or disposition criteria, we will make bids or proposals and/or enter into letters of intent and other similar agreements. These bids or proposals, which may be binding or non-binding, are customarily subject to a variety of conditions and usually permit us to terminate the discussions and any related agreement if, among other things, we are not satisfied with the results of due diligence. Any acquisition opportunities we pursue could materially affect our liquidity and capital resources and may require us to incur indebtedness, seek equity capital or both. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $170.3 million, primarily attributable to principal repayments of debt of $369.5 million, special dividend paid of $100.7 million, debt extinguishment costs of $25.0 million, debt issuance costs of $14.4 million, and common stock repurchases and related expenses of $49.9 million, partially offset by borrowings on debt of $396.0 million.\n(2) Does not include $363.1 million of freight and handling fulfillment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\n \u2022 Coal Quality. The energy content or heat value of thermal coal is a significant factor influencing coal prices as higher energy coal is more desirable to consumers and typically commands a higher price in the market. The heat value of coal is commonly measured in British thermal units or the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. Coal from the eastern and midwest regions of the United States tends to have a higher heat value than coal found in the western United States. Coal volatility is a significant factor influencing met coal pricing as coal with a lower volatility has historically been more highly valued and typically commands a higher price in the market. The volatility refers to the loss in mass, less moisture, when coal is heated in the absence of air. The volatility of met coal determines the percentage of feed coal that actually becomes coke, known as coke yield, with lower volatility producing a higher coke yield. \nSale of PRB Operations\nIncluded below are reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures.\n (1) Our Adjusted EBITDA calculation has been modified to add back non-cash stock compensation expense and accretion on asset retirement obligations, a non-cash expense, to align with industry peer group methodology. \nThe mark-to-market gain on acquisition-related obligations of $10.6 million for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016 consisted of a mark-to-market gain of $17.4 million related to the Contingent Credit Support Commitment and a mark-to-market loss of $6.8 million related to the Contingent Reclamation Funding Liability.\n \u2022 The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is an assumption of the rate of return on plan assets reflecting the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. We establish the expected long-term rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon historical returns and projected returns on the underlying mix of invested assets. The Pension Plans investment targets are 40% equity securities and 60% debt securities. Investments are rebalanced on a periodic basis to stay within these targeted guidelines. The long-term rate of return assumption used to determine net periodic benefit expense was 5.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The long-term rate of return assumption to be used in 2019 is expected to be 5.8%. Any difference between the actual experience and the assumed experience is deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss and amortized into expense in future periods. \nContura was incorporated in the State of Delaware on June 10, 2016 to acquire and operate certain of Alpha's core coal operations, as part of the Alpha Restructuring. On July 26, 2016, a consortium of former Alpha creditors acquired our common stock in exchange for a partial release of their creditor claims pursuant to the Alpha Restructuring. Furthermore, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement between Contura and Alpha, we purchased certain former core coal operations of Alpha.\nWe meet frequently with our surety providers and have discussions with certain providers regarding the extent of and the terms of their participation in the program. These discussions may cause us to shift surety bonds between providers or to alter the terms of their participation in our program. To the extent that surety bonds become unavailable or our surety bond providers require additional collateral, we would seek to secure our obligations with letters of credit, cash deposits or other suitable forms of collateral. Our failure to maintain, or inability to acquire, surety bonds or to provide a suitable alternative would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. These failures could result from a variety of factors including lack of availability, higher cost or unfavorable market terms of new surety bonds, and the exercise by third-party surety bond issuers of their right to refuse to renew the surety.\n(2) Pursuant to the PRB divestiture and classification as a discontinued operation, we are no longer presenting a PRB reporting segment. The former PRB reporting segment had Adjusted EBITDA of $41.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable segments is a non-GAAP financial measure. This non-GAAP financial measure is presented as a supplemental measure and is not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, this measure is not calculated identically by all companies and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is presented because ANR's management believes it is a useful indicator of the financial performance of our coal operations. The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016:\nThe following discussion and analysis provides a narrative of our results of operations and financial condition for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (Successor), the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016 (Successor), and the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016 (Predecessor). The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes and the risk factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNAPP operations. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $10.1 million, or 18.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to decreased coal margin per ton of $0.89. The decrease in coal margin per ton consisted of increased average cost of coal sales per ton of $2.00, or approximately 5.5%, due primarily to reductions in tons sold due to geological factors during the current period.\nCost of coal sales. Cost of coal sales increased $218.1 million, or 20.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by increased purchases of tons associated with our Trading and Logistics operations segment, increased labor costs, and increased repair and maintenance activities during the current period.\n\nPursuant to the Amended and Restated Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement, during any Liquidity Period (capitalized terms as defined in the Amended and Restated Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement), our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio cannot be less than 1.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of any Test Period, commencing with the Test Period ended immediately preceding the commencement of such Liquidity Period. The Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is calculated as (a) Consolidated EBITDA of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries for such period, minus non-financed Capital Expenditures (including Capital Expenditures financed with the proceeds of any Loans) paid or payable currently in cash by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for such period to (b) the Fixed Charges of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries during such period. As of April 1, 2019, we were not in a Liquidity Period.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016 was $41.5 million, primarily attributable to $42.5 million of proceeds from borrowings on debt.\nOther\nContingent Revenue Obligation. Our contingent revenue obligation was assumed in connection with the Merger. Determining the fair value of this obligation requires management's judgment and the utilization of independent valuation experts, and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to forecasts of future revenues, revenue volatility, and discount rates. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual payments made under the obligation could differ materially from our current estimates. For a further discussion of the factors that could result in a change in our assumptions, see Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016 was $35.8 million, primarily attributable to transfers to Alpha.\nAcquisition-related obligations. For the year ended December 31, 2018 the Company recorded a mark-to-market loss on acquisition-related obligations of $24 thousand related to the Contingent Revenue Obligation. The mark-to-market loss on acquisition-related obligations of $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily consisted of a mark-to-market loss of $2.5 million related to the Contingent Reclamation Funding Liability and a mark-to-market loss of $0.7 million related to the Contingent Credit Support Commitment. The gain on settlement of acquisition-related obligations of $38.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily consisted of the UMWA Contingent VEBA Funding Notes 1 and Note 2 settlements.\nAcquisition-Related Obligations\nAll Other category. Adjusted EBITDA was ($18.0) million for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016, primarily driven by wages and benefits expense of $7.4 million, professional fees of $4.0 million, incentive pay of $3.2 million, and rent, utilities and property costs of $0.6 million\nNAPP operations. Adjusted EBITDA was $28.2 million for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016, driven by coal margin per ton of $8.87, coal sales realization per ton of $45.00 and cost of coal sales per ton of $36.13.\nAll Other category. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $3.3 million, or 8.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by increases in incentive pay and severance related expenses during the current period.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had total liquidity of $429.9 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $233.6 million and $196.3 million of unused commitments available under the Amended and Restated Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement, subject to limitations described therein. On November 9, 2018, we entered into a $550.0 million term loan credit facility under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with a maturity date of November 9, 2025, and a $225.0 million asset-based revolving credit facility under the Amended and Restated Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement expiring on April 3, 2022. Refer to Note 15 for disclosures on long-term debt.\ncharges permitted to be added back pursuant to this clause (iv) for a four-quarter period shall not exceed 20% of Consolidated EBITDA for such period (calculated before giving effect to such add-back); (v) any expenses, costs or charges related to any equity offering, Investment permitted, acquisition, disposition, recapitalization or Indebtedness permitted to be incurred by the indenture (whether or not successful); (vi) all non-recurring or unusual losses, charges and expenses (and less all non-recurring or unusual gains); (vii) all non-cash charges and expenses; (viii) any debt extinguishment costs; (ix) any amount of asset retirement obligations expenses; (x) all Transaction Costs incurred in connection with the Transactions contemplated hereby; (xi) transaction costs, fees and expenses incurred during such period in connection with any acquisition or disposition not prohibited hereunder or any issuance of debt or equity securities by the surviving Parent, the Borrowers or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case, for such expenses; and (xii) commissions, premiums, discounts, fees or other charges relating to performance bonds, bid bonds, appeal bonds, surety bonds, wage bonds, bonds issued in favor of any Governmental Authority, reclamation and completion guarantees and other similar obligations; provided that, with respect to any Restricted Subsidiary, such items will be added only to the extent and in the same proportion that the relevant Restricted Subsidiary's net income was included in calculating Consolidated Net Income.\neffects of the PRB operations being reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 4 for further information on discontinued operations. The Merger with Alpha Natural Resources Holdings, Inc. and ANR, Inc. was completed on November 9, 2018. Refer to Note 3 for information on terms of the Merger Agreement.\n(1) Management restructuring costs are related to severance expense associated with senior management changes in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIn addition, our cost of coal sales includes idle and closed mine costs and purchased coal costs. Additionally due to the Merger, our cost of coal sales includes the cost impact of coal inventory fair value adjustments. In the following table, we calculate adjusted cost of produced coal sold as cost of coal sales less idle and closed mine costs, cost impact of coal inventory fair value adjustments and purchased coal costs.\nTrading and Logistics operations. Adjusted EBITDA was ($1.2) million for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016, driven by coal margin per ton of $5.63, coal sales realization per ton of $54.64 and cost of coal sales per ton of $49.01.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017 (Successor)\nassumptions and return on plan assets to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could affect our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. As of December 31, 2018, we had estimated black lung obligations of approximately $92.2 million, including amounts reported as current and $94 thousand related to discontinued operations, which are net of assets of $2.6 million that are held in a tax-exempt trust fund.\n\nIncome tax benefit of $39.9 million was recorded for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016 on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $101.4 million. The income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the impact of the percentage depletion allowance and state income taxes, net of federal tax impact, partially offset by the impact of the non-deductible transaction costs. See Note 21 for additional information.\nwith GAAP. Moreover, this measure is not calculated identically by all companies and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is presented because management believes it is a useful indicator of the financial performance of our coal operations. The following tables presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $102.2 million, primarily driven by cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash acquired in acquisition, net of amounts paid of $198.5 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $81.9 million, payments on disposition of assets of $10.3 million, and capital contributions to equity affiliates of $5.3 million.\n\n\nCosts and Expenses\nMet coal volumes increased 2.2 million tons due to increased export sales during the current period, and average coal realization per ton decreased $0.05. Thermal coal volumes decreased 0.3 million tons due to increased longwall moves and geological factors during the current period, and average coal realization per ton increased $0.62. The increase in coal revenues consisted of increased met coal revenue of $272.9 million, or 24.7%, partially offset by decreased thermal coal revenue of $7.6 million, or 2.7%.\n (1) Does not include any portion of the price paid by our export customers to transport coal to the relevant outbound shipping port. \n(2) Includes capital lease obligation principal amounts of $2.1 million in 2019, $1.5 million in 2020, $1.6 million in 2021, and $1.2 million in 2022. Cash interest payable on these obligations with interest rates ranging between 0.39% and 9.50%, would be approximately $0.2 million in 2019, $0.1 million in 2020, $0.1 million in 2021, and $16 thousand in 2022. Other debt includes principal amounts of $0.6 million in 2019, $0.7 million in 2020, $0.6 million in 2021, and $32 thousand in 2022.\nCoal revenues. Coal revenues increased $265.3 million, or 19.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. The increase in coal revenues was due primarily to increased revenues of 41.5% and 9.5% for CAPP - Met and our Trading and Logistics operations, respectively, and the addition of revenues from the CAPP - Thermal operations during the current year period, partially offset by decreased revenues of 6.8% for NAPP.\nBlackjewel's performance obligations are also collateralized by a security interest in mobile equipment granted to Contura under 8.6(c) of the Asset Purchase Agreement. Further, in connection with this arrangement, approximately $8.0 million in surety cash collateral previously supporting reclamation bonds was returned to Contura by certain of its sureties.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $22.7 million, primarily attributable to net proceeds from borrowings on debt of $537.8 million, partially offset by principal repayments of debt of $471.7 million, common stock repurchases and related expenses of $20.3 million, debt issuance costs of $14.9 million, form S-4 costs of $3.9 million, and principal repayments of notes payable of $3.8 million.\nIncome tax benefit of $68.0 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 on income from continuing operations before income taxes of $105.8 million. The effective tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the impact of the percentage depletion allowance and the reduction in the valuation allowance, partially offset by the revaluation of the net deferred tax assets as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See Note 21 for additional information.\nLong-Term Debt\nadditional bank credit facilities. The sale of equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of additional indebtedness could result in increased fixed obligations and additional covenants that could restrict our operations.\n\n\n \u2022 Third-Party Margin. The measurement of an obligation at fair value is based upon the amount a third-party would demand to perform the obligation. Because we plan to perform a significant amount of the reclamation activities with internal resources, a third-party margin was added to the estimated costs of these activities. This margin was estimated based upon our historical experience with contractors performing similar types of reclamation activities. The inclusion of this margin will result in a recorded obligation that is greater than our estimates of our cost to perform the reclamation activities. If our cost estimates are accurate, the excess of the recorded obligation over the cost incurred to perform the work will be recorded within depreciation, depletion and amortization within our Consolidated Statements of Operations at the time that reclamation work is completed.  On at least an annual basis, we review our reclamation liabilities and make necessary adjustments for permit changes as granted by state authorities, additional costs resulting from accelerated mine closures, and revisions to cost estimates and productivity assumptions, to reflect current experience and updated plans. At December 31, 2018, we had recorded asset retirement obligation liabilities of $228.4 million, including amounts reported as current, and $1.4 million asset retirement obligations liabilities classified as held for sale. While the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with certainty, as of December 31, 2018, we estimate that the aggregate undiscounted cost of final mine closures is approximately $619.2 million.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $42.6 million, or 122.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. The increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization primarily related to increased purchases of machinery and equipment, increased asset development during the current period, and additions of property, plant and equipment as a result of the Merger.\n (1) Cost of coal sales per ton exclude costs associated with our All Other category. \nWe sponsor three qualified non-contributory pension plans ( Pension Plans\u201d) which cover certain salaried and non-union hourly employees. Participants accrued benefits either based on certain formulas, the participant's compensation prior to retirement or plan specified amounts for each year of service. Benefits are frozen under these Pension Plans. Annual funding contributions to the Pension Plans are made as recommended by consulting actuaries based upon the ERISA funding standards. Funding decisions also consider certain funded status thresholds defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. We expect to contribute $6.4 million to the Pension Plans in 2019. See Note 22 for further disclosures related to this obligation.\nContura agreed to backstop a total of $44.8 million of Blackjewel's bonding obligations with respect to the Belle Ayr and Eagle Butte permits by entering into secondary general indemnification agreements and providing letters of credit totaling $18.8 million to the sureties as collateral for Contura's indemnification obligations. This arrangement provides cost reimbursement for the issuing sureties. Indemnity bonds were issued by a third-party insurer in favor of Contura in a total amount of $26.0 million to insure Blackjewel's performance obligations to Contura with respect to cancellation of the general indemnification agreements and return of the letters of credit.\nIn addition, we generate other revenues from equipment sales, rentals, terminal and processing fees, coal and environmental analysis fees, royalties and the sale of natural gas. We also record freight and handling fulfillment revenue within coal revenues for freight and handling services provided in delivering coal to certain customers, which are a component of the contractual selling price.\nCAPP - Met operations. Adjusted EBITDA increased $61.4 million, or 35.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by increased average sales realization per ton of $7.30, or approximately 6.2%, due primarily to increases in the market pricing of coal during the current period and increased sales volumes.\nOur sales mix of met coal and thermal coal based on volume was 63.2% and 36.8%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 56.9% and 43.1%, respectively, in the prior year period. Our sales mix of met coal and thermal coal based on coal revenues, excluding freight and handling fulfillment revenues, was 83.2% and 16.8%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 79.4% and 20.6%, respectively, for the prior year period.\n(3) See Note 16 for further disclosures related to this obligation.\n(1) Includes Term Loan Credit Facility principal amounts of $27.5 million in 2019, $27.5 million in 2020, $27.5 million in 2021, $27.5 million in 2022, $27.5 million in 2023, and $412.5 million after 2023. Cash interest payable on this obligation, with an interest rate of 7.39%, would be approximately $40.4 million in 2019, $38.5 million in 2020, $36.3 million in 2021, $34.2 million in 2022, $32.2 million in 2023, and $54.4 million after 2023. Also includes Lexington Coal Company ( LCC\u201d) Note Payable principal amounts of $17.5 million in 2019, $17.5 million in 2020, $17.5 million in 2021, and $10.0 million in 2022 and LCC Water Treatment Stipulation principal amounts of $1.9 million in 2019, $2.5 million in 2020, $2.5 million in 2021, $2.5 million in 2022, and $2.5 million in 2023.\nOther (income) expense. Other (income) expense decreased $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. This decrease primarily related to the gain on disposal of assets of $16.9 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the sale of a disposal group within the Company's CAPP - Met segment.\n\nBlackjewel agreed that, by June 30, 2019, it will (i) enter into financing arrangements of $44.8 million to be held as collateral by the sureties and (ii) cause each surety to release and return each letter of credit and cancel the Contura general indemnification agreements.\nThe increase in CAPP - Met revenues was primarily due to higher coal sales volume of 1.3 million tons and increases in coal sales realization of $7.30 per ton. CAPP - Thermal revenues consisted of 0.6 million tons sold at a coal sales realization of $56.46 per ton. The decrease in NAPP revenues was primarily due to lower coal sales volumes of 0.6 million tons, partially offset by higher coal sales realization of $1.11 per ton. The increase in Trading and Logistics coal revenues was primarily due to higher sales volumes of 0.6 million tons, partially offset by lower coal sales realization of $4.12 per ton.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe are required to provide financial assurance in order to perform the post-mining reclamation required by our mining permits, pay our federal production royalties, pay workers' compensation claims under workers' compensation laws in various states, pay federal black lung benefits, and perform certain other obligations. In order to provide the required financial assurance, we generally use surety bonds for post-mining reclamation and workers' compensation obligations. We can also use bank letters of credit to collateralize certain obligations.\nFactors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nOur results of operations for the Successor period for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are discussed in these Results of Operations\u201d presented below. Given the change in basis that resulted from the Acquisition on July 26, 2016, we separately discuss our Successor and Predecessor results of operations and segment results for the results of operations for 2016.\nManagement uses non-GAAP financial measures to supplement GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the presentations of these measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and can differ significantly from company to company depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate, and capital investments.\n\nAnalysis of Material Debt Covenants\n (2) Pursuant to the PRB divestiture and classification as a discontinued operation, we are no longer presenting a PRB reporting segment. The former PRB reporting segment had adjusted EBITDA of $45.8 million for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016. \nFreight and handling fulfillment revenues were $363.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $115.7 million, or 46.8%, compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to increased shipments by rail car and increased shipping rates during the current period.\nour coal. However, coal prices are influenced by global market conditions beyond our control. If actual coal prices are less than our expectations, it could have a material impact on the fair value of our reporting units. Our forecasts of costs to produce coal are based on our operating forecasts and an assumed inflation rate for materials and supplies such as steel, diesel fuel and explosives. However, the costs of the materials and supplies used in our production process such as steel, diesel fuel and explosives are influenced by global market conditions beyond our control. If actual costs are higher or if inflation increases above our expectations, it could have a material impact on the fair value of our reporting units. We also are faced with increasingly stringent safety standards and governmental regulation, much of which is beyond our control, which could increase our costs and materially decrease the fair value of our reporting units. For a further discussion of the factors that could result in a change in our assumptions, see Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nBusiness Combinations. We account for our business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying identifiable net tangible and intangible assets based on their respective estimated fair values. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment, the utilization of independent valuation experts and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, market prices and asset lives, among other items.\n (1) Cost of coal sales per ton exclude costs associated with our All Other category. \n(1) Coal margin per ton for our reportable segments is calculated as coal sales realization per ton for our reportable segments less cost of coal sales per ton for our reportable segments. Coal margin per ton is not shown for our All Other category since it has no coal sales or coal production related to our continuing operations.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $314.3 million and was primarily attributed to net income of $154.5 million adjusted for depreciation, depletion and amortization of $65.0 million, amortization of acquired intangibles, net of $59.0 million, accretion on asset retirement obligations of $21.3 million, loss on sale of Powder River Basin of $36.1 million, stock based compensation of $20.4 million, and loss on modification and extinguishment of debt of $38.7 million, partially offset by a $38.9 million gain on settlement of acquisition-related obligations and changes in deferred income taxes of $78.7 million. The change in our operating assets and liabilities of $9.8 million was primarily attributed to decreases in trade accounts receivable, net of $34.8 million, decreases in deposits of $38.4 million, and decreases in other non-current assets of $24.5 million, partially offset by increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $40.4 million, decreases in acquisition-related obligations of $22.8 million, and decreases in other non-current liabilities of $16.5 million.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\n(2) During the fourth quarter of 2017, we entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell a disposal group (comprised of property, plant and equipment and associated asset retirement obligations) within our CAPP - Met segment. From the date we entered into the asset purchase agreement through the transaction close date, the property, plant and equipment and associated asset retirement obligations were classified as held for sale in amounts representing the fair value of the disposal group. Upon permit transfer, the transaction closed on April 2, 2018. We paid $10.0 million in connection with the transaction, which was paid into escrow on March 27, 2018 and transferred to the buyer at the transaction close date, and expect to pay a series of additional cash payments in the aggregate amount of $1.5 million, per the terms stated in the agreement, and recorded a gain on sale of approximately $16.4 million within other (income) expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n\nCAPP - Met operations. Adjusted EBITDA was $0.6 million for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016, driven by coal margin per ton of $0.86, coal sales realization per ton of $60.14 and cost of coal sales per ton of $59.28.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nTotal revenues. Total revenues increased $381.2 million, or 23.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. The increase in total revenues was due to increased coal revenues of $265.3 million, increased freight and handling fulfillment revenues of $115.7 million and increased other revenues of $0.2 million.\nRevenues\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding surety bonds with a total face amount of $581.4 million to secure various obligations and commitments, including $237.2 million related to the PRB. To secure our reclamation-related obligations, we currently have $137.3 million of collateral supporting these obligations. Once the permits associated with the PRB Transaction have been transferred, the Company estimates approximately $12.6 million comprised of short-term restricted cash and short-term deposits will be returned to operating cash.\n\nThe calculation of the net periodic benefit expense/credit and projected benefit obligation associated with our Pension Plans requires the use of a number of assumptions, which are used by our independent actuaries to make the underlying calculations. Changes in these assumptions can result in different net periodic benefit expense and liability amounts, and actual experience can differ from the assumptions.\n\nWe are a large-scale provider of met and thermal coal to a global customer base, operating high-quality, cost-competitive coal mines across two major U.S. coal basins (CAPP and NAPP) along with a robust Trading and Logistics business. As of December 31, 2018, our operations consisted of thirty-two active mines and twelve coal preparation and load-out facilities, with approximately 4,420 employees. We produce, process, and sell met coal and thermal coal from operations located in Virginia, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. We also sell coal produced by others, some of which is processed and/or blended with coal produced from our mines prior to resale, with the remainder purchased for resale by our trading operations. As of December 31, 2018, we had 1.3 billion tons of reserves, including 885.5 million tons of proven reserves and 462.9 million tons of probable reserves.\nTo secure our obligations under certain worker's compensation, black lung, reclamation-related obligations, general liabilities, and financial guarantees, we are required to provide cash collateral. At December 31, 2018, we had cash collateral in the amounts of $243.6 million, $24.0 million, and $29.1 million classified as short-term and long-term restricted cash, short-term and long-term deposits, and long-term restricted investments, respectively, on our balance sheet. Once the permits associated with the PRB transaction have been transferred, we estimate approximately $12.6 million, comprised of short-term restricted cash and short-term deposits, will be returned to operating cash. If the permit transfer process is not completed as expected, it could have material, adverse effects on us.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements. See Note 2 for disclosures related to new accounting policies adopted.\nConsolidated EBITDA is calculated in accordance with our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and is equal to Consolidated Net Income plus, without duplication (i) consolidated interest expense; (ii) to the extent deducted in computing such Consolidated Net Income, the sum of all income, franchise or similar taxes; (iii) depreciation, depletion, amortization (including, without limitation, amortization of intangibles, deferred financing fees and any amortization included in pension or other employee benefit expenses) and all other non-cash items reducing Consolidated Net Income (including, without limitation, write-downs and impairment of property, plant, equipment and intangibles and other long-lived assets and the impact of acquisition accounting, but excluding, in each case, non-cash charges in a period which reflect cash expenses paid or to be paid in another period); (iv) non-recurring restructuring costs, expenses and charges, including, without limitation, all business optimization costs and expenses, facility opening, pre-opening and closing and consolidation costs and expenses, advisory and professional fees and stay and retention bonuses; provided that the amount of non-recurring restructuring costs, expenses and\nCAPP- Met operations. Adjusted EBITDA was $46.4 million for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016, driven by coal margin per ton of $32.59, coal sales realization per ton of $99.41 and cost of coal sales per ton of $66.82.\n\n \u2022 Regional Supply and Demand. Our realized price per ton is influenced by market forces of the regional market into which such coal is to be sold. Market pricing may vary according to region and lead to different discounts or premiums to the most directly comparable benchmark price for such coal product.  Costs. Our results of operations are dependent upon our ability to improve productivity and control costs. Our primary expenses are for operating supply costs, repair and maintenance expenditures, cost of purchased coal, royalties, current wages and benefits, freight and handling costs and taxes incurred in selling our coal. Principal goods and services we use in our operations include maintenance and repair parts and services, electricity, fuel, roof control and support items, explosives, tires, conveyance structure, ventilation supplies and lubricants.\nConsolidated Net Income is calculated in accordance with our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and is equal to the net income determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding, without duplication, noncash compensation expenses related to common stock and other equity securities issued to employees, extraordinary and non-recurring gains and loss, income or losses from discontinued operations or disposal of discontinued operations or costs and expense associated with the closure of any minds (including any reclamation or disposal obligations), any non-cash impairment charges or asset write-offs resulting from the application of certain ASC standards, net unrealized gains or losses resulting from non-cash foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses, net unrealized gains or losses results in such period from certain derivatives, non-cash charges including non-cash charges due to cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles, any net income or loss of any person that is not a restricted subsidiary or that is accounted for by equity method accounting except to the extent the dividends or similar distributions are paid in cash to the specified person or restricted subsidiary, the net income (but not loss) of any restricted subsidiary to the extent that the declaration or payment of dividends or similar distributions by that restricted subsidiary of that net income is not at the date of determination permitted without any prior governmental approval (that has not been obtained) or, directly or indirectly, by operation of the terms of its charter or any agreement, instrument, judgment, decree, order, statute, rule or governmental regulation applicable to that restricted subsidiary or its stockholders (other than any restriction that has been waived or released), plus, without duplication, any cash dividends and/or distributions actually received by the Company or restricted subsidiary from any unrestricted subsidiary and/or joint venture to the extent not already included therein.\nSee Note 16 for additional details and disclosures on acquisition-related obligations.\nInterest expense of $20.5 million for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016 consisted of the accrued interest on debt instruments and acquisition-related obligations, including discounts, resulting from the Acquisition.\n (2) Pursuant to the PRB divestiture and classification as a discontinued operation, we are no longer presenting a PRB reporting segment. The former PRB reporting segment had adjusted EBITDA of $36.9 million for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016. \nFreight and handling costs. Freight and handling costs increased $115.7 million, or 46.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to increased shipments by rail car and increased shipping rates during the current period.\nMerger with Alpha Natural Resources Holdings, Inc. and ANR, Inc.\nWe began operations on July 26, 2016, with mining operations in NAPP, the PRB, and CAPP. Through the Acquisition, Contura acquired a significant reserve base. We also acquired Alpha's 40.6% interest in the DTA coal export terminal in eastern Virginia, and on March 31, 2017, we acquired a portion of another partner's ownership stake and increased our interest to 65.0%. On December 8, 2017, the Company closed a transaction to sell the Eagle Butte and Belle Ayr mines located in the PRB, Wyoming, along with related coal reserves, equipment, infrastructure and other real properties. The PRB results of operations and financial position are reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The historical information in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements has been restated to reflect the\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n(3) The cost impact of the coal inventory fair value adjustment as a result of the Alpha Merger is expected to have short-term impact.\nReclamation. Our asset retirement obligations arise from the federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 and similar state statutes, which require that mine property be restored in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan. Significant reclamation activities include reclaiming refuse and slurry ponds, reclaiming the pit and support acreage at surface mines, sealing portals at deep mines and the treatment of water. We determine the future cash flows necessary to satisfy our reclamation obligations on a permit-by-permit basis based upon current permit requirements and various estimates and assumptions, including estimates of disturbed acreage, cost estimates, and assumptions regarding productivity. We are also faced with increasingly stringent environmental regulation, much of which is beyond our control, which could increase our costs and materially increase our asset retirement obligations. Estimates of disturbed acreage are determined based on approved mining plans and related engineering data. Cost estimates are based upon third-party costs. Productivity assumptions are based on historical experience with the equipment that is expected to be utilized in the reclamation activities. Our asset retirement obligations are initially recorded at fair value. In order to determine fair value, we use assumptions including a discount rate and third-party margin. Each is discussed further below:\nOur sales of met coal were made primarily to steel companies in the northeastern and midwestern regions of the United States and in several countries in Europe, Asia and the Americas. Our sales of thermal coal were made primarily to large utilities and industrial customers throughout the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016, and the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016 approximately 82.7%, 77.2%, 71.2%, and 39.3%, respectively, of our total coal revenues, including freight and handling revenues, were derived from coal sales made to customers outside the United States.\nSelling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $8.2 million, or 12.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. This decrease in expense was primarily related to decreases of $7.2 million in stock compensation expense and $5.1 million in professional services fees, partially offset by increases of $3.0 million in incentive bonus plans and $2.5 million in severance pay during the current period.\nThe Merger with ANR, Inc. ( ANR\u201d) and Alpha Natural Resources Holdings, Inc. ( Holdings\u201d, and, together with ANR, the \"Alpha Companies\u201d) was completed on November 9, 2018 (the Merger\u201d or the Alpha Merger\u201d). For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Alpha Companies' financial results are included in the Financial Statements for the period from November 9, 2018 through December 31, 2018. The Alpha Companies' financial results are not included in the Financial Statements in periods prior to November 9, 2018. Refer to Note 3 for information on Alpha Merger and terms of the Merger Agreement.\nRealized Pricing. Our realized price per ton of coal is influenced by many factors that vary by region, including (i) coal quality, which includes energy (heat content), sulfur, ash, volatile matter and moisture content; (ii) differences in market conventions concerning transportation costs and volume measurement; and (iii) regional supply and demand.\nThe following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\n \u2022 The discount rate represents our estimate of the interest rate at which pension benefits could be effectively settled. Assumed discount rates are used in the measurement of the projected and accumulated benefit obligations and the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense. In estimating that rate, we use rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments. The weighted average discount rate used to determine pension expense was 4.23% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The differences resulting from actual versus assumed discount rates are amortized into pension expense/credit over the remaining average life of the active plan participants. A one percentage-point increase in the discount rate would increase the net periodic pension cost for the year ended December 31, 2018 by approximately $1.9 million and decrease the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2018 by approximately $88.0 million. The corresponding effects of a one percentage-point decrease in discount rate would decrease the net periodic pension cost for the year ended December 31, 2018 by approximately $2.9 million and increase the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2018 by approximately $111.6 million.  Coal Workers' Pneumoconiosis. We are required by federal and state statues to provide benefits to employees for awards related to coal workers' pneumoconiosis disease (black lung). Certain of our subsidiaries are insured for black lung obligations by a third-party insurance provider. Certain subsidiaries in West Virginia are self-insured for state black lung obligations. Certain other subsidiaries are self-insured for black lung benefits and may fund benefit payments through Section 501(c)(21) tax-exempt trust fund. Provisions are made for estimated benefits based on annual evaluations prepared by independent actuaries. Charges are made to operations for self-insured black lung claims, as determined by an independent actuary at the present value of the actuarially computed liability for such benefits over the employee's applicable term of service. These actuarially determined liabilities use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate, future cost trends, demographic\nTotal revenues were $506.3 million for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016 and consisted of coal revenues of $431.7 million, freight and handling revenues of $70.5 million and other revenues of $4.1 million. Our sales mix of met coal and thermal coal based on volume was 52.8% and 47.2%, respectively, and our sales mix of met coal and thermal coal based on coal revenues was 72.4% and 27.6%, respectively, for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016. Average coal sales realization per ton was $74.34. CAPP - Met, NAPP, and Trading and Logistics operations' coal revenues comprised 27%, 26%, and 32%, respectively, of total revenues for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016.\n(1) The estimated undiscounted cash flows will be paid from the defined benefit pension plan assets held within the defined benefit pension plan trust. See Note 22 for further disclosures related to this obligation.\nIncome tax benefit of $1.9 million was recorded for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016 on loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $13.8 million. The income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the impact of the non-deductible mark-to-market adjustment for the warrant derivative liability, partially offset by the impact of the percentage depletion allowance and the reduction in the valuation allowance. See Note 21 for additional information.\nNAPP operations. Adjusted EBITDA was $35.5 million for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016, driven by coal margin per ton of $7.87, coal sales realization per ton of $43.93 and cost of coal sales per ton of $36.06.\nSales Volume. We earn revenues primarily through the sale of coal produced at our operations and resale of coal purchased from third parties. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold 5.7 million tons of met coal from CAPP - Met, CAPP - Thermal, and NAPP, 5.4 million tons of met coal from our Trading and Logistics business, 6.4 million tons of thermal coal from CAPP - Met, CAPP - Thermal, and NAPP, and 0.1 million tons of thermal coal from our Trading and Logistics business. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold 4.1 million tons of met coal from CAPP - Met and NAPP, 4.8 million tons\n\nThe PRB results of operations and financial position are reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The historical information in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements has been restated to reflect the effects of the PRB operations being reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The discontinued operations include our former PRB segment. To conform with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes, the former PRB segment information for the discontinued operation has been eliminated. See Note 4 for further information on discontinued operations. The following tables summarize certain financial information relating to the PRB discontinued operating results that have been derived from our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016, and the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016.\nInvesting Activities\nOn November 9, 2018, Contura, along with the Alpha Companies, completed the Merger in which the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding Class C-1 shares of ANR and the 100% of the outstanding shares of Holdings. Prior to the closing of the transaction, the Alpha Companies stockholders also received a special cash dividend (the Dividend\u201d). Refer to Note 3 for additional disclosures surrounding these amounts. Additionally, on November 6, 2018, Contura, the Alpha Companies and the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (the WVDEP\u201d) entered into a binding term sheet agreement to resolve certain issues related to the issuance of the Dividend under the Permitting and Reclamation Plan Settlement Agreement for the State of West Virginia dated as of July 12, 2016. The agreement, among other things, required the posting of collateral to secure Contura's and ANR's payment obligations under the Amended Reclamation Funding Agreement and the Amended Settlement Agreement until a performance bond was issued as described in the following sentence. The performance bond was issued during the fourth quarter of 2018. Refer to Note 26 for disclosures surrounding the WVDEP Settlement Agreement.\nIncome Taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction in which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including the expected reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, taxable income available via carryback to prior years, tax planning strategies, and results of recent operations. We assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets, including scheduling the reversal of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, to determine the amount of valuation allowance needed. Scheduling the reversal of deferred tax asset and liability balances requires judgment and estimation. We believe the deferred tax liabilities relied upon as future taxable income in our assessment will reverse in the same period and jurisdiction and are of the same character as the temporary differences giving rise to the deferred tax assets that will be realized. At December 31, 2018, a valuation allowance of $94.8 million has been provided on federal and state net operating losses and gross deferred tax assets not expected to provide future tax benefits.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $121.3 million, primarily driven by the purchase of additional ownership interest in equity affiliate of $13.3 million, cash paid on the sale of Powder River Basin of $21.4 million, capital expenditures of $83.1 million, and capital contributions to equity affiliates of $5.7 million, partially offset by proceeds on disposal of assets of $2.6 million.\nCosts and Expenses\nIncome taxes. Income tax benefit of $165.4 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018 on income from continuing operations before income taxes of $137.5 million. The effective tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the impact of the net operating loss carryback benefit and the reduction in the valuation allowance.\n(4) Represents obligations under certain equipment purchase agreements that contain minimum quantities to be purchased in 2019.\n(1) Subsequent to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606 during the current year, freight and handling fulfillment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 are included within coal revenues. See Note 5.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had real property collateralizing $26.7 million of reclamation bonds.\n\nWe believe that cash on hand and cash generated from our operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisition-related obligations, and reclamation obligations for the next 12 months. We have relied on a number of assumptions in budgeting for our future activities. These include the costs for mine development to sustain capacity of our operating mines, our cash flows from operations, effects of regulation and taxes by governmental agencies, mining technology improvements and reclamation costs. These assumptions are inherently subject to significant business, political, economic, regulatory, environmental and competitive uncertainties, contingencies and risks, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. We may need to raise additional funds more quickly if market conditions deteriorate, and we may not be able to do so in a timely fashion, or at all; or one or more of our assumptions proves to be incorrect or if we choose to expand our acquisition, exploration, appraisal, or development efforts or any other activity more rapidly than we presently anticipate. We may decide to raise additional funds before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable. We may seek to sell equity or debt securities or obtain\nCost of coal sales was $319.8 million, freight and handling costs were $70.5 million, depreciation, depletion and amortization was $6.0 million, accretion on asset retirement obligations was $4.8 million, amortization of acquired intangibles, net was $61.3 million and selling, general and administrative expenses were $19.1 million for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016.\n\n \u2022 Discount Rate. Asset retirement obligations are initially recorded at fair value. We utilize discounted cash flow techniques to estimate the fair value of our obligations. We base our discount rate on the rates of treasury bonds with maturities similar to expected mine lives and adjust for our credit standing as necessary after considering funding and assurance provisions. Changes in our credit standing could have a material impact on our asset retirement obligations. \nMerger related costs. The Merger related costs of $51.8 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 related primarily to professional fees, severance pay and incentive pay incurred related to the Merger Agreement entered into with the Alpha Companies on April 29, 2018.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased $2.8 million, or 7.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period, primarily due to higher interest costs associated with Company debt as a result of the current year debt refinancing. See Note 15 for additional information.\nCosts and Expenses\nAmortization of acquired intangibles, net. Amortization of acquired intangibles, net decreased $64.4 million, or 109.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. The decrease was primarily driven by the write-off of above-market coal sales contract assets during 2017 associated with the sale of PRB, certain other above-market coal sales contract assets being fully amortized as of December 31, 2017, and the amortization related to below-market acquired intangibles acquired as a result of the Merger, partially offset by the accelerated amortization of acquired intangibles related to the above-market coal sales contract asset related to FirstEnergy Generation, LLC during the current period.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016 was $25.0 million, driven by capital expenditures of $23.4 million and capital contributions to equity affiliates of $2.1 million, partially offset by proceeds on disposal of assets of $0.5 million.\nThe bargain purchase gain of $7.7 million for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016 resulted from the excess of the fair value of the acquired assets over liabilities assumed through the Acquisition.\nThe change in fair value of the Contingent Credit Support Commitment resulted from a reduction in our estimated obligation to provide ANR with revolving credit support. The fair value calculation was based on a probability-weighted scenario analysis. The inputs to this analysis included ANR's projected short-term cash flows, which were derived from the ANR financial statements and operating budget provided pursuant to the terms of the agreement. The cash position of ANR at December 31, 2016 increased relative to the projections used at the Acquisition Date resulting in a gain of $17.4 million in the estimated fair value of this obligation. Based on relevant factors including ANR's current cash balance, near-term estimated met coal prices, the September 30, 2018 termination date to loan funds, and the provision that loans can only be requested if ANR's unrestricted cash is below $20.0 million, we adjusted the liability down to $4.6 million for this obligation. Absent a significant change in ANR's cash position and related projections, we do not expect the obligation to change significantly.\nWe manage our commodity price risk for coal sales through the use of coal supply agreements. As of March 15, 2019, we expect to ship on sales commitments of approximately 6.5 million tons of NAPP coal for 2019, 96% of which is priced at an average realized price per ton of $42.85, 9.3 million tons of CAPP - Met coal for 2019, 60% of which is priced at an average realized price per ton of $123.82, and 4.9 million tons of CAPP - Thermal coal for 2019, 90% of which is priced at an average realized price per ton of $57.67.", "item_7_text": "Additionally, we have long-term liabilities relating to asset retirement obligations, pension, black lung benefits, life insurance benefits, and workers' compensation benefits. The table below reflects the estimated undiscounted cash flows for these obligations: \nTotal revenues were $411.1 million for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016 and consisted of coal revenues of $344.7 million, freight and handling revenues of $52.1 million and other revenues of $14.3 million. Our sales mix of met coal and thermal coal based on volume was 36.8% and 63.2%, respectively, and our sales mix of met coal and thermal coal based on coal revenues was 42.8% and 57.2%, respectively, for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016. Average coal sales realization per ton was $49.24. CAPP - Met, NAPP and Trading and Logistics operations' coal revenues comprised 32%, 50% and 2%, respectively, of total revenues for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016.\nRevenues\nOur primary expenses are operating supply costs, repair and maintenance expenditures, cost of purchased coal, royalties, wages and benefits, post-employment benefits, freight and handling costs, and taxes incurred in selling our coal. Historically, our cost of coal sales per ton is lower for sales of our produced and processed coal than for sales of purchased coal that we do not process prior to resale.\nDuring the third quarter of 2018, Blackjewel L.L.C. ( Blackjewel\u201d) procured surety bonds for a total of $220.5 million to facilitate the transfer of record by the State of Wyoming of the Belle Ayr and Eagle Butte mine permits from Contura Coal West, LLC to Blackjewel as required by the Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of December 7, 2017, among Blackjewel, Contura Energy, Inc. ( Contura\u201d), Contura Coal West, LLC, Contura Wyoming Land, LLC, Contura Coal Sales, LLC, and Contura Energy Services, LLC.\nOperating Activities\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable segments is a financial measure. This non-GAAP financial measure is presented as a supplemental measure and is not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance\nThe following tables summarize certain financial information relating to our operating results that have been derived from our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nThe mark-to-market loss on the warrant derivative liability of $34.0 million for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016 related to the warrants issued in connection with the Acquisition and was calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The warrants are marked to market at each reporting period with changes in value reflected in earnings. The inputs included in the Black-Scholes pricing model include our stock price, the stated exercise price, the expected term, the annual risk-free interest rate based on the U.S. Constant Maturity Curve and annualized equity volatility. The annualized volatility was calculated by observing volatilities for comparable companies with adjustments for our size and leverage. The annualized volatility as of December 31, 2016 decreased relative to the annualized volatility used as of the Acquisition Date due to the significant improvement in our leverage ratio. However, our stock price as of December 31, 2016 was also significantly higher than our stock price at the Acquisition Date and was the primary driver of the mark-to-market loss of $34.0 million recognized for the warrant derivative liability.\nIn the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, operating leases, indemnifications and financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds. Obligations related to these arrangements are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. However, the underlying liabilities that they secure, such as asset retirement obligations, workers' compensation liabilities, and royalty obligations, are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nCAPP - Thermal operations. Adjusted EBITDA for the CAAP - Thermal operations was ($0.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The prior year period did not have any activity in this segment and therefore the current year results explain the entire amount of change. The primary driver for adjusted EBITDA during the current year period related to repair and maintenance costs and costs associated with certain idled properties.\nAll Other category. Adjusted EBITDA was ($29.1) million for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016, primarily driven by wages and benefits expense of $8.9 million, incentive pay of $8.1 million, professional fees of $5.8 million, and rent, utilities and property costs of $5.0 million.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased by $283.3 million, $22.7 million, $171.3 million, and $16.2 million over the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016, and the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016, respectively. The net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash was attributable to the following:\nPeriod from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016 (Successor)\nThe following table summarizes Adjusted EBITDA for our three reportable segments and All Other category:\n (1) Does not include any portion of the price paid by our export customers to transport coal to the relevant outbound shipping port. \nAdditionally, under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, our ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional indebtedness, making investments and paying dividends is also tied to certain financial ratios, including Consolidated EBITDA as defined per the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Consolidated EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash items, non-recurring items, and other adjustments permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. EBITDA, a measure used by management to evaluate our ongoing operations for internal planning and forecasting purposes, is defined as net income (loss) from operations plus interest expense, income tax expense, amortization of acquired intangibles, net and depreciation, depletion and amortization, less interest income and income tax benefit. EBITDA is not a financial measure recognized under United States generally accepted accounting principles and does not purport to be an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. The amounts shown for EBITDA as presented may differ from amounts calculated and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nDuring the third quarter of 2018, we recorded a guarantee within discontinued operations to account for the Blackjewel surety bonding arrangement with no material impact on our financial statements.\nTrading and Logistics operations. Adjusted EBITDA increased $9.4 million, or 10.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to increased sales volumes during the current period and an increase in coal margin per ton of $0.66.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016, and the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016 sales of met coal were 11.1 million tons, 8.9 million tons, 3.1 million tons, and 2.6 million tons, respectively, and accounted for approximately 63.2%, 56.9%, 52.8%, and 36.8%, respectively, of our coal sales volume. Sales of thermal coal were 6.5 million tons, 6.7 million tons, 2.7 million tons, and 4.4 million tons, respectively, and accounted for approximately 36.8%, 43.1%, 47.2%, and 63.2%, respectively, of our coal sales volume. These results include sales from our Trading and Logistics business.\n (1) Our Adjusted EBITDA calculation has been modified to add back non-cash stock compensation expense and accretion on asset retirement obligations, a non-cash expense, to align with industry peer group methodology. \nWe were in compliance with all covenants under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and the Amended and Restated Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement, as of April 1, 2019. A breach of the covenants in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and the Amended and Restated Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement could result in a default under the terms of the agreement and the respective lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed due and payable.\n\n\nSecondary offering costs. The secondary offering costs of $4.5 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to (i) legal fees for drafting the registration statement and other legal services directly related to the withdrawn offering and (ii) financial reporting advisory fees directly related to the withdrawn offering including preparation of the pro forma financial statements and other financial information included in the registration statement.\nRefer to Note 15 for disclosures on long-term debt and Note 3 for financing related to the Merger.\nIn order to test for goodwill impairment, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. However, the loss recognized for any given reporting unit cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the testing discussed above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further assessment.\nDue to the increase in met coal prices and the corresponding improvement to our financial results, our credit-adjusted risk-free rate as of December 31, 2016 decreased relative to the rate used to discount the Contingent Reclamation Funding Liability at the Acquisition Date. The reduction in the credit-adjusted risk-free rate used to discount the projected obligation was the primary driver of the loss of $6.8 million. Due to the long-term nature of this obligation and the uncertainty of ANR's operational results over the life of the obligation, we maintained the expectations utilized at the Acquisition Date related to ANR's expected long-term contributions to the Restricted Cash Reclamation Accounts.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have four reportable segments: CAPP - Met, CAPP - Thermal, NAPP, and Trading and Logistics. See Note 28 for more information about our reportable segments. CAPP - Met consists of twenty-five active mines, including four mines in Virginia operated by third-party contractors, four mines operated by us in Virginia, and seventeen mines operated by us in West Virginia. CAPP - Met operations also include two preparation plants in Virginia, six preparation plants in West Virginia, as well as expenses associated with certain idled and closed mines. The coal produced by the CAPP - Met segment is predominantly met coal with some amounts of thermal coal being produced as a byproduct of mining. CAPP - Thermal consists of six active mines and three preparation plants in West Virginia, as well as expenses associated with certain idle and closed mines. The coal produced by the CAPP - Thermal segment is predominantly thermal coal with some met coal byproduct. NAPP consists of one active mine in Pennsylvania and one preparation plant, as well as expenses associated with one closed mine. Our NAPP segment produces primarily thermal coal, however, we are also able to sell part of our Cumberland coal production (0.7 and 0.2 million tons for the years ended 2018 and 2017, respectively) into the met coal market as High-Vol. B, achieving higher realized pricing than if sold as thermal coal. The Trading and Logistics segment focuses primarily on coal trading and coal terminal facility services. Our All Other category includes general corporate overhead and corporate assets and liabilities and the elimination of certain intercompany activity.\nFinancing Activities\n(1) Total Leverage Ratio is calculated as the ratio of (i) Consolidated Net Total Debt on such date to (ii) Consolidated EBITDA (capitalized terms as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) for the period of the four consecutive fiscal quarters ending as of the date of the financial statements most recently delivered.\n \u2022 Market Conventions. Coal sales contracts are priced according to conventions specific to the market into which such coal is to be sold. Our domestic sales contracts are typically priced free on board ( FOB\u201d) at our mines and on a short ton basis. Our international sales contracts are typically priced FOB at the shipping port from which such coal is delivered and on a metric ton basis. Accordingly, for international sales contracts, we typically bear the cost of transportation from our mines to the applicable outbound shipping port, and our coal sales realization per ton calculation reflects the conversion of such tonnage from metric tons into short tons, as well as the elimination of the freight and handling fulfillment component of coal sales revenue. In addition, for domestic sales contracts, as customers typically bear the cost of transportation from our mines, our operations located further away from the end user of the coal may command lower prices. \n(1) The cost impact of the coal inventory fair value adjustment as a result of the Alpha Merger is expected to have short-term impact.\nOverview\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of acquired companies. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is tested for impairment annually as of October 31 of each year, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist.\nThe calculation of Consolidated EBITDA is based on our results of operations in accordance with the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and therefore, is different from Adjusted EBITDA presented elsewhere in this report. The calculation of Consolidated EBITDA for purposes of the Excess Cash Flow calculation is performed at the end of each fiscal quarter (commencing with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2019).\nOther revenues. Other revenues were $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $0.2 million, or 2.3%, compared to the prior year period, primarily attributable to a $2.0 million increase in coal royalty revenues and a $0.5 million increase in terminal revenues, partially offset by a $2.2 million decrease in rail transportation rebates.\namortization of debt issuance costs and accretion of debt discount, mark-to-market adjustments for acquisition related obligations, equity loss in affiliates, accretion on asset retirement obligations, employee benefit plans, deferred income taxes, loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on disposals, and changes in net working capital.\nLoss on modification and extinguishment of debt. The loss on modification and extinguishment of debt of $12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily related to the write-off of certain outstanding debt discounts, debt issuance costs and debt fees incurred in connection with the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement entered into by the Company on November 9, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017 the Company incurred a loss on modification and extinguishment of debt of $38.7 million, primarily related to a prepayment premium of $22.5 million on the 10.00% Senior Secured First Lien Notes and the write-off of outstanding debt discounts of $13.4 million on the 10.00% Senior Secured First Lien Notes and GUC Distribution Note in connection with the Credit Agreement entered into by the Company on March 17, 2017.\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions, including the current economic environment that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and adjust such estimates and assumptions as facts and circumstances require. Foreign currency and energy markets, and fluctuations in demand for steel products have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in these estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.\n\n(2) % of Excess Cash Flow is reduced by voluntary repayments of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as defined within the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nRetirement Plans. We have three non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans (the Pension Plans\u201d) covering certain of our salaried and non-union hourly employees, all of which are frozen. Benefits are based on either the employee's compensation prior to retirement or stated amounts for each year of service with us. Funding of the Pension Plans is in accordance with requirements of ERISA, and our contributions can be deducted for federal income tax purposes. We contributed $0 to our Pension Plans for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a net periodic benefit credit of $0.3 million for our Pension Plans and have recorded net obligations of $180.8 million.\nRevenues\n (2) Coal margin per ton for our reportable segments is calculated as coal sales realization per ton for our reportable segments less cost of coal sales per ton for our reportable segments. Coal margin per ton is not shown for our All Other category since it has no coal sales or coal production related to our continuing operations. \nFormation\n(1) Our Adjusted EBITDA calculation has been modified to add back non-cash stock compensation expense and accretion on asset retirement obligations, a non-cash expense, to align with industry peer group methodology.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016 was $77.0 million and was primarily attributed to net loss of $67.2 million adjusted for depreciation, depletion and amortization of $85.4 million, amortization of acquired intangibles, net of $11.6 million, and deferred income taxes of $34.9 million. The change in our operating assets and liabilities of $46.6 million was primarily attributed to decreases in trade accounts receivable of $42.8 million and decreases in inventories, net of $16.7 million, partially offset by decreases in other non-current liabilities of $15.6 million.\nOn December 8, 2017, we closed a transaction with Blackjewel L.L.C. ( Buyer\u201d) to sell the Eagle Butte and Belle Ayr mines located in the Power River Basin ( PRB\u201d). During the permit transfer period, we will maintain the required reclamation bonds and related collateral. As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding surety bonds with a total face amount of $237.2 million to secure various obligations and commitments related to the PRB. A citizens' organization filed objections to the permit transfer with the Wyoming Environmental Quality Council on November 16, 2018. The objections are scheduled to be heard on May 15 and 16, 2019. We believe the objections are without merit. Once the permits have been transferred, we estimate approximately $12.6 million comprised of short-term restricted cash and short-term deposits will be returned to operating cash. If the permit transfer process is not completed as expected, it could have material, adverse effects on us.\nof met coal from our Trading and Logistics business, and 6.7 million tons of thermal coal from CAPP - Met and NAPP. During the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016, we sold 1.6 million tons of met coal from CAPP - Met and NAPP, 1.5 million tons of met coal from our Trading and Logistics business, and 2.7 million tons of thermal coal from CAPP - Met and NAPP. During the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016, we sold 2.4 million tons of met coal from CAPP - Met and NAPP, 0.2 million tons of met coal from our Trading and Logistics business, and 4.4 million tons of thermal coal from CAPP - Met and NAPP.\nThe following tables summarize certain financial information relating to our operating results that have been derived from our consolidated financial statements for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016. Also included is certain information relating to the operating results as a percentage of total revenues.\nAsset impairment and restructuring expenses of $3.1 million for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016 consisted of $2.1 million of losses related to non-core property divestitures and $1.0 million related to severance expenses and other restructuring-related charges.\nPer terms of the Back-to-Back Coal Supply Agreements, we are required to purchase and sell coal in 2019 and 2020 totaling $16.1 million and $9.2 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we purchased and sold 5.7 million tons, totaling $62.1 million, under the Back-to-Back Coal Supply Agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we purchased and sold 2.0 million tons, totaling $21.7 million, under the Back-to-Back Coal Supply Agreements.\nThe discussion below contains non-GAAP financial measures.\u201d These are financial measures which either exclude or include amounts that are not excluded or included in the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). Specifically, we make use of the non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted EBITDA\u201d and Adjusted Cost of Produced Coal Sold.\u201d Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to be an alternative to net income (loss) as a measure of operating performance. The presentation of these measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.\nThe income approach is dependent upon a number of significant management estimates about future performance including sales volumes and prices, costs to produce, income taxes, capital spending, working capital changes and the after-tax weighted average cost of capital. Changes in any of these assumptions could materially impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units. Our forecasts of coal prices generally reflect a long-term outlook of market prices expected to be received for\nRevenues \nBusiness Developments\nResults of Operations\nThe major components of cash flows related to our discontinued operations are as follows:\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016 was $21.5 million and was primarily attributed to net loss of $10.9 million adjusted for depreciation, depletion and amortization of $44.0 million, amortization of acquired intangibles, net of $61.3 million, and mark-to-market adjustment for warrants derivative liability of $34.0 million, partially offset by a gain on mark-to-market adjustment for acquisition-related obligations of $10.6 million. The change in our operating assets and liabilities of ($111.5) million was primarily attributed to increases in trade accounts receivable of $114.2 million, increases in inventories, net of $32.0 million and increases in deposits of $55.4 million, partially offset by increases in trade accounts payable of $59.2 million and increases in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $51.1 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $158.4 million and was primarily attributable to net income of $299.2 million adjusted for depreciation, depletion and amortization of $77.5 million, employee benefit plans, net of $9.2 million, accretion on asset retirement obligations of $10.0 million, loss on modification and extinguishment of debt of $12.0 million and stock-based compensation of $13.4 million, partially offset by a $16.9 million gain on disposal of assets and changes in deferred income taxes of $66.7 million. The change in our operating assets and liabilities of ($191.3) million was primarily attributed to increases in trade accounts receivable of $84.1 million, increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $44.3 million, increases in other non-current assets of $36.7 million, decreases in acquisition-related obligations of $14.5 million, and decreases in other non-current liabilities of $19.9 million, partially offset by decreases in inventories, net of $33.2 million.\nSales Agreements\nPeriod from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016 (Predecessor)\nTo secure our obligations under certain worker's compensation, black lung, reclamation-related obligations, general liabilities, and financial guarantees, we are required to provide cash collateral. At December 31, 2018, we had cash collateral in the amounts of $243.6 million, $24.0 million, and $29.1 million classified as short-term and long-term restricted cash, short-term and long-term deposits, and long-term restricted investments, respectively, on our balance sheet.\n(1) Coal margin per ton is calculated as coal sales realization per ton less cost of coal sales per ton.\nAsset Impairment. U.S. GAAP requires that a long-lived asset group that is held and used should be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset group might not be recoverable. Testing long-lived assets for impairment after indicators of impairment have been identified is a two-step process. Step one compares the net undiscounted cash flows of an asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value of an asset group exceeds the net undiscounted cash flows of that asset group, step two is performed whereby the fair value of the asset group is estimated and compared to its carrying amount. The amount of impairment, if any, is equal to the excess of the carrying value of an asset group over its estimated fair value. The amount of impairment, if any, is allocated to the long-lived assets on a pro-rata basis, except that the carrying value of the individual long-lived assets are not reduced below their estimated fair value. Long-lived assets located in a close geographic area are grouped together for purposes of impairment testing when, after considering revenue and cost interdependencies, circumstances indicate the assets are used together to produce future cash flows. Our asset groups generally consist of the assets and applicable liabilities of one or more mines and preparation plants and associated coal reserves for which cash flows are largely independent of cash flows of other mines, preparation plants and associated reserves.\nThe valuation methodology utilized to estimate the fair value of the reporting units is based on both a market and income approach and is within the range of fair values yielded under each approach. The income approach is based on a discounted cash flow methodology in which expected future net cash flows are discounted to present value, using an appropriate after-tax weighted average cost of capital (discount rate). The market approach is based on a guideline company and similar transaction methodology. Under the guideline company approach, certain metrics from a selected group of publicly traded guideline companies that have similar operations to the Company's reporting units are used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units. Under the similar transactions approach, recent merger and acquisition transactions for companies that have similar operations to the Company's reporting units are used to estimate the fair value of the Company's reporting units.\n(5) Includes an estimated $70.9 million in 2019 related to contractually committed variable priced tons from vendors with historical performance resulting in less than 20% of the committed tonnage being delivered.\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016 was $108.4 million, primarily driven by cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash acquired in the Acquisition of $143.8 million partially offset by capital expenditures of $34.5 million and capital contributions to equity affiliates of $2.7 million.\nTrading and Logistics operations. Adjusted EBITDA was $39.3 million for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016, driven by coal margin per ton of $26.84, coal sales realization per ton of $106.96 and cost of coal sales per ton of $80.12.\nCost of coal sales was $305.3 million, freight and handling costs were $52.1 million, other expenses were $2.2 million, depreciation, depletion and amortization was $66.1 million, accretion on asset retirement obligations was $5.0 million, amortization of acquired intangibles, net was $11.6 million and selling, general and administrative expenses were $29.6 million for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016.\nCash Flows\nReorganization items, net of $21.0 million for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016 primarily consisted of realized gains and losses from the settlement of pre-petition liabilities, professional fees, and provisions for losses resulting from Predecessor Alpha's Restructuring.\nOur primary liquidity and capital resource requirements stem from the cost of our coal production and purchases, our capital expenditures, our debt service, our reclamation obligations, our regulatory costs and settlements and associated costs. Our primary sources of liquidity are derived from sales of coal, our debt financing and miscellaneous revenues.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nContractual Obligations\nWe expect to spend between $170 million and $190 million on capital expenditures during 2019.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable segments is a non-GAAP financial measure. This non-GAAP financial measure is presented as a supplemental measure and is not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, this measure is not calculated identically by all companies and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is presented because ANR's management believes it is a useful indicator of the financial performance of our coal operations. The following table presents a reconciliation of net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016:\nUpon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, our common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker CTRA.\u201d Previously, our shares traded on the OTC market under the ticker CNTE.\u201d\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n (2) Coal margin per ton for our reportable segments is calculated as coal sales realization per ton for our reportable segments less cost of coal sales per ton for our reportable segments. Coal margin per ton is not shown for our All Other category since it has no coal sales or coal production related to our continuing operations. \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\n\nExcess Cash Flow is calculated in accordance with our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and is equal to (i) the sum, without duplication, of Consolidated Net Income, the aggregate amount of all non-cash charges, the amount of the decrease, if any, in Consolidated Working Capital and the amount of non-cash losses on the disposition of property to the extent deducted in arriving at Consolidated Net Income minus (ii) the sum, without duplication, of the amount of all non-cash credits included in arriving at Consolidated Net Income, certain capital expenditures, certain amounts of regularly scheduled principal payments of Indebtedness made in cash, the amount of the increase, if any, in Consolidated Working Capital and the aggregate amount of non-cash gains on the disposition of property to the extent included in arriving at Consolidated Net Income.\nOur management strives to aggressively control costs and improve operating performance to mitigate external cost pressures. We experience volatility in operating costs related to fuel, explosives, steel, tires, contract services and healthcare, among others, and take measures to mitigate the increases in these costs at all operations. We have a centralized sourcing group for major supplier contract negotiation and administration, for the negotiation and purchase of major capital goods, and to support the business units. We promote competition between suppliers and seek to develop relationships with suppliers that focus on lowering our costs. We seek suppliers who identify and concentrate on implementing continuous improvement opportunities within their area of expertise. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. We may also experience difficult geologic conditions, delays in obtaining permits, labor shortages, unforeseen equipment problems, and unexpected shortages of critical materials such as tires, fuel and explosives that may result in adverse cost increases and limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels.\nIn the event that there shall be Excess Cash Flow for any fiscal quarter commencing with the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2019, pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we will, no later than 70 days after the end of such fiscal quarter (or 130 days in the case of the last fiscal quarter of any fiscal year), prepay the loan amounts under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, based on the Total Leverage Ratio as follows:\nNet cash flows from operating activities consist of net income adjusted for non-cash items, such as depreciation, depletion and amortization, amortization of acquired intangibles, net, accretion and settlement of acquisition-related obligations discount,\nThe following tables summarize certain financial information relating to our operating results that have been derived from our combined financial statements for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016. Also included is certain information relating to the operating results as a percentage of total revenues.\n\nAs a regular part of our business, we review opportunities for, and engage in discussions and negotiations concerning, the acquisition or disposition of coal mining and related infrastructure assets and interests in coal mining companies, and acquisitions or dispositions of, or combinations or other strategic transactions involving companies with coal mining or other energy assets. When we believe that these opportunities are consistent with our strategic plans and our acquisition or disposition criteria, we will make bids or proposals and/or enter into letters of intent and other similar agreements. These bids or proposals, which may be binding or non-binding, are customarily subject to a variety of conditions and usually permit us to terminate the discussions and any related agreement if, among other things, we are not satisfied with the results of due diligence. Any acquisition opportunities we pursue could materially affect our liquidity and capital resources and may require us to incur indebtedness, seek equity capital or both. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $170.3 million, primarily attributable to principal repayments of debt of $369.5 million, special dividend paid of $100.7 million, debt extinguishment costs of $25.0 million, debt issuance costs of $14.4 million, and common stock repurchases and related expenses of $49.9 million, partially offset by borrowings on debt of $396.0 million.\n(2) Does not include $363.1 million of freight and handling fulfillment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\n \u2022 Coal Quality. The energy content or heat value of thermal coal is a significant factor influencing coal prices as higher energy coal is more desirable to consumers and typically commands a higher price in the market. The heat value of coal is commonly measured in British thermal units or the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. Coal from the eastern and midwest regions of the United States tends to have a higher heat value than coal found in the western United States. Coal volatility is a significant factor influencing met coal pricing as coal with a lower volatility has historically been more highly valued and typically commands a higher price in the market. The volatility refers to the loss in mass, less moisture, when coal is heated in the absence of air. The volatility of met coal determines the percentage of feed coal that actually becomes coke, known as coke yield, with lower volatility producing a higher coke yield. \nSale of PRB Operations\nIncluded below are reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures.\n (1) Our Adjusted EBITDA calculation has been modified to add back non-cash stock compensation expense and accretion on asset retirement obligations, a non-cash expense, to align with industry peer group methodology. \nThe mark-to-market gain on acquisition-related obligations of $10.6 million for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016 consisted of a mark-to-market gain of $17.4 million related to the Contingent Credit Support Commitment and a mark-to-market loss of $6.8 million related to the Contingent Reclamation Funding Liability.\n \u2022 The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is an assumption of the rate of return on plan assets reflecting the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. We establish the expected long-term rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon historical returns and projected returns on the underlying mix of invested assets. The Pension Plans investment targets are 40% equity securities and 60% debt securities. Investments are rebalanced on a periodic basis to stay within these targeted guidelines. The long-term rate of return assumption used to determine net periodic benefit expense was 5.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The long-term rate of return assumption to be used in 2019 is expected to be 5.8%. Any difference between the actual experience and the assumed experience is deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss and amortized into expense in future periods. \nContura was incorporated in the State of Delaware on June 10, 2016 to acquire and operate certain of Alpha's core coal operations, as part of the Alpha Restructuring. On July 26, 2016, a consortium of former Alpha creditors acquired our common stock in exchange for a partial release of their creditor claims pursuant to the Alpha Restructuring. Furthermore, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement between Contura and Alpha, we purchased certain former core coal operations of Alpha.\nWe meet frequently with our surety providers and have discussions with certain providers regarding the extent of and the terms of their participation in the program. These discussions may cause us to shift surety bonds between providers or to alter the terms of their participation in our program. To the extent that surety bonds become unavailable or our surety bond providers require additional collateral, we would seek to secure our obligations with letters of credit, cash deposits or other suitable forms of collateral. Our failure to maintain, or inability to acquire, surety bonds or to provide a suitable alternative would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. These failures could result from a variety of factors including lack of availability, higher cost or unfavorable market terms of new surety bonds, and the exercise by third-party surety bond issuers of their right to refuse to renew the surety.\n(2) Pursuant to the PRB divestiture and classification as a discontinued operation, we are no longer presenting a PRB reporting segment. The former PRB reporting segment had Adjusted EBITDA of $41.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable segments is a non-GAAP financial measure. This non-GAAP financial measure is presented as a supplemental measure and is not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, this measure is not calculated identically by all companies and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is presented because ANR's management believes it is a useful indicator of the financial performance of our coal operations. The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016:\nThe following discussion and analysis provides a narrative of our results of operations and financial condition for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (Successor), the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016 (Successor), and the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016 (Predecessor). The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes and the risk factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNAPP operations. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $10.1 million, or 18.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to decreased coal margin per ton of $0.89. The decrease in coal margin per ton consisted of increased average cost of coal sales per ton of $2.00, or approximately 5.5%, due primarily to reductions in tons sold due to geological factors during the current period.\nCost of coal sales. Cost of coal sales increased $218.1 million, or 20.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by increased purchases of tons associated with our Trading and Logistics operations segment, increased labor costs, and increased repair and maintenance activities during the current period.\n\nPursuant to the Amended and Restated Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement, during any Liquidity Period (capitalized terms as defined in the Amended and Restated Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement), our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio cannot be less than 1.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of any Test Period, commencing with the Test Period ended immediately preceding the commencement of such Liquidity Period. The Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is calculated as (a) Consolidated EBITDA of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries for such period, minus non-financed Capital Expenditures (including Capital Expenditures financed with the proceeds of any Loans) paid or payable currently in cash by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for such period to (b) the Fixed Charges of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries during such period. As of April 1, 2019, we were not in a Liquidity Period.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016 was $41.5 million, primarily attributable to $42.5 million of proceeds from borrowings on debt.\nOther\nContingent Revenue Obligation. Our contingent revenue obligation was assumed in connection with the Merger. Determining the fair value of this obligation requires management's judgment and the utilization of independent valuation experts, and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to forecasts of future revenues, revenue volatility, and discount rates. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual payments made under the obligation could differ materially from our current estimates. For a further discussion of the factors that could result in a change in our assumptions, see Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016 was $35.8 million, primarily attributable to transfers to Alpha.\nAcquisition-related obligations. For the year ended December 31, 2018 the Company recorded a mark-to-market loss on acquisition-related obligations of $24 thousand related to the Contingent Revenue Obligation. The mark-to-market loss on acquisition-related obligations of $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily consisted of a mark-to-market loss of $2.5 million related to the Contingent Reclamation Funding Liability and a mark-to-market loss of $0.7 million related to the Contingent Credit Support Commitment. The gain on settlement of acquisition-related obligations of $38.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily consisted of the UMWA Contingent VEBA Funding Notes 1 and Note 2 settlements.\nAcquisition-Related Obligations\nAll Other category. Adjusted EBITDA was ($18.0) million for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016, primarily driven by wages and benefits expense of $7.4 million, professional fees of $4.0 million, incentive pay of $3.2 million, and rent, utilities and property costs of $0.6 million\nNAPP operations. Adjusted EBITDA was $28.2 million for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016, driven by coal margin per ton of $8.87, coal sales realization per ton of $45.00 and cost of coal sales per ton of $36.13.\nAll Other category. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $3.3 million, or 8.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by increases in incentive pay and severance related expenses during the current period.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had total liquidity of $429.9 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $233.6 million and $196.3 million of unused commitments available under the Amended and Restated Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement, subject to limitations described therein. On November 9, 2018, we entered into a $550.0 million term loan credit facility under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with a maturity date of November 9, 2025, and a $225.0 million asset-based revolving credit facility under the Amended and Restated Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement expiring on April 3, 2022. Refer to Note 15 for disclosures on long-term debt.\ncharges permitted to be added back pursuant to this clause (iv) for a four-quarter period shall not exceed 20% of Consolidated EBITDA for such period (calculated before giving effect to such add-back); (v) any expenses, costs or charges related to any equity offering, Investment permitted, acquisition, disposition, recapitalization or Indebtedness permitted to be incurred by the indenture (whether or not successful); (vi) all non-recurring or unusual losses, charges and expenses (and less all non-recurring or unusual gains); (vii) all non-cash charges and expenses; (viii) any debt extinguishment costs; (ix) any amount of asset retirement obligations expenses; (x) all Transaction Costs incurred in connection with the Transactions contemplated hereby; (xi) transaction costs, fees and expenses incurred during such period in connection with any acquisition or disposition not prohibited hereunder or any issuance of debt or equity securities by the surviving Parent, the Borrowers or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case, for such expenses; and (xii) commissions, premiums, discounts, fees or other charges relating to performance bonds, bid bonds, appeal bonds, surety bonds, wage bonds, bonds issued in favor of any Governmental Authority, reclamation and completion guarantees and other similar obligations; provided that, with respect to any Restricted Subsidiary, such items will be added only to the extent and in the same proportion that the relevant Restricted Subsidiary's net income was included in calculating Consolidated Net Income.\neffects of the PRB operations being reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 4 for further information on discontinued operations. The Merger with Alpha Natural Resources Holdings, Inc. and ANR, Inc. was completed on November 9, 2018. Refer to Note 3 for information on terms of the Merger Agreement.\n(1) Management restructuring costs are related to severance expense associated with senior management changes in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIn addition, our cost of coal sales includes idle and closed mine costs and purchased coal costs. Additionally due to the Merger, our cost of coal sales includes the cost impact of coal inventory fair value adjustments. In the following table, we calculate adjusted cost of produced coal sold as cost of coal sales less idle and closed mine costs, cost impact of coal inventory fair value adjustments and purchased coal costs.\nTrading and Logistics operations. Adjusted EBITDA was ($1.2) million for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016, driven by coal margin per ton of $5.63, coal sales realization per ton of $54.64 and cost of coal sales per ton of $49.01.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017 (Successor)\nassumptions and return on plan assets to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could affect our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. As of December 31, 2018, we had estimated black lung obligations of approximately $92.2 million, including amounts reported as current and $94 thousand related to discontinued operations, which are net of assets of $2.6 million that are held in a tax-exempt trust fund.\n\nIncome tax benefit of $39.9 million was recorded for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016 on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $101.4 million. The income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the impact of the percentage depletion allowance and state income taxes, net of federal tax impact, partially offset by the impact of the non-deductible transaction costs. See Note 21 for additional information.\nwith GAAP. Moreover, this measure is not calculated identically by all companies and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is presented because management believes it is a useful indicator of the financial performance of our coal operations. The following tables presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $102.2 million, primarily driven by cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash acquired in acquisition, net of amounts paid of $198.5 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $81.9 million, payments on disposition of assets of $10.3 million, and capital contributions to equity affiliates of $5.3 million.\n\n\nCosts and Expenses\nMet coal volumes increased 2.2 million tons due to increased export sales during the current period, and average coal realization per ton decreased $0.05. Thermal coal volumes decreased 0.3 million tons due to increased longwall moves and geological factors during the current period, and average coal realization per ton increased $0.62. The increase in coal revenues consisted of increased met coal revenue of $272.9 million, or 24.7%, partially offset by decreased thermal coal revenue of $7.6 million, or 2.7%.\n (1) Does not include any portion of the price paid by our export customers to transport coal to the relevant outbound shipping port. \n(2) Includes capital lease obligation principal amounts of $2.1 million in 2019, $1.5 million in 2020, $1.6 million in 2021, and $1.2 million in 2022. Cash interest payable on these obligations with interest rates ranging between 0.39% and 9.50%, would be approximately $0.2 million in 2019, $0.1 million in 2020, $0.1 million in 2021, and $16 thousand in 2022. Other debt includes principal amounts of $0.6 million in 2019, $0.7 million in 2020, $0.6 million in 2021, and $32 thousand in 2022.\nCoal revenues. Coal revenues increased $265.3 million, or 19.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. The increase in coal revenues was due primarily to increased revenues of 41.5% and 9.5% for CAPP - Met and our Trading and Logistics operations, respectively, and the addition of revenues from the CAPP - Thermal operations during the current year period, partially offset by decreased revenues of 6.8% for NAPP.\nBlackjewel's performance obligations are also collateralized by a security interest in mobile equipment granted to Contura under 8.6(c) of the Asset Purchase Agreement. Further, in connection with this arrangement, approximately $8.0 million in surety cash collateral previously supporting reclamation bonds was returned to Contura by certain of its sureties.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $22.7 million, primarily attributable to net proceeds from borrowings on debt of $537.8 million, partially offset by principal repayments of debt of $471.7 million, common stock repurchases and related expenses of $20.3 million, debt issuance costs of $14.9 million, form S-4 costs of $3.9 million, and principal repayments of notes payable of $3.8 million.\nIncome tax benefit of $68.0 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 on income from continuing operations before income taxes of $105.8 million. The effective tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the impact of the percentage depletion allowance and the reduction in the valuation allowance, partially offset by the revaluation of the net deferred tax assets as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See Note 21 for additional information.\nLong-Term Debt\nadditional bank credit facilities. The sale of equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of additional indebtedness could result in increased fixed obligations and additional covenants that could restrict our operations.\n\n\n \u2022 Third-Party Margin. The measurement of an obligation at fair value is based upon the amount a third-party would demand to perform the obligation. Because we plan to perform a significant amount of the reclamation activities with internal resources, a third-party margin was added to the estimated costs of these activities. This margin was estimated based upon our historical experience with contractors performing similar types of reclamation activities. The inclusion of this margin will result in a recorded obligation that is greater than our estimates of our cost to perform the reclamation activities. If our cost estimates are accurate, the excess of the recorded obligation over the cost incurred to perform the work will be recorded within depreciation, depletion and amortization within our Consolidated Statements of Operations at the time that reclamation work is completed.  On at least an annual basis, we review our reclamation liabilities and make necessary adjustments for permit changes as granted by state authorities, additional costs resulting from accelerated mine closures, and revisions to cost estimates and productivity assumptions, to reflect current experience and updated plans. At December 31, 2018, we had recorded asset retirement obligation liabilities of $228.4 million, including amounts reported as current, and $1.4 million asset retirement obligations liabilities classified as held for sale. While the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with certainty, as of December 31, 2018, we estimate that the aggregate undiscounted cost of final mine closures is approximately $619.2 million.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $42.6 million, or 122.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. The increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization primarily related to increased purchases of machinery and equipment, increased asset development during the current period, and additions of property, plant and equipment as a result of the Merger.\n (1) Cost of coal sales per ton exclude costs associated with our All Other category. \nWe sponsor three qualified non-contributory pension plans ( Pension Plans\u201d) which cover certain salaried and non-union hourly employees. Participants accrued benefits either based on certain formulas, the participant's compensation prior to retirement or plan specified amounts for each year of service. Benefits are frozen under these Pension Plans. Annual funding contributions to the Pension Plans are made as recommended by consulting actuaries based upon the ERISA funding standards. Funding decisions also consider certain funded status thresholds defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. We expect to contribute $6.4 million to the Pension Plans in 2019. See Note 22 for further disclosures related to this obligation.\nContura agreed to backstop a total of $44.8 million of Blackjewel's bonding obligations with respect to the Belle Ayr and Eagle Butte permits by entering into secondary general indemnification agreements and providing letters of credit totaling $18.8 million to the sureties as collateral for Contura's indemnification obligations. This arrangement provides cost reimbursement for the issuing sureties. Indemnity bonds were issued by a third-party insurer in favor of Contura in a total amount of $26.0 million to insure Blackjewel's performance obligations to Contura with respect to cancellation of the general indemnification agreements and return of the letters of credit.\nIn addition, we generate other revenues from equipment sales, rentals, terminal and processing fees, coal and environmental analysis fees, royalties and the sale of natural gas. We also record freight and handling fulfillment revenue within coal revenues for freight and handling services provided in delivering coal to certain customers, which are a component of the contractual selling price.\nCAPP - Met operations. Adjusted EBITDA increased $61.4 million, or 35.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by increased average sales realization per ton of $7.30, or approximately 6.2%, due primarily to increases in the market pricing of coal during the current period and increased sales volumes.\nOur sales mix of met coal and thermal coal based on volume was 63.2% and 36.8%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 56.9% and 43.1%, respectively, in the prior year period. Our sales mix of met coal and thermal coal based on coal revenues, excluding freight and handling fulfillment revenues, was 83.2% and 16.8%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 79.4% and 20.6%, respectively, for the prior year period.\n(3) See Note 16 for further disclosures related to this obligation.\n(1) Includes Term Loan Credit Facility principal amounts of $27.5 million in 2019, $27.5 million in 2020, $27.5 million in 2021, $27.5 million in 2022, $27.5 million in 2023, and $412.5 million after 2023. Cash interest payable on this obligation, with an interest rate of 7.39%, would be approximately $40.4 million in 2019, $38.5 million in 2020, $36.3 million in 2021, $34.2 million in 2022, $32.2 million in 2023, and $54.4 million after 2023. Also includes Lexington Coal Company ( LCC\u201d) Note Payable principal amounts of $17.5 million in 2019, $17.5 million in 2020, $17.5 million in 2021, and $10.0 million in 2022 and LCC Water Treatment Stipulation principal amounts of $1.9 million in 2019, $2.5 million in 2020, $2.5 million in 2021, $2.5 million in 2022, and $2.5 million in 2023.\nOther (income) expense. Other (income) expense decreased $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. This decrease primarily related to the gain on disposal of assets of $16.9 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the sale of a disposal group within the Company's CAPP - Met segment.\n\nBlackjewel agreed that, by June 30, 2019, it will (i) enter into financing arrangements of $44.8 million to be held as collateral by the sureties and (ii) cause each surety to release and return each letter of credit and cancel the Contura general indemnification agreements.\nThe increase in CAPP - Met revenues was primarily due to higher coal sales volume of 1.3 million tons and increases in coal sales realization of $7.30 per ton. CAPP - Thermal revenues consisted of 0.6 million tons sold at a coal sales realization of $56.46 per ton. The decrease in NAPP revenues was primarily due to lower coal sales volumes of 0.6 million tons, partially offset by higher coal sales realization of $1.11 per ton. The increase in Trading and Logistics coal revenues was primarily due to higher sales volumes of 0.6 million tons, partially offset by lower coal sales realization of $4.12 per ton.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe are required to provide financial assurance in order to perform the post-mining reclamation required by our mining permits, pay our federal production royalties, pay workers' compensation claims under workers' compensation laws in various states, pay federal black lung benefits, and perform certain other obligations. In order to provide the required financial assurance, we generally use surety bonds for post-mining reclamation and workers' compensation obligations. We can also use bank letters of credit to collateralize certain obligations.\nFactors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nOur results of operations for the Successor period for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are discussed in these Results of Operations\u201d presented below. Given the change in basis that resulted from the Acquisition on July 26, 2016, we separately discuss our Successor and Predecessor results of operations and segment results for the results of operations for 2016.\nManagement uses non-GAAP financial measures to supplement GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the presentations of these measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and can differ significantly from company to company depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate, and capital investments.\n\nAnalysis of Material Debt Covenants\n (2) Pursuant to the PRB divestiture and classification as a discontinued operation, we are no longer presenting a PRB reporting segment. The former PRB reporting segment had adjusted EBITDA of $45.8 million for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016. \nFreight and handling fulfillment revenues were $363.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $115.7 million, or 46.8%, compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to increased shipments by rail car and increased shipping rates during the current period.\nour coal. However, coal prices are influenced by global market conditions beyond our control. If actual coal prices are less than our expectations, it could have a material impact on the fair value of our reporting units. Our forecasts of costs to produce coal are based on our operating forecasts and an assumed inflation rate for materials and supplies such as steel, diesel fuel and explosives. However, the costs of the materials and supplies used in our production process such as steel, diesel fuel and explosives are influenced by global market conditions beyond our control. If actual costs are higher or if inflation increases above our expectations, it could have a material impact on the fair value of our reporting units. We also are faced with increasingly stringent safety standards and governmental regulation, much of which is beyond our control, which could increase our costs and materially decrease the fair value of our reporting units. For a further discussion of the factors that could result in a change in our assumptions, see Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nBusiness Combinations. We account for our business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying identifiable net tangible and intangible assets based on their respective estimated fair values. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment, the utilization of independent valuation experts and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, market prices and asset lives, among other items.\n (1) Cost of coal sales per ton exclude costs associated with our All Other category. \n(1) Coal margin per ton for our reportable segments is calculated as coal sales realization per ton for our reportable segments less cost of coal sales per ton for our reportable segments. Coal margin per ton is not shown for our All Other category since it has no coal sales or coal production related to our continuing operations.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $314.3 million and was primarily attributed to net income of $154.5 million adjusted for depreciation, depletion and amortization of $65.0 million, amortization of acquired intangibles, net of $59.0 million, accretion on asset retirement obligations of $21.3 million, loss on sale of Powder River Basin of $36.1 million, stock based compensation of $20.4 million, and loss on modification and extinguishment of debt of $38.7 million, partially offset by a $38.9 million gain on settlement of acquisition-related obligations and changes in deferred income taxes of $78.7 million. The change in our operating assets and liabilities of $9.8 million was primarily attributed to decreases in trade accounts receivable, net of $34.8 million, decreases in deposits of $38.4 million, and decreases in other non-current assets of $24.5 million, partially offset by increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $40.4 million, decreases in acquisition-related obligations of $22.8 million, and decreases in other non-current liabilities of $16.5 million.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\n(2) During the fourth quarter of 2017, we entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell a disposal group (comprised of property, plant and equipment and associated asset retirement obligations) within our CAPP - Met segment. From the date we entered into the asset purchase agreement through the transaction close date, the property, plant and equipment and associated asset retirement obligations were classified as held for sale in amounts representing the fair value of the disposal group. Upon permit transfer, the transaction closed on April 2, 2018. We paid $10.0 million in connection with the transaction, which was paid into escrow on March 27, 2018 and transferred to the buyer at the transaction close date, and expect to pay a series of additional cash payments in the aggregate amount of $1.5 million, per the terms stated in the agreement, and recorded a gain on sale of approximately $16.4 million within other (income) expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n\nCAPP - Met operations. Adjusted EBITDA was $0.6 million for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016, driven by coal margin per ton of $0.86, coal sales realization per ton of $60.14 and cost of coal sales per ton of $59.28.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nTotal revenues. Total revenues increased $381.2 million, or 23.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. The increase in total revenues was due to increased coal revenues of $265.3 million, increased freight and handling fulfillment revenues of $115.7 million and increased other revenues of $0.2 million.\nRevenues\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding surety bonds with a total face amount of $581.4 million to secure various obligations and commitments, including $237.2 million related to the PRB. To secure our reclamation-related obligations, we currently have $137.3 million of collateral supporting these obligations. Once the permits associated with the PRB Transaction have been transferred, the Company estimates approximately $12.6 million comprised of short-term restricted cash and short-term deposits will be returned to operating cash.\n\nThe calculation of the net periodic benefit expense/credit and projected benefit obligation associated with our Pension Plans requires the use of a number of assumptions, which are used by our independent actuaries to make the underlying calculations. Changes in these assumptions can result in different net periodic benefit expense and liability amounts, and actual experience can differ from the assumptions.\n\nWe are a large-scale provider of met and thermal coal to a global customer base, operating high-quality, cost-competitive coal mines across two major U.S. coal basins (CAPP and NAPP) along with a robust Trading and Logistics business. As of December 31, 2018, our operations consisted of thirty-two active mines and twelve coal preparation and load-out facilities, with approximately 4,420 employees. We produce, process, and sell met coal and thermal coal from operations located in Virginia, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. We also sell coal produced by others, some of which is processed and/or blended with coal produced from our mines prior to resale, with the remainder purchased for resale by our trading operations. As of December 31, 2018, we had 1.3 billion tons of reserves, including 885.5 million tons of proven reserves and 462.9 million tons of probable reserves.\nTo secure our obligations under certain worker's compensation, black lung, reclamation-related obligations, general liabilities, and financial guarantees, we are required to provide cash collateral. At December 31, 2018, we had cash collateral in the amounts of $243.6 million, $24.0 million, and $29.1 million classified as short-term and long-term restricted cash, short-term and long-term deposits, and long-term restricted investments, respectively, on our balance sheet. Once the permits associated with the PRB transaction have been transferred, we estimate approximately $12.6 million, comprised of short-term restricted cash and short-term deposits, will be returned to operating cash. If the permit transfer process is not completed as expected, it could have material, adverse effects on us.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements. See Note 2 for disclosures related to new accounting policies adopted.\nConsolidated EBITDA is calculated in accordance with our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and is equal to Consolidated Net Income plus, without duplication (i) consolidated interest expense; (ii) to the extent deducted in computing such Consolidated Net Income, the sum of all income, franchise or similar taxes; (iii) depreciation, depletion, amortization (including, without limitation, amortization of intangibles, deferred financing fees and any amortization included in pension or other employee benefit expenses) and all other non-cash items reducing Consolidated Net Income (including, without limitation, write-downs and impairment of property, plant, equipment and intangibles and other long-lived assets and the impact of acquisition accounting, but excluding, in each case, non-cash charges in a period which reflect cash expenses paid or to be paid in another period); (iv) non-recurring restructuring costs, expenses and charges, including, without limitation, all business optimization costs and expenses, facility opening, pre-opening and closing and consolidation costs and expenses, advisory and professional fees and stay and retention bonuses; provided that the amount of non-recurring restructuring costs, expenses and\nCAPP- Met operations. Adjusted EBITDA was $46.4 million for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016, driven by coal margin per ton of $32.59, coal sales realization per ton of $99.41 and cost of coal sales per ton of $66.82.\n\n \u2022 Regional Supply and Demand. Our realized price per ton is influenced by market forces of the regional market into which such coal is to be sold. Market pricing may vary according to region and lead to different discounts or premiums to the most directly comparable benchmark price for such coal product.  Costs. Our results of operations are dependent upon our ability to improve productivity and control costs. Our primary expenses are for operating supply costs, repair and maintenance expenditures, cost of purchased coal, royalties, current wages and benefits, freight and handling costs and taxes incurred in selling our coal. Principal goods and services we use in our operations include maintenance and repair parts and services, electricity, fuel, roof control and support items, explosives, tires, conveyance structure, ventilation supplies and lubricants.\nConsolidated Net Income is calculated in accordance with our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and is equal to the net income determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding, without duplication, noncash compensation expenses related to common stock and other equity securities issued to employees, extraordinary and non-recurring gains and loss, income or losses from discontinued operations or disposal of discontinued operations or costs and expense associated with the closure of any minds (including any reclamation or disposal obligations), any non-cash impairment charges or asset write-offs resulting from the application of certain ASC standards, net unrealized gains or losses resulting from non-cash foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses, net unrealized gains or losses results in such period from certain derivatives, non-cash charges including non-cash charges due to cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles, any net income or loss of any person that is not a restricted subsidiary or that is accounted for by equity method accounting except to the extent the dividends or similar distributions are paid in cash to the specified person or restricted subsidiary, the net income (but not loss) of any restricted subsidiary to the extent that the declaration or payment of dividends or similar distributions by that restricted subsidiary of that net income is not at the date of determination permitted without any prior governmental approval (that has not been obtained) or, directly or indirectly, by operation of the terms of its charter or any agreement, instrument, judgment, decree, order, statute, rule or governmental regulation applicable to that restricted subsidiary or its stockholders (other than any restriction that has been waived or released), plus, without duplication, any cash dividends and/or distributions actually received by the Company or restricted subsidiary from any unrestricted subsidiary and/or joint venture to the extent not already included therein.\nSee Note 16 for additional details and disclosures on acquisition-related obligations.\nInterest expense of $20.5 million for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016 consisted of the accrued interest on debt instruments and acquisition-related obligations, including discounts, resulting from the Acquisition.\n (2) Pursuant to the PRB divestiture and classification as a discontinued operation, we are no longer presenting a PRB reporting segment. The former PRB reporting segment had adjusted EBITDA of $36.9 million for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016. \nFreight and handling costs. Freight and handling costs increased $115.7 million, or 46.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to increased shipments by rail car and increased shipping rates during the current period.\nMerger with Alpha Natural Resources Holdings, Inc. and ANR, Inc.\nWe began operations on July 26, 2016, with mining operations in NAPP, the PRB, and CAPP. Through the Acquisition, Contura acquired a significant reserve base. We also acquired Alpha's 40.6% interest in the DTA coal export terminal in eastern Virginia, and on March 31, 2017, we acquired a portion of another partner's ownership stake and increased our interest to 65.0%. On December 8, 2017, the Company closed a transaction to sell the Eagle Butte and Belle Ayr mines located in the PRB, Wyoming, along with related coal reserves, equipment, infrastructure and other real properties. The PRB results of operations and financial position are reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The historical information in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements has been restated to reflect the\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n(3) The cost impact of the coal inventory fair value adjustment as a result of the Alpha Merger is expected to have short-term impact.\nReclamation. Our asset retirement obligations arise from the federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 and similar state statutes, which require that mine property be restored in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan. Significant reclamation activities include reclaiming refuse and slurry ponds, reclaiming the pit and support acreage at surface mines, sealing portals at deep mines and the treatment of water. We determine the future cash flows necessary to satisfy our reclamation obligations on a permit-by-permit basis based upon current permit requirements and various estimates and assumptions, including estimates of disturbed acreage, cost estimates, and assumptions regarding productivity. We are also faced with increasingly stringent environmental regulation, much of which is beyond our control, which could increase our costs and materially increase our asset retirement obligations. Estimates of disturbed acreage are determined based on approved mining plans and related engineering data. Cost estimates are based upon third-party costs. Productivity assumptions are based on historical experience with the equipment that is expected to be utilized in the reclamation activities. Our asset retirement obligations are initially recorded at fair value. In order to determine fair value, we use assumptions including a discount rate and third-party margin. Each is discussed further below:\nOur sales of met coal were made primarily to steel companies in the northeastern and midwestern regions of the United States and in several countries in Europe, Asia and the Americas. Our sales of thermal coal were made primarily to large utilities and industrial customers throughout the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016, and the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016 approximately 82.7%, 77.2%, 71.2%, and 39.3%, respectively, of our total coal revenues, including freight and handling revenues, were derived from coal sales made to customers outside the United States.\nSelling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $8.2 million, or 12.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. This decrease in expense was primarily related to decreases of $7.2 million in stock compensation expense and $5.1 million in professional services fees, partially offset by increases of $3.0 million in incentive bonus plans and $2.5 million in severance pay during the current period.\nThe Merger with ANR, Inc. ( ANR\u201d) and Alpha Natural Resources Holdings, Inc. ( Holdings\u201d, and, together with ANR, the \"Alpha Companies\u201d) was completed on November 9, 2018 (the Merger\u201d or the Alpha Merger\u201d). For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Alpha Companies' financial results are included in the Financial Statements for the period from November 9, 2018 through December 31, 2018. The Alpha Companies' financial results are not included in the Financial Statements in periods prior to November 9, 2018. Refer to Note 3 for information on Alpha Merger and terms of the Merger Agreement.\nRealized Pricing. Our realized price per ton of coal is influenced by many factors that vary by region, including (i) coal quality, which includes energy (heat content), sulfur, ash, volatile matter and moisture content; (ii) differences in market conventions concerning transportation costs and volume measurement; and (iii) regional supply and demand.\nThe following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\n \u2022 The discount rate represents our estimate of the interest rate at which pension benefits could be effectively settled. Assumed discount rates are used in the measurement of the projected and accumulated benefit obligations and the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense. In estimating that rate, we use rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments. The weighted average discount rate used to determine pension expense was 4.23% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The differences resulting from actual versus assumed discount rates are amortized into pension expense/credit over the remaining average life of the active plan participants. A one percentage-point increase in the discount rate would increase the net periodic pension cost for the year ended December 31, 2018 by approximately $1.9 million and decrease the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2018 by approximately $88.0 million. The corresponding effects of a one percentage-point decrease in discount rate would decrease the net periodic pension cost for the year ended December 31, 2018 by approximately $2.9 million and increase the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2018 by approximately $111.6 million.  Coal Workers' Pneumoconiosis. We are required by federal and state statues to provide benefits to employees for awards related to coal workers' pneumoconiosis disease (black lung). Certain of our subsidiaries are insured for black lung obligations by a third-party insurance provider. Certain subsidiaries in West Virginia are self-insured for state black lung obligations. Certain other subsidiaries are self-insured for black lung benefits and may fund benefit payments through Section 501(c)(21) tax-exempt trust fund. Provisions are made for estimated benefits based on annual evaluations prepared by independent actuaries. Charges are made to operations for self-insured black lung claims, as determined by an independent actuary at the present value of the actuarially computed liability for such benefits over the employee's applicable term of service. These actuarially determined liabilities use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate, future cost trends, demographic\nTotal revenues were $506.3 million for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016 and consisted of coal revenues of $431.7 million, freight and handling revenues of $70.5 million and other revenues of $4.1 million. Our sales mix of met coal and thermal coal based on volume was 52.8% and 47.2%, respectively, and our sales mix of met coal and thermal coal based on coal revenues was 72.4% and 27.6%, respectively, for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016. Average coal sales realization per ton was $74.34. CAPP - Met, NAPP, and Trading and Logistics operations' coal revenues comprised 27%, 26%, and 32%, respectively, of total revenues for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016.\n(1) The estimated undiscounted cash flows will be paid from the defined benefit pension plan assets held within the defined benefit pension plan trust. See Note 22 for further disclosures related to this obligation.\nIncome tax benefit of $1.9 million was recorded for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016 on loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $13.8 million. The income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the impact of the non-deductible mark-to-market adjustment for the warrant derivative liability, partially offset by the impact of the percentage depletion allowance and the reduction in the valuation allowance. See Note 21 for additional information.\nNAPP operations. Adjusted EBITDA was $35.5 million for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016, driven by coal margin per ton of $7.87, coal sales realization per ton of $43.93 and cost of coal sales per ton of $36.06.\nSales Volume. We earn revenues primarily through the sale of coal produced at our operations and resale of coal purchased from third parties. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold 5.7 million tons of met coal from CAPP - Met, CAPP - Thermal, and NAPP, 5.4 million tons of met coal from our Trading and Logistics business, 6.4 million tons of thermal coal from CAPP - Met, CAPP - Thermal, and NAPP, and 0.1 million tons of thermal coal from our Trading and Logistics business. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold 4.1 million tons of met coal from CAPP - Met and NAPP, 4.8 million tons\n\nThe PRB results of operations and financial position are reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The historical information in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements has been restated to reflect the effects of the PRB operations being reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The discontinued operations include our former PRB segment. To conform with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes, the former PRB segment information for the discontinued operation has been eliminated. See Note 4 for further information on discontinued operations. The following tables summarize certain financial information relating to the PRB discontinued operating results that have been derived from our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016, and the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016.\nInvesting Activities\nOn November 9, 2018, Contura, along with the Alpha Companies, completed the Merger in which the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding Class C-1 shares of ANR and the 100% of the outstanding shares of Holdings. Prior to the closing of the transaction, the Alpha Companies stockholders also received a special cash dividend (the Dividend\u201d). Refer to Note 3 for additional disclosures surrounding these amounts. Additionally, on November 6, 2018, Contura, the Alpha Companies and the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (the WVDEP\u201d) entered into a binding term sheet agreement to resolve certain issues related to the issuance of the Dividend under the Permitting and Reclamation Plan Settlement Agreement for the State of West Virginia dated as of July 12, 2016. The agreement, among other things, required the posting of collateral to secure Contura's and ANR's payment obligations under the Amended Reclamation Funding Agreement and the Amended Settlement Agreement until a performance bond was issued as described in the following sentence. The performance bond was issued during the fourth quarter of 2018. Refer to Note 26 for disclosures surrounding the WVDEP Settlement Agreement.\nIncome Taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction in which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including the expected reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, taxable income available via carryback to prior years, tax planning strategies, and results of recent operations. We assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets, including scheduling the reversal of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, to determine the amount of valuation allowance needed. Scheduling the reversal of deferred tax asset and liability balances requires judgment and estimation. We believe the deferred tax liabilities relied upon as future taxable income in our assessment will reverse in the same period and jurisdiction and are of the same character as the temporary differences giving rise to the deferred tax assets that will be realized. At December 31, 2018, a valuation allowance of $94.8 million has been provided on federal and state net operating losses and gross deferred tax assets not expected to provide future tax benefits.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $121.3 million, primarily driven by the purchase of additional ownership interest in equity affiliate of $13.3 million, cash paid on the sale of Powder River Basin of $21.4 million, capital expenditures of $83.1 million, and capital contributions to equity affiliates of $5.7 million, partially offset by proceeds on disposal of assets of $2.6 million.\nCosts and Expenses\nIncome taxes. Income tax benefit of $165.4 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018 on income from continuing operations before income taxes of $137.5 million. The effective tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the impact of the net operating loss carryback benefit and the reduction in the valuation allowance.\n(4) Represents obligations under certain equipment purchase agreements that contain minimum quantities to be purchased in 2019.\n(1) Subsequent to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606 during the current year, freight and handling fulfillment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 are included within coal revenues. See Note 5.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had real property collateralizing $26.7 million of reclamation bonds.\n\nWe believe that cash on hand and cash generated from our operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisition-related obligations, and reclamation obligations for the next 12 months. We have relied on a number of assumptions in budgeting for our future activities. These include the costs for mine development to sustain capacity of our operating mines, our cash flows from operations, effects of regulation and taxes by governmental agencies, mining technology improvements and reclamation costs. These assumptions are inherently subject to significant business, political, economic, regulatory, environmental and competitive uncertainties, contingencies and risks, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. We may need to raise additional funds more quickly if market conditions deteriorate, and we may not be able to do so in a timely fashion, or at all; or one or more of our assumptions proves to be incorrect or if we choose to expand our acquisition, exploration, appraisal, or development efforts or any other activity more rapidly than we presently anticipate. We may decide to raise additional funds before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable. We may seek to sell equity or debt securities or obtain\nCost of coal sales was $319.8 million, freight and handling costs were $70.5 million, depreciation, depletion and amortization was $6.0 million, accretion on asset retirement obligations was $4.8 million, amortization of acquired intangibles, net was $61.3 million and selling, general and administrative expenses were $19.1 million for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016.\n\n \u2022 Discount Rate. Asset retirement obligations are initially recorded at fair value. We utilize discounted cash flow techniques to estimate the fair value of our obligations. We base our discount rate on the rates of treasury bonds with maturities similar to expected mine lives and adjust for our credit standing as necessary after considering funding and assurance provisions. Changes in our credit standing could have a material impact on our asset retirement obligations. \nMerger related costs. The Merger related costs of $51.8 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 related primarily to professional fees, severance pay and incentive pay incurred related to the Merger Agreement entered into with the Alpha Companies on April 29, 2018.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased $2.8 million, or 7.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period, primarily due to higher interest costs associated with Company debt as a result of the current year debt refinancing. See Note 15 for additional information.\nCosts and Expenses\nAmortization of acquired intangibles, net. Amortization of acquired intangibles, net decreased $64.4 million, or 109.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. The decrease was primarily driven by the write-off of above-market coal sales contract assets during 2017 associated with the sale of PRB, certain other above-market coal sales contract assets being fully amortized as of December 31, 2017, and the amortization related to below-market acquired intangibles acquired as a result of the Merger, partially offset by the accelerated amortization of acquired intangibles related to the above-market coal sales contract asset related to FirstEnergy Generation, LLC during the current period.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 25, 2016 was $25.0 million, driven by capital expenditures of $23.4 million and capital contributions to equity affiliates of $2.1 million, partially offset by proceeds on disposal of assets of $0.5 million.\nThe bargain purchase gain of $7.7 million for the period from July 26, 2016 to December 31, 2016 resulted from the excess of the fair value of the acquired assets over liabilities assumed through the Acquisition.\nThe change in fair value of the Contingent Credit Support Commitment resulted from a reduction in our estimated obligation to provide ANR with revolving credit support. The fair value calculation was based on a probability-weighted scenario analysis. The inputs to this analysis included ANR's projected short-term cash flows, which were derived from the ANR financial statements and operating budget provided pursuant to the terms of the agreement. The cash position of ANR at December 31, 2016 increased relative to the projections used at the Acquisition Date resulting in a gain of $17.4 million in the estimated fair value of this obligation. Based on relevant factors including ANR's current cash balance, near-term estimated met coal prices, the September 30, 2018 termination date to loan funds, and the provision that loans can only be requested if ANR's unrestricted cash is below $20.0 million, we adjusted the liability down to $4.6 million for this obligation. Absent a significant change in ANR's cash position and related projections, we do not expect the obligation to change significantly.\nWe manage our commodity price risk for coal sales through the use of coal supply agreements. As of March 15, 2019, we expect to ship on sales commitments of approximately 6.5 million tons of NAPP coal for 2019, 96% of which is priced at an average realized price per ton of $42.85, 9.3 million tons of CAPP - Met coal for 2019, 60% of which is priced at an average realized price per ton of $123.82, and 4.9 million tons of CAPP - Thermal coal for 2019, 90% of which is priced at an average realized price per ton of $57.67.", "item_7_tables": "Table 190: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>
