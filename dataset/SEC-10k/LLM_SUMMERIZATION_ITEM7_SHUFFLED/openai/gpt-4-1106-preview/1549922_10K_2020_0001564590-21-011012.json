Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nMD&A is intended to inform the reader about matters affecting the financial condition and results of operations of the Partnership and its subsidiaries. As a result, the following discussion for the year ended December 31, 2020 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Annual Report. Among other things, the consolidated financial statements and the related notes include more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following information. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that constitute our plans, estimates and beliefs. These forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those discussed in Forward-Looking Statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. The discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 included in Exhibit 99.2, Updated 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Form 8-K dated August 7, 2020, is incorporated by reference into this MD&A.\nOverview\nWe are a value-driven limited partnership focused on developing, owning and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets that are strategically located in unconventional resource basins, primarily shale formations, in the continental United States.\nWe classify our midstream energy infrastructure assets into two categories, our Core Focus Areas and our Legacy Areas. Further details on our Focus Areas and Legacy Areas are summarized below.\nTable 216: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Core Focus Areas. Core producing areas of basins in which we expect our gathering systems to experience greater long-term growth, driven by our customers' ability to generate more favorable returns and support sustained drilling and completion activity in varying commodity price environments. In the near-term, we expect to concentrate the majority of our capital expenditures in our Core Focus Areas. Our Utica Shale, Ohio Gathering, Williston Basin, DJ Basin and Permian Basin reportable segments (as described below) comprise our Core Focus Areas.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Legacy Areas. Production basins in which we expect volume throughput on our gathering systems to experience relatively lower long-term growth compared to our Core Focus Areas, given that our customers require relatively higher commodity prices to support drilling and completion activities in these basins. Upstream production served by our gathering systems in our Legacy Areas is generally more mature, as compared to our Core Focus Areas, and the decline rates for volume throughput on our gathering systems in the Legacy Areas are typically lower as a result. We expect to continue to decrease our near-term capital expenditures in these Legacy Areas. Our Piceance Basin, Barnett Shale and Marcellus Shale reportable segments (as described below) comprise our Legacy Areas.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur financial results are driven primarily by volume throughput across our gathering systems and by expense management. We generate the majority of our revenues from the gathering, compression, treating and processing services that we provide to our customers. A majority of the volumes that we gather, compress, treat and/or process have a fixed-fee rate structure which enhances the stability of our cash flows by providing a revenue stream that is not subject to direct commodity price risk. We also earn a portion of our revenues from the following activities that directly expose us to fluctuations in commodity prices: (i) the sale of physical natural gas and/or NGLs purchased under percentage-of-proceeds or other processing arrangements with certain of our customers in the Williston Basin, Piceance Basin, and Permian Basin segments, (ii) the sale of natural gas we retain from certain Barnett Shale customers and (iii) the sale of condensate we retain from our gathering services in the Piceance Basin segment. During the year ended December 31, 2020, these additional activities accounted for approximately 13% of total revenues.\nWe also have indirect exposure to changes in commodity prices in that persistently low commodity prices may cause our customers to delay and/or cancel drilling and/or completion activities or temporarily shut-in production, which would reduce the volumes of natural gas and crude oil (and associated volumes of produced water) that we gather. If certain of our customers cancel or delay drilling and/or completion activities or temporarily shut-in production, the associated MVCs, if any, ensure that we will earn a minimum amount of revenue.\nThe following table presents certain consolidated and reportable segment financial data. For additional information on our reportable segments, see the \"Segment Overview for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\u201d section herein.\nTable 218: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 189,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (393,726\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reportable segment adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Utica Shale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ohio Gathering\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Williston Basin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DJ Basin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Permian Basin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (879\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Piceance Basin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 88,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 98,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Barnett Shale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marcellus Shale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 198,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 161,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital expenditures(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 182,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment in Double E equity method investee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 99,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash distributions to noncontrolling interest\nSMLP unitholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 68,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Series A Preferred Unit distributions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net borrowings under Revolving\nCredit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 180,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 211,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repayments on SMPH term loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,300\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (65,250\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Open Market Repurchases of 2022 and\n2025 Senior Notes (Note 9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (145,567\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tender Offers of 2022 and 2025 Senior Notes (Note 9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (47,530\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TL Restructuring (Note 9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (26,500\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from issuance of Subsidiary Series A preferred units,\nnet of issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Preferred Tender (Note 9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase of common units in GP Buy-In\nTransaction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (41,778\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" herein and Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital expenditures.\nKey Matters for the Year ended December 31, 2020.

To the extent our underlying assumptions about, or interpretations of, available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.\nOngoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced demand and prices for oil. We are closely monitoring the impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 on all aspects of our business, including how it has impacted and will impact our customers, employees, supply chain and distribution network. We are unable to predict the ultimate impact that COVID-19 and related factors may have on our business, future results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Given the dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and related market conditions, we cannot reasonably estimate the period of time that these events will persist or the full extent of the impact they will have on our business. The extent to which our operations may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including changes in the severity of the pandemic, countermeasures taken by governments, businesses and individuals to slow the spread of the pandemic, and the development and availability of treatments and vaccines and the extent to which these treatments and vaccines may remain effective as potential new strains of the coronavirus emerge. Furthermore, the impacts of a potential worsening of global economic conditions and the continued disruptions to and volatility in the financial markets remain unknown.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have modified our business practices, including restricting employee travel, modifying employee work locations, implementing social distancing and enhancing sanitary measures in our facilities. Many of our suppliers, vendors and service providers have made similar modifications. The resources available to employees working remotely may not enable them to maintain the same level of productivity and efficiency, and these and other employees may face additional demands on their time. Our increased reliance on remote access to our information systems increases our exposure to potential cybersecurity breaches. We may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, in which case our employees may become sick, our ability to perform critical functions could be impaired, and we may be unable to respond to the needs of our business. The resumption of normal business operations after such interruptions may be delayed or constrained by lingering effects of COVID-19 on our suppliers, third-party service providers, and/or customers.\nIn addition to the significant reduction in global demand for oil and natural gas caused by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were also volatile oil prices during 2020 largely due to a supply and demand imbalance and actions by members of OPEC and other foreign, oil-exporting countries. This disrupted the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry and other industries that serve exploration and production companies. These industry conditions, coupled with those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, could lead to significant global economic contraction generally and in our industry in particular.\nOver the past several months, we have collaborated extensively with our customer base regarding production reductions and delays to drilling and completion activities in light of the current commodity price backdrop and COVID-19 pandemic. Given\ncontinued volatility in market conditions since March 2020, and based on recently updated production forecasts and 2021 development plans from our customers, we currently expect our 2021 results to be affected by decreased drilling activity.\nNatural gas, NGL and crude oil supply and demand dynamics. Natural gas continues to be a critical component of energy supply and demand in the United States. The average spot price of natural gas decreased by approximately 21% from 2020 to 2019, primarily due to natural gas supply exceeding demand. The average daily Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price was $2.03 per MMBtu during 2020, compared with $2.56 per MMBtu during 2019. Henry Hub closed at $2.36 per MMBtu on December 31, 2020. As of February 18, 2021, Henry Hub 12-month strip pricing closed at $3.11 per MMBtu. Natural gas prices continue to trade at lower-than-average historical prices due in part to increased natural gas production and an elevated level of natural gas in storage in the continental United States. The average amount of working natural gas in underground storage in the continental U.S. was 3.05 Tcfe in 2020, which was 23.4% higher than in 2019. In the near term, we believe that until the supply of natural gas in storage has been reduced, natural gas prices are likely to remain constrained. Over the long term, we believe that the prospects for continued natural gas demand are favorable and will be driven primarily by global population and economic growth, as well as the continued displacement of coal-fired electricity generation by natural gas-fired electricity generation. However, we note that over the last several years there has been an increasing societal opposition to the production of hydrocarbons generally, which may be reflected in legislation, executive orders or regulations that may significantly restrict the domestic production of fossil fuels, including natural gas.\nIn addition, certain of our gathering systems are directly affected by crude oil supply and demand dynamics. Crude oil prices decreased in 2020, with the average daily Cushing, Oklahoma West Texas Intermediate crude oil spot price decreasing from an average $56.99 per barrel during 2019 to an average of $39.16 per barrel during 2020, representing a 31.3% decrease, reflecting broader market concerns for global oil supply and demand dynamics. In response to the general decrease in crude oil prices, the number of active crude oil drilling rigs in the continental United States decreased from 677 in December 2019 to 267 in December 2020, according to Baker Hughes. Over the next several years, we expect that crude oil prices will support continued drilling activity and increasing production in the Williston Basin, Permian Basin and, given the current regulatory environment in Colorado, in rural parts of the DJ Basin.\nGrowth in production from U.S. shale plays. Over the past several years, natural gas production from unconventional shale resources has increased significantly due to advances in technology that allow producers to extract significant volumes of natural gas from unconventional shale plays on favorable economic terms relative to most conventional plays. In recent years, a number of producers and their joint venture partners, including large international operators, industrial manufacturers and private equity sponsors, have committed significant capital to the development of these unconventional resources, including the Piceance, Barnett, Bakken, Marcellus, Utica and Permian Basin shale plays in which we operate, and we believe that these long-term capital investments will support drilling activity in unconventional shale plays over the long term.\nRate of growth in production from U.S. shale plays. Some of our producer customers have adjusted their drilling and completion activities and schedules to manage drilling and completion costs at levels that are achievable using internally generated cash flow from their underlying operations. Historically, as part of a strategy to accelerate production growth, these producers would raise external capital to fund drilling and completion costs in excess of the cash flows generated from their underlying assets. In general, we expect our producer customers to maintain moderate completion and production activities across many of our systems relative to our previous expectations as a result of the commodity price environment and a continuation of the general trend of producers constraining drilling and completion activity to levels that can be satisfied with internally generated cash flow.\nCapital markets availability and cost of capital. Credit markets were volatile throughout 2019, as borrowing costs increased and investors assessed the impact of rising rates on broader economic activity. Capital markets conditions, including but not limited to availability and higher borrowing costs, could affect our ability to access the debt capital markets to the extent necessary, to fund our future growth. Furthermore, market demand for equity issued by master limited partnerships has been significantly lower in recent years than it has been historically, which may make it more challenging for us to finance our capital expenditures with the issuance of additional equity. We announced the elimination of our common unit distribution in May 2020 beginning with the distribution paid in respect of the second quarter of 2020, and this action may further reduce demand for our common units. In addition, interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly.\nShifts in operating costs and inflation. Throughout most of the last five years, high levels of crude oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities across the United States resulted in increased competition for personnel and equipment as well as higher prices for labor, supplies, equipment and other services. Beginning in 2015, this dynamic began to shift as prices for crude oil and natural gas-related services decreased in line with overall decline in demand for these goods and services. While we expect lower service-related costs in the near term, we expect that over the longer term, these costs will continue to have a high correlation to changes in the prevailing price of crude oil and natural gas.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nWe conduct and report our operations in the midstream energy industry through eight reportable segments: Utica Shale, Ohio Gathering, Williston Basin, DJ Basin, Permian Basin, Piceance Basin, Barnett Shale, and Marcellus Shale. Each of our reportable segments provides midstream services in a specific geographic area and our reportable segments reflect the way in which we internally report the financial information used to make decisions and allocate resources in connection with our operations (see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements). Our management uses a variety of financial and operational metrics to analyze our consolidated and segment performance and we view these metrics as important factors in evaluating our profitability. These metrics include (i) throughput volume, (ii) revenues, (iii) operation and maintenance expenses, and (iv) segment adjusted EBITDA.\nThroughput Volume\nThe volume of (i) natural gas that we gather, compress, treat and/or process and (ii) crude oil and produced water that we gather depends on the level of production from natural gas or crude oil wells connected to our gathering systems. Aggregate production volumes are impacted by the overall amount of drilling and completion activity. Furthermore, because the production rate of natural gas and crude oil wells decline over time, production can only be maintained or increased by new drilling or other activity.\nAs a result, we must continually obtain new supplies of production to maintain or increase the throughput volume on our systems. Our ability to maintain or increase throughput volumes from existing customers and obtain new supplies of throughput is impacted by:\nTable 243: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> successful drilling activity within our AMIs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 244: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the level of work-overs and recompletions of wells on existing pad sites to which our gathering systems are connected;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 245: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the number of new pad sites in our AMIs awaiting connections;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 246: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells in the areas in which we operate outside of our existing AMIs; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 247: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to gather, treat and/or process production that has been released from commitments with our competitors.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe report volumes gathered for natural gas in cubic feet per day. We aggregate crude oil and produced water gathering and report volumes gathered in barrels per day.\nRevenues\nOur revenues are primarily attributable to the volumes that we gather, compress, treat and/or process and the rates we charge for those services. A majority of our gathering and processing agreements are fee-based, which limits our direct exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. We also have percent-of-proceeds arrangements with certain customers under which the gathering and processing revenues that we earn correlate directly with the fluctuating price of natural gas, condensate and NGLs.\nCertain of our gathering and processing agreements contain MVCs pursuant to which our customers agree to ship or process a minimum volume of production on our gathering systems, or, in some cases, to pay a minimum monetary amount, over certain periods during the term of the MVC. These MVCs help us generate stable revenues and serve to mitigate the financial impact associated with declining volumes.\nOperation and Maintenance Expenses\nWe seek to maximize the profitability of our operations in part by minimizing, to the extent appropriate, expenses directly tied to operating our assets. Direct labor costs, compression costs, ad valorem taxes, repair and non-capitalized maintenance costs, integrity management costs, utilities and contract services comprise the most significant portion of our operation and maintenance expense. Other than utilities expense, these expenses are largely independent of volumes delivered through our gathering systems but may fluctuate depending on the activities performed during a specific period.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nSegment adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental financial measure used by management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA is used to assess:\nTable 248: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to make cash distributions and support our indebtedness;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 249: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 250: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our operating performance and return on capital as compared to other companies in the midstream energy sector, without regard to financing or capital structure;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 251: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the attractiveness of capital projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 252: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the financial performance of our assets without regard to (i) income or loss from equity method investees, (ii) the impact of the timing of MVC shortfall payments under our gathering agreements or (iii) the timing of impairments or other noncash income or expense items.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdditional Information.

Total revenues attributable to Corporate and Other was due to gathering services, natural gas, and condensate sales. The decrease of $25.0 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to the wind down of our marketing group in 2020 as well as lower natural gas activity.\nCost of Natural Gas and NGLs. Cost of natural gas and NGLs attributable to Corporate and Other was due to natural gas, NGL and crude oil marketing services in 2019. The decrease of $26.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was attributable to the wind down of our marketing group in 2020.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expense attributable to Corporate and Other increased by $16.5 million, primarily related to a $17.0 million loss contingency accrual in 2020, see note 11 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nTransaction costs. Transaction costs recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 are primarily related to costs associated with our liability management initiatives.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased $13.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of our liability management initiatives which included our Open Market Repurchases and Tender Offers, partially offset by a higher outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility.\nGain on Early Extinguishment of Debt. The gain on the early extinguishment of debt is primarily related to liability management initiatives undertaken during 2020 that resulted in a $86.4 million gain from the Open Market Repurchases, a $23.3 million gain from the Debt Tender Offers, and a $93.9 million gain from our TL Restructuring.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe depend primarily on funds generated from our operations, our Revolving Credit Facility, our cash and cash equivalents balance, and capital markets as our primary sources of liquidity. Looking forward to 2021, we will seek to reduce indebtedness and extend our indebtedness maturities. As a result, we expect to fund future expenditures from cash generated by our operations, our Revolving Credit Facility, our cash equivalents on hand. If optimal, we may also consider accessing the capital markets, opportunistic divestitures or joint ventures involving our existing midstream assets.\nDebt\nRevolving Credit Facility. We have a $1.1 billion senior secured Revolving Credit Facility with a maturity of May 2022 (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements). As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance of the Revolving Credit Facility was $857.0 million and the unused portion totaled $238.9 million, after giving effect to the issuance thereunder of a $4.1 million\noutstanding but undrawn irrevocable standby letter of credit. Based on covenant limits, our available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $105 million. There were no defaults or events of default during 2020, and as of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the financial covenants in the Revolving Credit Facility. Our total leverage ratio and senior secured leverage ratio (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) was 5.1 to 1.0 and 3.2 to 1.0, respectively, relative to maximum threshold limits of 5.75 to 1.0 and 3.5 to 1.0. Given further deterioration of market conditions, decreased drilling activity, the deferral of well completions from customers, limitations on our ability to access the capital markets at a competitive cost to fund our capital expenditures and, on a limited scale, temporary production curtailments, we could have total leverage and senior secured leverage ratios that are higher than the levels prescribed in the applicable indebtedness agreements. Adverse developments in our areas of operation could materially adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the Revolving Credit Facility and the issuance of the $4.1 million letter of credit.\n2022 Senior Notes. In July 2014, Summit Holdings and its 100% owned finance subsidiary, Finance Corp. (together with Summit Holdings, the \"Co-Issuers\") co-issued $300.0 million of 5.5% senior unsecured notes maturing August 15, 2022 (the \"2022 Senior Notes\" and, together with the 2025 Senior Notes (defined below), the Senior Notes\u201d). As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance of the 2022 Senior Notes is $234.0 million. We pay interest on the 2022 Senior Notes semi-annually in cash in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The 2022 Senior Notes are senior, unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior obligations. The 2022 Senior Notes are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all secured indebtedness, to the extent of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The Co-Issuers may redeem all or part of the 2022 Senior Notes at a redemption price of 100.000%, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Debt issuance costs of $5.1 million are being amortized over the life of the 2022 Senior Notes. As of and during the year ended December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the financial covenants governing our 2022 Senior Notes.\n2025 Senior Notes. In February 2017, the Co-Issuers co-issued $500.0 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes maturing April 15, 2025 (the 2025 Senior Notes\u201d). As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance of the 2025 Senior Notes was $259.5 million. We pay interest on the 2025 Senior Notes semi-annually in cash in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year. The 2025 Senior Notes are senior, unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior obligations. The 2025 Senior Notes are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all of our secured indebtedness, to the extent of the collateral securing such indebtedness.\nThe Co-Issuers may redeem all or part of the 2025 Senior Notes at a redemption price of 104.313% (with the redemption price declining ratably each April 15 to 100.000% on April 15, 2023), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. Debt issuance costs of $7.7 million are being amortized over the life of the 2025 Senior Notes. As of and during the year ended December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the financial covenants governing our 2025 Senior Notes.\nFor additional information on our long-term debt, see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCash Flows\nTable 286: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 198,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 161,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (140,569\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (90,870\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (79,398\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (50,122\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (21,378\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe components of the net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were as follows:\nOperating activities.

We believe that our Revolving Credit Facility, together with internally generated cash flow and access to debt or equity capital markets, will be adequate to finance our business for the next twelve months without adversely impacting our liquidity.\nWith the completion of our 60 MMcf/d DJ Basin processing plant and compression expansions in the Permian Basin, capital expenditures began to decline in the third and fourth quarter of 2019 and continued throughout 2020. We will remain disciplined with respect to future capital expenditures, which will be primarily concentrated on the Double E Project and accretive expansions of our existing systems in our Core Focus Areas. We continue to advance our financing plans for our equity interest in Double E, which we intend to be credit positive to Summit. We are currently targeting a financing structure that limits cash payments by us during 2021, and which shifts a substantial majority of our Double E capital commitments to third parties, including commercial banks. On December 24, 2019, we entered into an agreement with TPG to fund up to $80.0 million of Permian Holdco's future capital calls associated with the Double E Project. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Permian Holdco issued 55,251 and 30,000 Subsidiary Series A Preferred Units to TPG for net proceeds of $48.7 million and $27.4 million, respectively.\nWe estimate that our 2021 capital program will range from $20.0 million to $35.0 million, including approximately $10.0 million of maintenance capital expenditures.\nThere are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our current expectations to change, including, but not limited to, (i) the ability to reach agreement with third parties; (ii) prevailing conditions and outlook in the natural gas, crude oil and NGL industries and markets and (iii) our ability to obtain financing from commercial banks, the capital markets, or other financing sources.\nCredit and Counterparty Concentration Risks\nWe examine the creditworthiness of counterparties to whom we extend credit and manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, credit approval, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and for certain transactions, we may request letters of credit, prepayments or guarantees.\nCertain of our customers may be temporarily unable to meet their current obligations. While this may cause disruption to cash flows, we believe that we are properly positioned to deal with the potential disruption because the vast majority of our gathering assets are strategically positioned at the beginning of the midstream value chain. The majority of our infrastructure is connected directly to our customers' wellheads and pad sites, which means our gathering systems are typically the first third-party infrastructure through which our customers' commodities flow and, in many cases, the only way for our customers to get their production to market.\nWe have exposure due to nonperformance under our MVC contracts whereby a customer, who was not meeting its MVCs, does not have the wherewithal to make its MVC shortfall payments when they become due. We typically receive payment for all prior-year MVC shortfall billings in the quarter immediately following billing. Therefore, our exposure to risk of nonperformance is limited to and accumulates during the current year-to-date contracted measurement period.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe may enter into off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off-balance sheet obligations. As of December 31, 2020, our material off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions include (i) a parental guaranty issued on behalf of a wholly owned subsidiary to fund the subsidiary's pro rata share of required Double E Project construction related capital calls, with the wholly owned subsidiary having an estimated $172.4 million of remaining capital calls due for construction based on the Partnership's best estimate at December 31, 2020, (ii) letters of credit outstanding against our Revolving Credit Facility aggregating to $4.1 million, and (iii) outstanding surety bonds aggregating to $7.1 million. There are no other transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or availability of our capital resources.\nSummarized Financial Information\nOn March 2, 2020, the SEC issued Final Rule Release No. 33-10762, Financial Disclosures about Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities and Affiliates Whose Securities Collateralize a Registrant's Securities ( Release 33-10762\u201d), that amends the disclosure requirements related to certain registered securities that are guaranteed and those that are collateralized by the securities of an affiliate.\nUnder Release 33-10762, an SEC registrant may continue to omit separate financial statements of subsidiary issuers and guarantors when (1) the subsidiary issuer is consolidated with the parent company and its security is either (a) co-issued jointly and severally with the parent company's security or (b) the subsidiary issuer's security is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the parent company and (2) the parent company provides supplemental financial and non-financial disclosure about the subsidiary issuers and/or guarantors and the guarantees.\nThe rules become effective January 4, 2021, with voluntary compliance permitted immediately. The Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by SMLP and the Guarantor Subsidiaries (see Note 9 - Debt). SMLP has concluded that it is eligible to provide Alternative Disclosures under the amended disclosure requirements and has early adopted Release 33-10762.\nThe supplemental summarized financial information below reflects SMLP's separate accounts, the combined accounts of the Co-Issuers and the Guarantor Subsidiaries (the Co-Issuers and, together with the Guarantor Subsidiaries, the Obligor Group\u201d) for the dates and periods indicated. The financial information of the Obligor Group is presented on a combined basis and intercompany balances and transactions between the Co-Issuers and Guarantor Subsidiaries have been eliminated. There were no reportable transactions between the Co-Issuers and Obligor Group and the subsidiaries that were not issuers or guarantors of the Senior Notes.\nPayments to holders of the Senior Notes are affected by the composition of and relationships among the Co-Issuers, the Guarantor Subsidiaries and Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, who are unrestricted subsidiaries of SMLP and are not issuers or guarantors of the Senior Notes. The assets of our unrestricted subsidiaries are not available to satisfy the demands of the holders of the Senior Notes. In addition, our unrestricted subsidiaries are subject to certain contractual restrictions related to the payment of dividends, and other rights in favor of their non-affiliated stakeholders, that limit their ability to satisfy the demands of the holders of the Senior Notes.\nA list of each of SMLP's subsidiaries that is a guarantor, issuer or co-issuer of our registered securities subject to the reporting requirements in Release 33-10762 is filed as Exhibit 22.1 to this Annual Report.\nSummarized Balance Sheet Information.

The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities,\nrevenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following describes significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. As of December 31, 2020, we had net property, plant and equipment with a carrying value of approximately $1.8 billion and net amortizing intangible assets with a carrying value of approximately $200.0 million. When evidence exists that we will not be able to recover a long-lived asset's carrying value through future cash flows, we write down the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value. We test assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. With respect to property, plant and equipment and our amortizing intangible assets, the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if the carrying value exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the asset's use and eventual disposal. In this situation, we would recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the asset's fair value. We determine fair value using a combination of approaches, including a market-based approach and an income-based approach in which we discount the asset's expected future cash flows to reflect the risk associated with achieving the underlying cash flows. Any impairment determinations involve significant assumptions and judgments. Differing assumptions regarding any of these inputs could have a significant effect on the various valuations. As such, the fair value measurements utilized within these estimates are classified as non-recurring Level 3 measurements in the fair value hierarchy because they are not observable from objective sources. Due to the volatility of the inputs used, we cannot predict the likelihood of any future impairment.\nWe evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when we believe the current fair value may be less than the carrying amount and record an impairment if we believe the decline in value is other than temporary.\nAdjustments for MVC Shortfall Payments. For our calculation of segment adjusted EBITDA, we estimate the impact of expected MVC shortfall payments based on assumptions that include, but are not limited to, contract terms, historical volume throughput data, and expectations regarding future investment expenditures, customer drilling activities, and customer production volumes.", "item_7_truncated": "Marcellus Shale.

Throughout most of the last five years, high levels of crude oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities across the United States resulted in increased competition for personnel and equipment as well as higher prices for labor, supplies, equipment and other services. Beginning in 2015, this dynamic began to shift as prices for crude oil and natural gas-related services decreased in line with overall decline in demand for these goods and services. While we expect lower service-related costs in the near term, we expect that over the longer term, these costs will continue to have a high correlation to changes in the prevailing price of crude oil and natural gas.\nTable 282: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Barnett Shale\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Natural gas continues to be a critical component of energy supply and demand in the United States. The average spot price of natural gas decreased by approximately 21% from 2020 to 2019, primarily due to natural gas supply exceeding demand. The average daily Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price was $2.03 per MMBtu during 2020, compared with $2.56 per MMBtu during 2019. Henry Hub closed at $2.36 per MMBtu on December 31, 2020. As of February 18, 2021, Henry Hub 12-month strip pricing closed at $3.11 per MMBtu. Natural gas prices continue to trade at lower-than-average historical prices due in part to increased natural gas production and an elevated level of natural gas in storage in the continental United States. The average amount of working natural gas in underground storage in the continental U.S. was 3.05 Tcfe in 2020, which was 23.4% higher than in 2019. In the near term, we believe that until the supply of natural gas in storage has been reduced, natural gas prices are likely to remain constrained. Over the long term, we believe that the prospects for continued natural gas demand are favorable and will be driven primarily by global population and economic growth, as well as the continued displacement of coal-fired electricity generation by natural gas-fired electricity generation. However, we note that over the last several years there has been an increasing societal opposition to the production of hydrocarbons generally, which may be reflected in legislation, executive orders or regulations that may significantly restrict the domestic production of fossil fuels, including natural gas.\nTable 253: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td>

Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $3.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the volume throughput previously discussed.\n \u2022 Disposition. In March 2019, we identified certain triggering events which indicated that certain long-lived assets in the DJ Basin and Barnett Shale reporting segments could be impaired. Consequently, we performed a recoverability assessment of certain assets within these reporting segments. In the DJ Basin, we determined certain processing plant assets related to our 20 MMcf/d plant would no longer be operational due to our expansion plans for the Niobrara G&P system and we recorded an impairment charge of $34.7 million related to these assets. In the Barnett Shale, we determined certain compressor station assets would be shut down and de-commissioned and we recorded an impairment charge of $9.7 million related to these assets. \nThe rules become effective January 4, 2021, with voluntary compliance permitted immediately. The Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by SMLP and the Guarantor Subsidiaries (see Note 9 - Debt). SMLP has concluded that it is eligible to provide Alternative Disclosures under the amended disclosure requirements and has early adopted Release 33-10762.\nOur financial results are driven primarily by volume throughput across our gathering systems and by expense management. We generate the majority of our revenues from the gathering, compression, treating and processing services that we provide to our customers. A majority of the volumes that we gather, compress, treat and/or process have a fixed-fee rate structure which enhances the stability of our cash flows by providing a revenue stream that is not subject to direct commodity price risk. We also earn a portion of our revenues from the following activities that directly expose us to fluctuations in commodity prices: (i) the sale of physical natural gas and/or NGLs purchased under percentage-of-proceeds or other processing arrangements with certain of our customers in the Williston Basin, Piceance Basin, and Permian Basin segments, (ii) the sale of natural gas we retain from certain Barnett Shale customers and (iii) the sale of condensate we retain from our gathering services in the Piceance Basin segment. During the year ended December 31, 2020, these additional activities accounted for approximately 13% of total revenues.\n \u2022 2019 Restructuring Costs. In the third quarter of 2019, we began an internal initiative to evaluate and transform our cost structure, enhance margins and improve our competitive position in response to a weakening commodity price backdrop. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred approximately $5.0 million in restructuring costs relating to this initiative (included in general and administrative expense). For the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred an additional $3.5 million related to this initiative. \n \u2022 the attractiveness of capital projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities; and \n \u2022 $145.6 million paid for open market repurchases of the 2022 and 2025 Notes; \nRevolving Credit Facility.

As of December 31, 2020, our material off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions include (i) a parental guaranty issued on behalf of a wholly owned subsidiary to fund the subsidiary's pro rata share of required Double E Project construction related capital calls, with the wholly owned subsidiary having an estimated $172.4 million of remaining capital calls due for construction based on the Partnership's best estimate at December 31, 2020, (ii) letters of credit outstanding against our Revolving Credit Facility aggregating to $4.1 million, and (iii) outstanding surety bonds aggregating to $7.1 million. There are no other transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or availability of our capital resources.\n \u2022 TL Restructuring. In November 2020, the Partnership completed the TL Restructuring. All of the Term Loan Lenders participated in the TL Restructuring. As part of the TL Restructuring, the Partnership paid SMP Holdings $26.5 million in cash as consideration to fully settle the deferred purchase price obligation, which SMP Holdings then paid to the Term Loan Lenders. In addition, the Term Loan Lenders executed the Strict Foreclosure on the 2,306,972 common units pledged as collateral under the SMPH Term Loan in full satisfaction of SMP Holdings' outstanding obligations under the SMPH Term Loan. \n\n\n(1) Exclusive of volume throughput for Ohio Gathering. For additional information, see the \"Ohio Gathering\" section herein.\n \u2022 $35.0 million in proceeds from the ECP Loan. \nIn addition to the significant reduction in global demand for oil and natural gas caused by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were also volatile oil prices during 2020 largely due to a supply and demand imbalance and actions by members of OPEC and other foreign, oil-exporting countries. This disrupted the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry and other industries that serve exploration and production companies. These industry conditions, coupled with those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, could lead to significant global economic contraction generally and in our industry in particular.\n\n \u2022 $7.3 million for a distribution from an equity method investment. \nCertain of our customers may be temporarily unable to meet their current obligations. While this may cause disruption to cash flows, we believe that we are properly positioned to deal with the potential disruption because the vast majority of our gathering assets are strategically positioned at the beginning of the midstream value chain. The majority of our infrastructure is connected directly to our customers' wellheads and pad sites, which means our gathering systems are typically the first third-party infrastructure through which our customers' commodities flow and, in many cases, the only way for our customers to get their production to market.\nVolume throughput in 2020 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of new well connections in the fourth quarter of 2019 and through the first quarter of 2020, partially offset by natural production declines from wells previously in service.\nGrowth in production from U.S. shale plays. Over the past several years, natural gas production from unconventional shale resources has increased significantly due to advances in technology that allow producers to extract significant volumes of natural gas from unconventional shale plays on favorable economic terms relative to most conventional plays. In recent years, a number of producers and their joint venture partners, including large international operators, industrial manufacturers and private equity sponsors, have committed significant capital to the development of these unconventional resources, including the Piceance, Barnett, Bakken, Marcellus, Utica and Permian Basin shale plays in which we operate, and we believe that these long-term capital investments will support drilling activity in unconventional shale plays over the long term.\nInterest Expense. The decrease in interest expense in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily a result of our liability management initiatives which included our Open Market Repurchases and Tender Offers, partially offset by a higher outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility.\n \u2022 Shifts in operating costs and inflation. \nCash Flows\nPayments to holders of the Senior Notes are affected by the composition of and relationships among the Co-Issuers, the Guarantor Subsidiaries and Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, who are unrestricted subsidiaries of SMLP and are not issuers or guarantors of the Senior Notes. The assets of our unrestricted subsidiaries are not available to satisfy the demands of the holders of the Senior Notes. In addition, our unrestricted subsidiaries are subject to certain contractual restrictions related to the payment of dividends, and other rights in favor of their non-affiliated stakeholders, that limit their ability to satisfy the demands of the holders of the Senior Notes.\nFinancial data for our Ohio Gathering reportable segment, based on a one-month lag follows.\n\nFinancial data for our Piceance Basin reportable segment follows.\n \u2022 December 2020 Series A Preferred Unit Tender. On December 29, 2020, the Partnership completed the Preferred Tender Offer, whereby it accepted 75,075 Series A Preferred Units for a purchase price of $333.00 per Series A Preferred Unit and an aggregate purchase price of $25.0 million. Upon closing the Preferred Tender Offer, it eliminated $82.7 million of the Series A Preferred Unit liquidation preference due as of the settlement date, inclusive of $7.6 million of accrued distributions. \nYear ended December 31, 2020. Segment adjusted EBITDA decreased $17.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily associated with the decreased liquid volume throughput described above, and the sale of Tioga Midstream in March of 2019. The decrease was partially offset by the increased natural gas volume throughput described above.\n \u2022 $47.5 million paid for tender offer of 2022 and 2025 Senior Notes; \n\n \u2022 Suspension of common and preferred unit distributions. In May 2020, and in conjunction with the GP Buy-In Transaction, the Partnership suspended distributions to holders of its common units and its Series A Preferred Units, commencing with respect to the quarter ending March 31, 2020. The suspension of distributions enabled the Partnership to retain an incremental $76 million per annum of operating cash flow and reallocate this retained cash to indebtedness reduction, liability management transactions and other corporate initiatives. The unpaid cash distributions on the Series A Preferred Units continue to accrue semi-annually, until paid. \nVolumes - Gas. Natural gas throughput volumes decreased 22 MMcf/d for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily reflecting:\nVolume throughput decreased in 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 reflecting natural production declines partially offset by new volumes from well recompletion and workover activity throughout 2020.\n \u2022 the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; \nSummarized Statements of Operations Information. For the purposes of the following summarized statements of operations, we allocate a portion of general and administrative expenses recognized at the SMLP parent to the Obligor Group to reflect what those entities' results would have been had they operated on a stand-alone basis. Summarized statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 follow.\nYear ended December 31, 2020. Segment adjusted EBITDA for equity method investees decreased $8.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily related to lower volume throughput described above.\n* Not considered meaningful\n \u2022 Equity Method Investment Impairment. In December 2019, we identified certain triggering events which indicated that our equity method investment in Ohio Gathering could be impaired. We completed an other-than-temporary impairment analysis to determine the potential equity method impairment charge to be recorded on our consolidated financial statements. As a result, an impairment charge of approximately $329.7 million was recorded in the loss from equity method investees caption on the consolidated statement of operations. \n \u2022 Open Market Repurchase of Senior Notes. Throughout 2020, the Partnership completed its Open Market Repurchases, which resulted in the extinguishment of $32.4 million of face value of the 2022 Senior Notes and $201.8 million of face value of the 2025 Senior Notes. Total cash consideration paid to repurchase the principal amounts outstanding of the 2022 Senior Notes and 2025 Senior Notes, plus accrued interest totaled $150.3 million and the Partnership recognized a $86.4 million gain on the extinguishment of debt related to these Open Market Repurchases during 2020. \n \u2022 Tioga Midstream. Until March 22, 2019, we owned Tioga Midstream, a crude oil, produced water and associated natural gas gathering system in the Williston Basin. On March 22, 2019, we sold the Tioga Midstream system to affiliates of Hess Infrastructure Partners LP for a combined cash purchase price of approximately $90 million and recorded a gain on sale of $0.9 million based on the difference between the consideration received and the carrying value for Tioga Midstream at closing. The gain is included in the Gain on asset sales, net caption on the consolidated statement of operations. The financial results of Tioga Midstream (a component of the Williston Basin reportable segment) are included in our consolidated financial statements and footnotes for the historical periods through March 22, 2019. Refer to Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for details on the sale of Tioga Midstream. \nCost of natural gas and NGLs. Cost of natural gas and NGLs decreased $26.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by lower natural gas, NGL and crude oil marketing activity.\n* Not considered meaningful\nMD&A is intended to inform the reader about matters affecting the financial condition and results of operations of the Partnership and its subsidiaries. As a result, the following discussion for the year ended December 31, 2020 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Annual Report. Among other things, the consolidated financial statements and the related notes include more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following information. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that constitute our plans, estimates and beliefs. These forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those discussed in Forward-Looking Statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. The discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 included in Exhibit 99.2, Updated 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Form 8-K dated August 7, 2020, is incorporated by reference into this MD&A.\n\n* Not considered meaningful\n*Not considered meaningful\n \u2022 the level of work-overs and recompletions of wells on existing pad sites to which our gathering systems are connected; \n \u2022 a volume throughput decrease of 88 MMcf/d for the Piceance Basin segment. \nKey Matters for the Year ended December 31, 2019. The following items are reflected in our financial results for the fiscal year ended 2019:\nDJ Basin. The Niobrara G&P system provides midstream services for the DJ Basin reportable segment. Volume throughput for our DJ Basin reportable segment follows.\n \u2022 expansion capital expenditures, which are cash expenditures incurred for acquisitions or capital improvements that we expect will increase our operating income or operating capacity over the long term. \n\nFinancial data for our Barnett Shale reportable segment follows.\nYear ended December 31, 2020. Segment adjusted EBITDA decreased $9.9 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily associated with the volume throughput decrease described above, and a decrease in operations and maintenance expense primarily due to lower compensation expense associated with lower headcount from our cost cutting initiatives.\ncontinued volatility in market conditions since March 2020, and based on recently updated production forecasts and 2021 development plans from our customers, we currently expect our 2021 results to be affected by decreased drilling activity.\nConsolidated Overview for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \u2022 a $14.7 million decrease in gathering services and related fees in the Piceance Basin relating to lower volume throughput due to a lack of drilling and completion activity and natural production declines. \n \u2022 Double E Project. For the year ended December 2020, the Partnership's proportionate share of capital calls due in 2020 totaled $99.9 million, which includes $2.7 million in capitalized interest, and was funded with $20.6 million of Partnership generated funds and the issuance of $85.3 million of Subsidiary Series A Preferred Units. \n \u2022 $89.5 million of net proceeds from the Tioga Midstream sale and $12.0 million of proceeds from the Red Rock Gathering sale; and \nWith the completion of our 60 MMcf/d DJ Basin processing plant and compression expansions in the Permian Basin, capital expenditures began to decline in the third and fourth quarter of 2019 and continued throughout 2020. We will remain disciplined with respect to future capital expenditures, which will be primarily concentrated on the Double E Project and accretive expansions of our existing systems in our Core Focus Areas. We continue to advance our financing plans for our equity interest in Double E, which we intend to be credit positive to Summit. We are currently targeting a financing structure that limits cash payments by us during 2021, and which shifts a substantial majority of our Double E capital commitments to third parties, including commercial banks. On December 24, 2019, we entered into an agreement with TPG to fund up to $80.0 million of Permian Holdco's future capital calls associated with the Double E Project. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Permian Holdco issued 55,251 and 30,000 Subsidiary Series A Preferred Units to TPG for net proceeds of $48.7 million and $27.4 million, respectively.\nSummarized Financial Information\n\nWe depend primarily on funds generated from our operations, our Revolving Credit Facility, our cash and cash equivalents balance, and capital markets as our primary sources of liquidity. Looking forward to 2021, we will seek to reduce indebtedness and extend our indebtedness maturities. As a result, we expect to fund future expenditures from cash generated by our operations, our Revolving Credit Facility, our cash equivalents on hand. If optimal, we may also consider accessing the capital markets, opportunistic divestitures or joint ventures involving our existing midstream assets.\n \u2022 July 2020 Series A Preferred Unit Exchange. In July 2020, the Partnership completed the Preferred Exchange Offer, whereby it issued 837,547 SMLP common units in exchange for 62,816 Series A Preferred Units. Upon closing the Preferred Exchange Offer, it eliminated $66.5 million of the Series A Preferred Unit liquidation preference amount, inclusive of $3.7 million of accrued distributions due as of the settlement date. \nDebt\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have modified our business practices, including restricting employee travel, modifying employee work locations, implementing social distancing and enhancing sanitary measures in our facilities. Many of our suppliers, vendors and service providers have made similar modifications. The resources available to employees working remotely may not enable them to maintain the same level of productivity and efficiency, and these and other employees may face additional demands on their time. Our increased reliance on remote access to our information systems increases our exposure to potential cybersecurity breaches. We may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, in which case our employees may become sick, our ability to perform critical functions could be impaired, and we may be unable to respond to the needs of our business. The resumption of normal business operations after such interruptions may be delayed or constrained by lingering effects of COVID-19 on our suppliers, third-party service providers, and/or customers.\n \u2022 Double E Project. In June 2019, we continued development of the Double E Project after securing firm 10-year commitments under binding precedent agreements for a substantial majority of the pipeline's initial throughput capacity of 1.35 Bcf of gas per day and executing the joint venture agreement (described below) with an affiliate of Double E's foundation shipper. The Double E Project, which consists of an approximately 116-mile mainline and related facilities, will provide interstate natural gas transportation service from the Delaware Basin production area to the Waha Hub in Texas. \nThe discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities,\nThe volume of (i) natural gas that we gather, compress, treat and/or process and (ii) crude oil and produced water that we gather depends on the level of production from natural gas or crude oil wells connected to our gathering systems. Aggregate production volumes are impacted by the overall amount of drilling and completion activity. Furthermore, because the production rate of natural gas and crude oil wells decline over time, production can only be maintained or increased by new drilling or other activity.\nKey Matters for the Year ended December 31, 2020. The following items are reflected in our financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020:\n \u2022 our operating performance and return on capital as compared to other companies in the midstream energy sector, without regard to financing or capital structure; \nVolume throughput decreased in 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of natural production declines.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased $13.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of our liability management initiatives which included our Open Market Repurchases and Tender Offers, partially offset by a higher outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility.\n \u2022 other changes in working capital. \nCapital markets availability and cost of capital. Credit markets were volatile throughout 2019, as borrowing costs increased and investors assessed the impact of rising rates on broader economic activity. Capital markets conditions, including but not limited to availability and higher borrowing costs, could affect our ability to access the debt capital markets to the extent necessary, to fund our future growth. Furthermore, market demand for equity issued by master limited partnerships has been significantly lower in recent years than it has been historically, which may make it more challenging for us to finance our capital expenditures with the issuance of additional equity. We announced the elimination of our common unit distribution in May 2020 beginning with the distribution paid in respect of the second quarter of 2020, and this action may further reduce demand for our common units. In addition, interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly.\n \u2022 Goodwill Impairment. In September 2019, in connection with our annual impairment evaluation, we determined that the fair value of the Mountaineer Midstream reporting unit did not exceed its carrying value and we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $16.2 million. \n \u2022 $35.0 million for the repayment of the ECP Loan; \n\n (1) The Partnership issued a parental guaranty on behalf of its wholly owned subsidiary to fund the subsidiary's pro rata share of required Double E construction project capital calls. As of December 31, 2020, this amount represents the Partnership's best estimate of its remaining obligation to fund Double E for the construction of the Double E Project. \nRevenues. Total revenues decreased $60.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year primarily comprised of a $24.0 million decrease in gathering services and related fees and a $37.7 million decrease in natural gas, NGLs and condensate sales.\nThere are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our current expectations to change, including, but not limited to, (i) the ability to reach agreement with third parties; (ii) prevailing conditions and outlook in the natural gas, crude oil and NGL industries and markets and (iii) our ability to obtain financing from commercial banks, the capital markets, or other financing sources.\nWe estimate that our 2021 capital program will range from $20.0 million to $35.0 million, including approximately $10.0 million of maintenance capital expenditures.\nTrends and Outlook\n \u2022 the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to make cash distributions and support our indebtedness; \n \u2022 Ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced demand and prices for oil; \nNatural gas. Natural gas volume throughput in 2020 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily reflecting the completion of new wells behind the Bison Midstream system in the fourth quarter of 2019 and through 2020 partially offset by natural production declines and the sale of Tioga Midstream.\nGain on Early Extinguishment of Debt. The gain on the early extinguishment of debt is primarily related to liability management initiatives undertaken during 2020 that resulted in a $86.4 million gain from the Open Market Repurchases, a $23.3 million gain from the Debt Tender Offers, and a $93.9 million gain from our TL Restructuring.\nOver the past several months, we have collaborated extensively with our customer base regarding production reductions and delays to drilling and completion activities in light of the current commodity price backdrop and COVID-19 pandemic. Given\n \u2022 2020 Restructuring Costs. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we completed an internal initiative to evaluate and transform our cost structure, enhance margins and improve our competitive position in response to COVID-19 and the related weakening of the economy. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred approximately $5.6 million in restructuring costs relating to this initiative (included in general and administrative expense). \nYear ended December 31, 2020. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $0.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily associated with a more favorable volume and gathering rate mix from customers.\nThe components of the net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were as follows:\n \u2022 a $6.5 million increase in gathering services and related fees in the Permian Basin primarily as a result of an uptick in customer volumes, partially offset by natural production declines from wells previously put in service. \nGross volume throughput for Ohio Gathering, based on a one-month lag follows.\nYear ended December 31, 2020. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $2.0 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily associated with the increased volume throughput described above.\nAdjustments for MVC Shortfall Payments. For our calculation of segment adjusted EBITDA, we estimate the impact of expected MVC shortfall payments based on assumptions that include, but are not limited to, contract terms, historical volume throughput data, and expectations regarding future investment expenditures, customer drilling activities, and customer production volumes.\n2025 Senior Notes. In February 2017, the Co-Issuers co-issued $500.0 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes maturing April 15, 2025 (the 2025 Senior Notes\u201d). As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance of the 2025 Senior Notes was $259.5 million. We pay interest on the 2025 Senior Notes semi-annually in cash in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year. The 2025 Senior Notes are senior, unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior obligations. The 2025 Senior Notes are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all of our secured indebtedness, to the extent of the collateral securing such indebtedness.\n \u2022 Red Rock. In December 2019, Red Rock Gathering and certain affiliates of SMLP (collectively, the Red Rock Parties\u201d) entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Red Rock PSA\u201d) pursuant to which the Red Rock Parties agreed to sell certain Red Rock Gathering system assets for a cash purchase price of $12.0 million (the Red Rock Sale\u201d). Prior to closing, we recorded an impairment charge of $14.2 million based on the expected consideration and the carrying value for the Red Rock Gathering system assets. On December 2, 2019, we closed the Red Rock Sale. The impairment is included in the Long-lived asset impairment caption on the consolidated statement of operations. The financial contribution of these assets (a component of the Piceance Basin reportable segment) are included in our consolidated financial statements and footnotes for the period from January 1, 2019 through December 1, 2019. \nAdditional Information. For additional information, see the \"Results of Operations\" section herein and the notes to the consolidated financial statements. For information on pending accounting changes that are expected to materially impact our financial results reported in future periods, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 a $16.2 million decrease in goodwill impairment charge relating to the Mountaineer Midstream system in the Marcellus Basin in 2019. \nCosts and expenses. Total costs and expenses decreased $76.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily reflecting:\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nResults of Operations\nThe Co-Issuers may redeem all or part of the 2025 Senior Notes at a redemption price of 104.313% (with the redemption price declining ratably each April 15 to 100.000% on April 15, 2023), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. Debt issuance costs of $7.7 million are being amortized over the life of the 2025 Senior Notes. As of and during the year ended December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the financial covenants governing our 2025 Senior Notes.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nCash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily reflected:\nA list of each of SMLP's subsidiaries that is a guarantor, issuer or co-issuer of our registered securities subject to the reporting requirements in Release 33-10762 is filed as Exhibit 22.1 to this Annual Report.\n \u2022 a $1.9 million increase in gathering services and related fees in the DJ Basin primarily as a result of ongoing drilling and completion activity across our service area, a more favorable volume and gathering rate mix from customers and the commissioning of our new natural gas processing plant in June 2019, partially offset by natural production declines and temporary production curtailments associated with a significant reduction in crude oil prices as a result of a decrease in demand attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe following table presents certain consolidated data and volume throughput for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nVolume throughput increased in 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to new well connection in the third quarter of 2020, partially offset by natural production declines.\n \u2022 $6.3 million of cash repayments on the SMPH Term loan; and \nPiceance Basin. The Grand River system provides midstream services for the Piceance Basin reportable segment. Volume throughput for our Piceance Basin reportable segment follows.\nWe rely primarily on internally generated cash flow as well as external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt, equity and preferred equity securities, and proceeds from asset divestitures to fund our capital expenditures. We believe that our Revolving Credit Facility, together with internally generated cash flow and access to debt or equity capital markets, will be adequate to finance our business for the next twelve months without adversely impacting our liquidity.\nVolume throughput for our Barnett Shale reportable segment follows.\n \u2022 $211.0 million of net borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility; \n \u2022 Production from U.S. shale plays; \n\nSegment adjusted EBITDA is used to assess:\n* Not considered meaningful\n\nOur business has been, and we expect our future business to continue to be, affected by the following key trends:\nWe seek to maximize the profitability of our operations in part by minimizing, to the extent appropriate, expenses directly tied to operating our assets. Direct labor costs, compression costs, ad valorem taxes, repair and non-capitalized maintenance costs, integrity management costs, utilities and contract services comprise the most significant portion of our operation and maintenance expense. Other than utilities expense, these expenses are largely independent of volumes delivered through our gathering systems but may fluctuate depending on the activities performed during a specific period.\nVolume throughput increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to new wells that came online in the fourth quarter of 2019 and through the first three quarters of 2020. In addition, volume throughput was impacted by an increase in temporary production curtailments, completion activity and other operational downtime associated with customers on existing pad sites.\noutstanding but undrawn irrevocable standby letter of credit. Based on covenant limits, our available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $105 million. There were no defaults or events of default during 2020, and as of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the financial covenants in the Revolving Credit Facility. Our total leverage ratio and senior secured leverage ratio (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) was 5.1 to 1.0 and 3.2 to 1.0, respectively, relative to maximum threshold limits of 5.75 to 1.0 and 3.5 to 1.0. Given further deterioration of market conditions, decreased drilling activity, the deferral of well completions from customers, limitations on our ability to access the capital markets at a competitive cost to fund our capital expenditures and, on a limited scale, temporary production curtailments, we could have total leverage and senior secured leverage ratios that are higher than the levels prescribed in the applicable indebtedness agreements. Adverse developments in our areas of operation could materially adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the Revolving Credit Facility and the issuance of the $4.1 million letter of credit.\nVolume throughput for the Ohio Gathering system in 2020 decreased compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of natural production declines on existing wells on the system, fewer well connections, temporary production shut-ins and was partially offset by the completion of new wells.\nrevenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following describes significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 $27.4 of net proceeds from the issuance of Subsidiary Series A Preferred Units. \nBarnett Shale. The DFW Midstream system provides our midstream services for the Barnett Shale reportable segment.\n \u2022 $26.5 million for cash paid in connection with the TL Restructuring; \nWe conduct and report our operations in the midstream energy industry through eight reportable segments: Utica Shale, Ohio Gathering, Williston Basin, DJ Basin, Permian Basin, Piceance Basin, Barnett Shale, and Marcellus Shale. Each of our reportable segments provides midstream services in a specific geographic area and our reportable segments reflect the way in which we internally report the financial information used to make decisions and allocate resources in connection with our operations (see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements). Our management uses a variety of financial and operational metrics to analyze our consolidated and segment performance and we view these metrics as important factors in evaluating our profitability. These metrics include (i) throughput volume, (ii) revenues, (iii) operation and maintenance expenses, and (iv) segment adjusted EBITDA.\nTotal Revenues. Total revenues attributable to Corporate and Other was due to gathering services, natural gas, and condensate sales. The decrease of $25.0 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to the wind down of our marketing group in 2020 as well as lower natural gas activity.\nWe also have indirect exposure to changes in commodity prices in that persistently low commodity prices may cause our customers to delay and/or cancel drilling and/or completion activities or temporarily shut-in production, which would reduce the volumes of natural gas and crude oil (and associated volumes of produced water) that we gather. If certain of our customers cancel or delay drilling and/or completion activities or temporarily shut-in production, the associated MVCs, if any, ensure that we will earn a minimum amount of revenue.\nTransaction costs. Transaction costs recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 are primarily related to costs associated with our liability management initiatives.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cash paid for capital expenditures totaled $43.1 million which included $14.1 million of maintenance capital expenditures. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we contributed $99.9 million to Double E.\nPermian Basin. The Summit Permian system provides our midstream services for the Permian Basin reportable segment. Volume throughput for our Permian Basin reportable segment follows.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. As of December 31, 2020, we had net property, plant and equipment with a carrying value of approximately $1.8 billion and net amortizing intangible assets with a carrying value of approximately $200.0 million. When evidence exists that we will not be able to recover a long-lived asset's carrying value through future cash flows, we write down the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value. We test assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. With respect to property, plant and equipment and our amortizing intangible assets, the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if the carrying value exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the asset's use and eventual disposal. In this situation, we would recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the asset's fair value. We determine fair value using a combination of approaches, including a market-based approach and an income-based approach in which we discount the asset's expected future cash flows to reflect the risk associated with achieving the underlying cash flows. Any impairment determinations involve significant assumptions and judgments. Differing assumptions regarding any of these inputs could have a significant effect on the various valuations. As such, the fair value measurements utilized within these estimates are classified as non-recurring Level 3 measurements in the fair value hierarchy because they are not observable from objective sources. Due to the volatility of the inputs used, we cannot predict the likelihood of any future impairment.\n* Not considered meaningful\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\n \u2022 net income of $189.1 million plus adjustments of $40.5 million for non-cash items; and \nFinancial data for our DJ Basin reportable segment follows.\nWe examine the creditworthiness of counterparties to whom we extend credit and manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, credit approval, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and for certain transactions, we may request letters of credit, prepayments or guarantees.\n \u2022 successful drilling activity within our AMIs; \nCorporate and Other represents those results that are not specifically attributable to a reportable segment or that have not been allocated to our reportable segments, including certain general and administrative expense items, natural gas and crude oil marketing services, transaction costs, interest expense and early extinguishment of debt.\nOperation and Maintenance Expenses\nRevenues\n \u2022 Summit Permian Transmission. In connection with the Double E Project, Summit Permian Transmission contributed total assets of approximately $23.6 million for a 70% ownership interest in Double E. Concurrent with this contribution, Double E distributed $7.3 million to the Partnership. \n \u2022 Capital markets availability and cost of capital; and \nIn addition, certain of our gathering systems are directly affected by crude oil supply and demand dynamics. Crude oil prices decreased in 2020, with the average daily Cushing, Oklahoma West Texas Intermediate crude oil spot price decreasing from an average $56.99 per barrel during 2019 to an average of $39.16 per barrel during 2020, representing a 31.3% decrease, reflecting broader market concerns for global oil supply and demand dynamics. In response to the general decrease in crude oil prices, the number of active crude oil drilling rigs in the continental United States decreased from 677 in December 2019 to 267 in December 2020, according to Baker Hughes. Over the next several years, we expect that crude oil prices will support continued drilling activity and increasing production in the Williston Basin, Permian Basin and, given the current regulatory environment in Colorado, in rural parts of the DJ Basin.\n\n\nCapital Requirements\n \u2022 a volume throughput increase of 14 MMcf/d for the Permian Basin segment. \nThe following table presents certain consolidated and reportable segment financial data. For additional information on our reportable segments, see the \"Segment Overview for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\u201d section herein.\nYear ended December 31, 2020. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $5.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of higher volumes throughput described above.\n \u2022 a $18.4 million decrease in gathering services and related fees in the Williston Basin primarily reflecting a decrease in gathering services and related fees attributable to the sale of the Tioga Midstream system on March 22, 2019, whose 2019 financial results are included for the period from January 1, 2019 through March 22, 2019 as well as lower liquids volume throughput, partially offset by the completion of new wells through 2019 and 2020. \n\nFinancial data for our Utica Shale reportable segment follows.\n(1) Includes the amortization expense associated with our favorable and unfavorable gas gathering contracts as reported in other revenues.\nGathering services and related fees. Gathering services and related fees decreased $24.0 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily reflecting:\nOn March 2, 2020, the SEC issued Final Rule Release No. 33-10762, Financial Disclosures about Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities and Affiliates Whose Securities Collateralize a Registrant's Securities ( Release 33-10762\u201d), that amends the disclosure requirements related to certain registered securities that are guaranteed and those that are collateralized by the securities of an affiliate.\nRate of growth in production from U.S. shale plays. Some of our producer customers have adjusted their drilling and completion activities and schedules to manage drilling and completion costs at levels that are achievable using internally generated cash flow from their underlying operations. Historically, as part of a strategy to accelerate production growth, these producers would raise external capital to fund drilling and completion costs in excess of the cash flows generated from their underlying assets. In general, we expect our producer customers to maintain moderate completion and production activities across many of our systems relative to our previous expectations as a result of the commodity price environment and a continuation of the general trend of producers constraining drilling and completion activity to levels that can be satisfied with internally generated cash flow.\n(1) See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" herein and Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital expenditures.\n\n* Not considered meaningful\nWe evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when we believe the current fair value may be less than the carrying amount and record an impairment if we believe the decline in value is other than temporary.\nCash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily reflected:\nYear ended December 31, 2020. Segment adjusted EBITDA decreased $10.9 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily related to the decreased volume throughput described above.\n\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expense attributable to Corporate and Other increased by $16.5 million, primarily related to a $17.0 million loss contingency accrual in 2020, see note 11 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n \u2022 $48.7 million in proceeds from the issuance of our Subsidiary Series A Preferred Units and; \n \u2022 $65.3 million payment on Term Loan B; and \n \u2022 a volume throughput increase of 5 MMcf/d for the Marcellus Shale segment. \nVolumes - Liquids.

Further details on our Focus Areas and Legacy Areas are summarized below.\n \u2022 our ability to gather, treat and/or process production that has been released from commitments with our competitors. \n \u2022 2020 Impairments. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded $8.6 million of impairments related to certain long-lived assets, of which $5.1 million related to a January 2021 sale of compressor equipment for a total cash purchase price of $8.0 million. \n \u2022 Core Focus Areas. Core producing areas of basins in which we expect our gathering systems to experience greater long-term growth, driven by our customers' ability to generate more favorable returns and support sustained drilling and completion activity in varying commodity price environments. In the near-term, we expect to concentrate the majority of our capital expenditures in our Core Focus Areas. Our Utica Shale, Ohio Gathering, Williston Basin, DJ Basin and Permian Basin reportable segments (as described below) comprise our Core Focus Areas. \n \u2022 a $4.6 million increase in gathering services and related fees in the Utica Shale primarily due to the completion of new wells throughout 2019, and in 2020, and a more favorable volume and gathering rate mix from customers, partially offset by natural production declines from existing wells. \n\nOhio Gathering. The Ohio Gathering reportable segment includes OGC and OCC. We account for our investment in Ohio Gathering using the equity method. We recognize our proportionate share of earnings or loss in net income on a one-month lag based on the financial information available to us during the reporting period.\nThe Partnership's cash flows generated from operations are also the primary source for funding various contractual obligations. The table below summarizes the Partnership's major commitments as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\n\n \u2022 a $31.2 million decrease in long-lived asset impairments in the DJ Basin in 2019. \nWe have exposure due to nonperformance under our MVC contracts whereby a customer, who was not meeting its MVCs, does not have the wherewithal to make its MVC shortfall payments when they become due. We typically receive payment for all prior-year MVC shortfall billings in the quarter immediately following billing. Therefore, our exposure to risk of nonperformance is limited to and accumulates during the current year-to-date contracted measurement period.\nFor additional information on our long-term debt, see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.\nGain on early extinguishment of debt. The $203.1 million gain on the early extinguishment of debt is primarily related to liability management initiatives undertaken during 2020 that resulted in a $86.4 million gain from the Open Market Repurchases, a $23.3 million gain from the Debt Tender Offers, and a $93.9 million gain from our TL Restructuring. Further details of our liability management results are summarized below.\nCash flows used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily reflected:\nDepreciation and amortization. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense during 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to the assets placed into service in the Permian Basin.\n \u2022 GP Buy-In Transaction. In May 2020, the Partnership completed the GP Buy-In Transaction whereby the Partnership acquired from its then private equity sponsor, ECP, (i) Summit Investments, which indirectly owned the Partnership's General Partner, (ii) through its ownership of SMP Holdings, 3,415,646 of its common units and (iii) a deferred purchase price obligation receivable owed by the Partnership. Consideration paid to ECP included a $35.0 million cash payment and warrants to purchase up to 666,667 common units. In connection with the closing of the GP Buy-In Transaction, ECP's management resigned from the Board of Directors and fully exited its investment in the Partnership (other than retaining the aforementioned warrants).

In December 2019, as part of our financing for the Double E Project, we formed Permian Holdco, a newly created, unrestricted subsidiary of SMLP that indirectly owns SMLP's 70% interest in Double E. In connection with the formation of Permian Holdco, we entered into an agreement with TPG Energy Solutions Anthem, L.P. ( TPG\u201d) on December 24, 2019 to fund up to $80 million of Permian Holdco's future capital calls associated with the Double E Project. Simultaneously, on December 24, 2019, Permian Holdco issued 30,000 Subsidiary Series A Preferred Units to TPG for net proceeds of $27.4 million. \n \u2022 Natural gas, NGL and crude oil supply and demand dynamics; \n \u2022 our ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells in the areas in which we operate outside of our existing AMIs; and \n \u2022 Legacy Areas. Production basins in which we expect volume throughput on our gathering systems to experience relatively lower long-term growth compared to our Core Focus Areas, given that our customers require relatively higher commodity prices to support drilling and completion activities in these basins. Upstream production served by our gathering systems in our Legacy Areas is generally more mature, as compared to our Core Focus Areas, and the decline rates for volume throughput on our gathering systems in the Legacy Areas are typically lower as a result. We expect to continue to decrease our near-term capital expenditures in these Legacy Areas. Our Piceance Basin, Barnett Shale and Marcellus Shale reportable segments (as described below) comprise our Legacy Areas. \n* Not considered meaningful\nLiquids. Liquids volume throughput in 2020 decreased compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily associated with natural production declines, deferral of completion activities, shut-ins and temporary production curtailments associated with a significant reduction in crude oil prices as a result of a decrease in demand attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the completion of new wells throughout 2019 and 2020.\n\nOperating activities. Details of cash flows from operating activities follow.\n \u2022 $41.8 million for the purchase of common units in the GP Buy-In Transaction; \nOngoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced demand and prices for oil. We are closely monitoring the impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 on all aspects of our business, including how it has impacted and will impact our customers, employees, supply chain and distribution network. We are unable to predict the ultimate impact that COVID-19 and related factors may have on our business, future results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Given the dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and related market conditions, we cannot reasonably estimate the period of time that these events will persist or the full extent of the impact they will have on our business. The extent to which our operations may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including changes in the severity of the pandemic, countermeasures taken by governments, businesses and individuals to slow the spread of the pandemic, and the development and availability of treatments and vaccines and the extent to which these treatments and vaccines may remain effective as potential new strains of the coronavirus emerge. Furthermore, the impacts of a potential worsening of global economic conditions and the continued disruptions to and volatility in the financial markets remain unknown.", "item_7_text": "Marcellus Shale.

In July 2014, Summit Holdings and its 100% owned finance subsidiary, Finance Corp. (together with Summit Holdings, the \"Co-Issuers\") co-issued $300.0 million of 5.5% senior unsecured notes maturing August 15, 2022 (the \"2022 Senior Notes\" and, together with the 2025 Senior Notes (defined below), the Senior Notes\u201d). As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance of the 2022 Senior Notes is $234.0 million. We pay interest on the 2022 Senior Notes semi-annually in cash in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The 2022 Senior Notes are senior, unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior obligations. The 2022 Senior Notes are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all secured indebtedness, to the extent of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The Co-Issuers may redeem all or part of the 2022 Senior Notes at a redemption price of 100.000%, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Debt issuance costs of $5.1 million are being amortized over the life of the 2022 Senior Notes. As of and during the year ended December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the financial covenants governing our 2022 Senior Notes.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental financial measure used by management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others.\n \u2022 a $14.2 million decrease in long-lived asset impairments relating to the sale of certain Red Rock Gathering system assets in the Piceance Basin in 2019. \nWe are a value-driven limited partnership focused on developing, owning and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets that are strategically located in unconventional resource basins, primarily shale formations, in the continental United States.\nCost of Natural Gas and NGLs. Cost of natural gas and NGLs attributable to Corporate and Other was due to natural gas, NGL and crude oil marketing services in 2019. The decrease of $26.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was attributable to the wind down of our marketing group in 2020.\n \u2022 $6.0 million of distributions offset by; \nInvesting activities. Details of cash flows from investing activities follow.\nShifts in operating costs and inflation. Throughout most of the last five years, high levels of crude oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities across the United States resulted in increased competition for personnel and equipment as well as higher prices for labor, supplies, equipment and other services. Beginning in 2015, this dynamic began to shift as prices for crude oil and natural gas-related services decreased in line with overall decline in demand for these goods and services. While we expect lower service-related costs in the near term, we expect that over the longer term, these costs will continue to have a high correlation to changes in the prevailing price of crude oil and natural gas.\n\nContractual Obligations Update\n\nOperation and maintenance. Operation and maintenance expense decreased $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\n \u2022 $18.3 million for investments in the Double E joint venture relating to the Double E Project; \nVolume throughput for the Marcellus Shale reportable segment follows.\nOur revenues are primarily attributable to the volumes that we gather, compress, treat and/or process and the rates we charge for those services. A majority of our gathering and processing agreements are fee-based, which limits our direct exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. We also have percent-of-proceeds arrangements with certain customers under which the gathering and processing revenues that we earn correlate directly with the fluctuating price of natural gas, condensate and NGLs.\n \u2022 maintenance capital expenditures, which are cash expenditures (including expenditures for the addition or improvement to, or the replacement of, our capital assets or for the acquisition of existing, or the construction or development of new, capital assets) made to maintain our long-term operating income or operating capacity; or \nFinancial data for our Permian Basin reportable segment follows.\n\nCredit and Counterparty Concentration Risks\n \u2022 Debt Tender Offers.

Upon completion of the Debt Tender Offers, the Co-Issuers repurchased $33.5 million principal amount of the 2022 Senior Notes and $38.7 million principal amount of the 2025 Senior Notes. Total cash consideration paid to repurchase the principal amounts outstanding of the 2022 and 2025 Senior Notes, plus accrued interest, totaled $48.7 million, and the Partnership recognized a $23.3 million gain on the extinguishment of debt related to the Debt Tender Offers during 2020. \nOverview\nWe report volumes gathered for natural gas in cubic feet per day. We aggregate crude oil and produced water gathering and report volumes gathered in barrels per day.\n \u2022 $182.3 million of capital expenditures primarily attributable to the ongoing development of the DJ Basin of $80.5 million, Summit Permian of $45.0 million, the Williston Basin of $30.9 million and Corporate and Other, which includes $17.7 million of capital expenditures relating to the Double E Project; \nFinancial data for our Williston Basin reportable segment follows.\nOur business is capital intensive, requiring significant investment for the maintenance of existing gathering systems and the acquisition or construction and development of new gathering systems and other midstream assets and facilities.

Details of cash flows from financing activities follow.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\n \u2022 a volume throughput increase of 85 MMcf/d for the Utica Shale segment. \nCorporate and Other Overview for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nCertain of our gathering and processing agreements contain MVCs pursuant to which our customers agree to ship or process a minimum volume of production on our gathering systems, or, in some cases, to pay a minimum monetary amount, over certain periods during the term of the MVC. These MVCs help us generate stable revenues and serve to mitigate the financial impact associated with declining volumes.\n \u2022 a volume throughput decrease of 39 MMcf/d for the Barnett Shale segment. \nCash flows used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily reflected:\n \u2022 $99.9 million of investments in our equity method investee; and \nNatural gas, NGL and crude oil supply and demand dynamics. Natural gas continues to be a critical component of energy supply and demand in the United States. The average spot price of natural gas decreased by approximately 21% from 2020 to 2019, primarily due to natural gas supply exceeding demand. The average daily Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price was $2.03 per MMBtu during 2020, compared with $2.56 per MMBtu during 2019. Henry Hub closed at $2.36 per MMBtu on December 31, 2020. As of February 18, 2021, Henry Hub 12-month strip pricing closed at $3.11 per MMBtu. Natural gas prices continue to trade at lower-than-average historical prices due in part to increased natural gas production and an elevated level of natural gas in storage in the continental United States. The average amount of working natural gas in underground storage in the continental U.S. was 3.05 Tcfe in 2020, which was 23.4% higher than in 2019. In the near term, we believe that until the supply of natural gas in storage has been reduced, natural gas prices are likely to remain constrained. Over the long term, we believe that the prospects for continued natural gas demand are favorable and will be driven primarily by global population and economic growth, as well as the continued displacement of coal-fired electricity generation by natural gas-fired electricity generation. However, we note that over the last several years there has been an increasing societal opposition to the production of hydrocarbons generally, which may be reflected in legislation, executive orders or regulations that may significantly restrict the domestic production of fossil fuels, including natural gas.\n\n \u2022 $43.1 million of capital expenditures primarily attributable to the ongoing development of our Williston, DJ, Utica and Permian segments. \nThe supplemental summarized financial information below reflects SMLP's separate accounts, the combined accounts of the Co-Issuers and the Guarantor Subsidiaries (the Co-Issuers and, together with the Guarantor Subsidiaries, the Obligor Group\u201d) for the dates and periods indicated. The financial information of the Obligor Group is presented on a combined basis and intercompany balances and transactions between the Co-Issuers and Guarantor Subsidiaries have been eliminated. There were no reportable transactions between the Co-Issuers and Obligor Group and the subsidiaries that were not issuers or guarantors of the Senior Notes.\n \u2022 $50.0 million increase in working capital accounts. \n \u2022 $25.0 million of cash paid for in connection with the Preferred Tender Offer; \nThroughput Volume\n \u2022 a $7.2 million decrease in gathering services and related fees in the Barnett Shale primarily reflecting $7.5 million in lower gas gathering revenue attributable to a MVC with a customer in 2019 that expired in 2020. \nCash flows used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily reflected:\n\nWilliston Basin.

The Utica Shale reportable segment includes the Summit Utica system. Volume throughput for our Summit Utica system follows.\nYear ended December 31, 2020. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $3.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the volume throughput previously discussed.\n \u2022 Disposition. In March 2019, we identified certain triggering events which indicated that certain long-lived assets in the DJ Basin and Barnett Shale reporting segments could be impaired. Consequently, we performed a recoverability assessment of certain assets within these reporting segments. In the DJ Basin, we determined certain processing plant assets related to our 20 MMcf/d plant would no longer be operational due to our expansion plans for the Niobrara G&P system and we recorded an impairment charge of $34.7 million related to these assets. In the Barnett Shale, we determined certain compressor station assets would be shut down and de-commissioned and we recorded an impairment charge of $9.7 million related to these assets. \nThe rules become effective January 4, 2021, with voluntary compliance permitted immediately. The Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by SMLP and the Guarantor Subsidiaries (see Note 9 - Debt). SMLP has concluded that it is eligible to provide Alternative Disclosures under the amended disclosure requirements and has early adopted Release 33-10762.\nOur financial results are driven primarily by volume throughput across our gathering systems and by expense management. We generate the majority of our revenues from the gathering, compression, treating and processing services that we provide to our customers. A majority of the volumes that we gather, compress, treat and/or process have a fixed-fee rate structure which enhances the stability of our cash flows by providing a revenue stream that is not subject to direct commodity price risk. We also earn a portion of our revenues from the following activities that directly expose us to fluctuations in commodity prices: (i) the sale of physical natural gas and/or NGLs purchased under percentage-of-proceeds or other processing arrangements with certain of our customers in the Williston Basin, Piceance Basin, and Permian Basin segments, (ii) the sale of natural gas we retain from certain Barnett Shale customers and (iii) the sale of condensate we retain from our gathering services in the Piceance Basin segment. During the year ended December 31, 2020, these additional activities accounted for approximately 13% of total revenues.\n \u2022 2019 Restructuring Costs. In the third quarter of 2019, we began an internal initiative to evaluate and transform our cost structure, enhance margins and improve our competitive position in response to a weakening commodity price backdrop. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred approximately $5.0 million in restructuring costs relating to this initiative (included in general and administrative expense). For the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred an additional $3.5 million related to this initiative. \n \u2022 the attractiveness of capital projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities; and \n \u2022 $145.6 million paid for open market repurchases of the 2022 and 2025 Notes; \nRevolving Credit Facility. We have a $1.1 billion senior secured Revolving Credit Facility with a maturity of May 2022 (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements). As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance of the Revolving Credit Facility was $857.0 million and the unused portion totaled $238.9 million, after giving effect to the issuance thereunder of a $4.1 million\nWe may enter into off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off-balance sheet obligations. As of December 31, 2020, our material off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions include (i) a parental guaranty issued on behalf of a wholly owned subsidiary to fund the subsidiary's pro rata share of required Double E Project construction related capital calls, with the wholly owned subsidiary having an estimated $172.4 million of remaining capital calls due for construction based on the Partnership's best estimate at December 31, 2020, (ii) letters of credit outstanding against our Revolving Credit Facility aggregating to $4.1 million, and (iii) outstanding surety bonds aggregating to $7.1 million. There are no other transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or availability of our capital resources.\n \u2022 TL Restructuring. In November 2020, the Partnership completed the TL Restructuring. All of the Term Loan Lenders participated in the TL Restructuring. As part of the TL Restructuring, the Partnership paid SMP Holdings $26.5 million in cash as consideration to fully settle the deferred purchase price obligation, which SMP Holdings then paid to the Term Loan Lenders. In addition, the Term Loan Lenders executed the Strict Foreclosure on the 2,306,972 common units pledged as collateral under the SMPH Term Loan in full satisfaction of SMP Holdings' outstanding obligations under the SMPH Term Loan. \n\n\n(1) Exclusive of volume throughput for Ohio Gathering. For additional information, see the \"Ohio Gathering\" section herein.\n \u2022 $35.0 million in proceeds from the ECP Loan. \nIn addition to the significant reduction in global demand for oil and natural gas caused by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were also volatile oil prices during 2020 largely due to a supply and demand imbalance and actions by members of OPEC and other foreign, oil-exporting countries. This disrupted the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry and other industries that serve exploration and production companies. These industry conditions, coupled with those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, could lead to significant global economic contraction generally and in our industry in particular.\n\n \u2022 $7.3 million for a distribution from an equity method investment. \nCertain of our customers may be temporarily unable to meet their current obligations. While this may cause disruption to cash flows, we believe that we are properly positioned to deal with the potential disruption because the vast majority of our gathering assets are strategically positioned at the beginning of the midstream value chain. The majority of our infrastructure is connected directly to our customers' wellheads and pad sites, which means our gathering systems are typically the first third-party infrastructure through which our customers' commodities flow and, in many cases, the only way for our customers to get their production to market.\nVolume throughput in 2020 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of new well connections in the fourth quarter of 2019 and through the first quarter of 2020, partially offset by natural production declines from wells previously in service.\nGrowth in production from U.S. shale plays. Over the past several years, natural gas production from unconventional shale resources has increased significantly due to advances in technology that allow producers to extract significant volumes of natural gas from unconventional shale plays on favorable economic terms relative to most conventional plays. In recent years, a number of producers and their joint venture partners, including large international operators, industrial manufacturers and private equity sponsors, have committed significant capital to the development of these unconventional resources, including the Piceance, Barnett, Bakken, Marcellus, Utica and Permian Basin shale plays in which we operate, and we believe that these long-term capital investments will support drilling activity in unconventional shale plays over the long term.\nInterest Expense. The decrease in interest expense in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily a result of our liability management initiatives which included our Open Market Repurchases and Tender Offers, partially offset by a higher outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility.\n \u2022 Shifts in operating costs and inflation. \nCash Flows\nPayments to holders of the Senior Notes are affected by the composition of and relationships among the Co-Issuers, the Guarantor Subsidiaries and Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, who are unrestricted subsidiaries of SMLP and are not issuers or guarantors of the Senior Notes. The assets of our unrestricted subsidiaries are not available to satisfy the demands of the holders of the Senior Notes. In addition, our unrestricted subsidiaries are subject to certain contractual restrictions related to the payment of dividends, and other rights in favor of their non-affiliated stakeholders, that limit their ability to satisfy the demands of the holders of the Senior Notes.\nFinancial data for our Ohio Gathering reportable segment, based on a one-month lag follows.\n\nFinancial data for our Piceance Basin reportable segment follows.\n \u2022 December 2020 Series A Preferred Unit Tender. On December 29, 2020, the Partnership completed the Preferred Tender Offer, whereby it accepted 75,075 Series A Preferred Units for a purchase price of $333.00 per Series A Preferred Unit and an aggregate purchase price of $25.0 million. Upon closing the Preferred Tender Offer, it eliminated $82.7 million of the Series A Preferred Unit liquidation preference due as of the settlement date, inclusive of $7.6 million of accrued distributions. \nYear ended December 31, 2020. Segment adjusted EBITDA decreased $17.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily associated with the decreased liquid volume throughput described above, and the sale of Tioga Midstream in March of 2019. The decrease was partially offset by the increased natural gas volume throughput described above.\n \u2022 $47.5 million paid for tender offer of 2022 and 2025 Senior Notes; \n\n \u2022 Suspension of common and preferred unit distributions. In May 2020, and in conjunction with the GP Buy-In Transaction, the Partnership suspended distributions to holders of its common units and its Series A Preferred Units, commencing with respect to the quarter ending March 31, 2020. The suspension of distributions enabled the Partnership to retain an incremental $76 million per annum of operating cash flow and reallocate this retained cash to indebtedness reduction, liability management transactions and other corporate initiatives. The unpaid cash distributions on the Series A Preferred Units continue to accrue semi-annually, until paid. \nVolumes - Gas. Natural gas throughput volumes decreased 22 MMcf/d for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily reflecting:\nVolume throughput decreased in 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 reflecting natural production declines partially offset by new volumes from well recompletion and workover activity throughout 2020.\n \u2022 the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; \nSummarized Statements of Operations Information. For the purposes of the following summarized statements of operations, we allocate a portion of general and administrative expenses recognized at the SMLP parent to the Obligor Group to reflect what those entities' results would have been had they operated on a stand-alone basis. Summarized statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 follow.\nYear ended December 31, 2020. Segment adjusted EBITDA for equity method investees decreased $8.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily related to lower volume throughput described above.\n* Not considered meaningful\n \u2022 Equity Method Investment Impairment. In December 2019, we identified certain triggering events which indicated that our equity method investment in Ohio Gathering could be impaired. We completed an other-than-temporary impairment analysis to determine the potential equity method impairment charge to be recorded on our consolidated financial statements. As a result, an impairment charge of approximately $329.7 million was recorded in the loss from equity method investees caption on the consolidated statement of operations. \n \u2022 Open Market Repurchase of Senior Notes. Throughout 2020, the Partnership completed its Open Market Repurchases, which resulted in the extinguishment of $32.4 million of face value of the 2022 Senior Notes and $201.8 million of face value of the 2025 Senior Notes. Total cash consideration paid to repurchase the principal amounts outstanding of the 2022 Senior Notes and 2025 Senior Notes, plus accrued interest totaled $150.3 million and the Partnership recognized a $86.4 million gain on the extinguishment of debt related to these Open Market Repurchases during 2020. \n \u2022 Tioga Midstream. Until March 22, 2019, we owned Tioga Midstream, a crude oil, produced water and associated natural gas gathering system in the Williston Basin. On March 22, 2019, we sold the Tioga Midstream system to affiliates of Hess Infrastructure Partners LP for a combined cash purchase price of approximately $90 million and recorded a gain on sale of $0.9 million based on the difference between the consideration received and the carrying value for Tioga Midstream at closing. The gain is included in the Gain on asset sales, net caption on the consolidated statement of operations. The financial results of Tioga Midstream (a component of the Williston Basin reportable segment) are included in our consolidated financial statements and footnotes for the historical periods through March 22, 2019. Refer to Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for details on the sale of Tioga Midstream. \nCost of natural gas and NGLs. Cost of natural gas and NGLs decreased $26.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by lower natural gas, NGL and crude oil marketing activity.\n* Not considered meaningful\nMD&A is intended to inform the reader about matters affecting the financial condition and results of operations of the Partnership and its subsidiaries. As a result, the following discussion for the year ended December 31, 2020 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Annual Report. Among other things, the consolidated financial statements and the related notes include more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following information. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that constitute our plans, estimates and beliefs. These forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those discussed in Forward-Looking Statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. The discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 included in Exhibit 99.2, Updated 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Form 8-K dated August 7, 2020, is incorporated by reference into this MD&A.\n\n* Not considered meaningful\n*Not considered meaningful\n \u2022 the level of work-overs and recompletions of wells on existing pad sites to which our gathering systems are connected; \n \u2022 a volume throughput decrease of 88 MMcf/d for the Piceance Basin segment. \nKey Matters for the Year ended December 31, 2019. The following items are reflected in our financial results for the fiscal year ended 2019:\nDJ Basin. The Niobrara G&P system provides midstream services for the DJ Basin reportable segment. Volume throughput for our DJ Basin reportable segment follows.\n \u2022 expansion capital expenditures, which are cash expenditures incurred for acquisitions or capital improvements that we expect will increase our operating income or operating capacity over the long term. \n\nFinancial data for our Barnett Shale reportable segment follows.\nYear ended December 31, 2020. Segment adjusted EBITDA decreased $9.9 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily associated with the volume throughput decrease described above, and a decrease in operations and maintenance expense primarily due to lower compensation expense associated with lower headcount from our cost cutting initiatives.\ncontinued volatility in market conditions since March 2020, and based on recently updated production forecasts and 2021 development plans from our customers, we currently expect our 2021 results to be affected by decreased drilling activity.\nConsolidated Overview for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \u2022 a $14.7 million decrease in gathering services and related fees in the Piceance Basin relating to lower volume throughput due to a lack of drilling and completion activity and natural production declines. \n \u2022 Double E Project. For the year ended December 2020, the Partnership's proportionate share of capital calls due in 2020 totaled $99.9 million, which includes $2.7 million in capitalized interest, and was funded with $20.6 million of Partnership generated funds and the issuance of $85.3 million of Subsidiary Series A Preferred Units. \n \u2022 $89.5 million of net proceeds from the Tioga Midstream sale and $12.0 million of proceeds from the Red Rock Gathering sale; and \nWith the completion of our 60 MMcf/d DJ Basin processing plant and compression expansions in the Permian Basin, capital expenditures began to decline in the third and fourth quarter of 2019 and continued throughout 2020. We will remain disciplined with respect to future capital expenditures, which will be primarily concentrated on the Double E Project and accretive expansions of our existing systems in our Core Focus Areas. We continue to advance our financing plans for our equity interest in Double E, which we intend to be credit positive to Summit. We are currently targeting a financing structure that limits cash payments by us during 2021, and which shifts a substantial majority of our Double E capital commitments to third parties, including commercial banks. On December 24, 2019, we entered into an agreement with TPG to fund up to $80.0 million of Permian Holdco's future capital calls associated with the Double E Project. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Permian Holdco issued 55,251 and 30,000 Subsidiary Series A Preferred Units to TPG for net proceeds of $48.7 million and $27.4 million, respectively.\nSummarized Financial Information\n\nWe depend primarily on funds generated from our operations, our Revolving Credit Facility, our cash and cash equivalents balance, and capital markets as our primary sources of liquidity. Looking forward to 2021, we will seek to reduce indebtedness and extend our indebtedness maturities. As a result, we expect to fund future expenditures from cash generated by our operations, our Revolving Credit Facility, our cash equivalents on hand. If optimal, we may also consider accessing the capital markets, opportunistic divestitures or joint ventures involving our existing midstream assets.\n \u2022 July 2020 Series A Preferred Unit Exchange. In July 2020, the Partnership completed the Preferred Exchange Offer, whereby it issued 837,547 SMLP common units in exchange for 62,816 Series A Preferred Units. Upon closing the Preferred Exchange Offer, it eliminated $66.5 million of the Series A Preferred Unit liquidation preference amount, inclusive of $3.7 million of accrued distributions due as of the settlement date. \nDebt\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have modified our business practices, including restricting employee travel, modifying employee work locations, implementing social distancing and enhancing sanitary measures in our facilities. Many of our suppliers, vendors and service providers have made similar modifications. The resources available to employees working remotely may not enable them to maintain the same level of productivity and efficiency, and these and other employees may face additional demands on their time. Our increased reliance on remote access to our information systems increases our exposure to potential cybersecurity breaches. We may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, in which case our employees may become sick, our ability to perform critical functions could be impaired, and we may be unable to respond to the needs of our business. The resumption of normal business operations after such interruptions may be delayed or constrained by lingering effects of COVID-19 on our suppliers, third-party service providers, and/or customers.\n \u2022 Double E Project. In June 2019, we continued development of the Double E Project after securing firm 10-year commitments under binding precedent agreements for a substantial majority of the pipeline's initial throughput capacity of 1.35 Bcf of gas per day and executing the joint venture agreement (described below) with an affiliate of Double E's foundation shipper. The Double E Project, which consists of an approximately 116-mile mainline and related facilities, will provide interstate natural gas transportation service from the Delaware Basin production area to the Waha Hub in Texas. \nThe discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities,\nThe volume of (i) natural gas that we gather, compress, treat and/or process and (ii) crude oil and produced water that we gather depends on the level of production from natural gas or crude oil wells connected to our gathering systems. Aggregate production volumes are impacted by the overall amount of drilling and completion activity. Furthermore, because the production rate of natural gas and crude oil wells decline over time, production can only be maintained or increased by new drilling or other activity.\nKey Matters for the Year ended December 31, 2020. The following items are reflected in our financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020:\n \u2022 our operating performance and return on capital as compared to other companies in the midstream energy sector, without regard to financing or capital structure; \nVolume throughput decreased in 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of natural production declines.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased $13.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of our liability management initiatives which included our Open Market Repurchases and Tender Offers, partially offset by a higher outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility.\n \u2022 other changes in working capital. \nCapital markets availability and cost of capital. Credit markets were volatile throughout 2019, as borrowing costs increased and investors assessed the impact of rising rates on broader economic activity. Capital markets conditions, including but not limited to availability and higher borrowing costs, could affect our ability to access the debt capital markets to the extent necessary, to fund our future growth. Furthermore, market demand for equity issued by master limited partnerships has been significantly lower in recent years than it has been historically, which may make it more challenging for us to finance our capital expenditures with the issuance of additional equity. We announced the elimination of our common unit distribution in May 2020 beginning with the distribution paid in respect of the second quarter of 2020, and this action may further reduce demand for our common units. In addition, interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly.\n \u2022 Goodwill Impairment. In September 2019, in connection with our annual impairment evaluation, we determined that the fair value of the Mountaineer Midstream reporting unit did not exceed its carrying value and we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $16.2 million. \n \u2022 $35.0 million for the repayment of the ECP Loan; \n\n (1) The Partnership issued a parental guaranty on behalf of its wholly owned subsidiary to fund the subsidiary's pro rata share of required Double E construction project capital calls. As of December 31, 2020, this amount represents the Partnership's best estimate of its remaining obligation to fund Double E for the construction of the Double E Project. \nRevenues. Total revenues decreased $60.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year primarily comprised of a $24.0 million decrease in gathering services and related fees and a $37.7 million decrease in natural gas, NGLs and condensate sales.\nThere are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our current expectations to change, including, but not limited to, (i) the ability to reach agreement with third parties; (ii) prevailing conditions and outlook in the natural gas, crude oil and NGL industries and markets and (iii) our ability to obtain financing from commercial banks, the capital markets, or other financing sources.\nWe estimate that our 2021 capital program will range from $20.0 million to $35.0 million, including approximately $10.0 million of maintenance capital expenditures.\nTrends and Outlook\n \u2022 the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to make cash distributions and support our indebtedness; \n \u2022 Ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced demand and prices for oil; \nNatural gas. Natural gas volume throughput in 2020 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily reflecting the completion of new wells behind the Bison Midstream system in the fourth quarter of 2019 and through 2020 partially offset by natural production declines and the sale of Tioga Midstream.\nGain on Early Extinguishment of Debt. The gain on the early extinguishment of debt is primarily related to liability management initiatives undertaken during 2020 that resulted in a $86.4 million gain from the Open Market Repurchases, a $23.3 million gain from the Debt Tender Offers, and a $93.9 million gain from our TL Restructuring.\nOver the past several months, we have collaborated extensively with our customer base regarding production reductions and delays to drilling and completion activities in light of the current commodity price backdrop and COVID-19 pandemic. Given\n \u2022 2020 Restructuring Costs. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we completed an internal initiative to evaluate and transform our cost structure, enhance margins and improve our competitive position in response to COVID-19 and the related weakening of the economy. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred approximately $5.6 million in restructuring costs relating to this initiative (included in general and administrative expense). \nYear ended December 31, 2020. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $0.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily associated with a more favorable volume and gathering rate mix from customers.\nThe components of the net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were as follows:\n \u2022 a $6.5 million increase in gathering services and related fees in the Permian Basin primarily as a result of an uptick in customer volumes, partially offset by natural production declines from wells previously put in service. \nGross volume throughput for Ohio Gathering, based on a one-month lag follows.\nYear ended December 31, 2020. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $2.0 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily associated with the increased volume throughput described above.\nAdjustments for MVC Shortfall Payments. For our calculation of segment adjusted EBITDA, we estimate the impact of expected MVC shortfall payments based on assumptions that include, but are not limited to, contract terms, historical volume throughput data, and expectations regarding future investment expenditures, customer drilling activities, and customer production volumes.\n2025 Senior Notes. In February 2017, the Co-Issuers co-issued $500.0 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes maturing April 15, 2025 (the 2025 Senior Notes\u201d). As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance of the 2025 Senior Notes was $259.5 million. We pay interest on the 2025 Senior Notes semi-annually in cash in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year. The 2025 Senior Notes are senior, unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior obligations. The 2025 Senior Notes are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all of our secured indebtedness, to the extent of the collateral securing such indebtedness.\n \u2022 Red Rock. In December 2019, Red Rock Gathering and certain affiliates of SMLP (collectively, the Red Rock Parties\u201d) entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Red Rock PSA\u201d) pursuant to which the Red Rock Parties agreed to sell certain Red Rock Gathering system assets for a cash purchase price of $12.0 million (the Red Rock Sale\u201d). Prior to closing, we recorded an impairment charge of $14.2 million based on the expected consideration and the carrying value for the Red Rock Gathering system assets. On December 2, 2019, we closed the Red Rock Sale. The impairment is included in the Long-lived asset impairment caption on the consolidated statement of operations. The financial contribution of these assets (a component of the Piceance Basin reportable segment) are included in our consolidated financial statements and footnotes for the period from January 1, 2019 through December 1, 2019. \nAdditional Information. For additional information, see the \"Results of Operations\" section herein and the notes to the consolidated financial statements. For information on pending accounting changes that are expected to materially impact our financial results reported in future periods, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 a $16.2 million decrease in goodwill impairment charge relating to the Mountaineer Midstream system in the Marcellus Basin in 2019. \nCosts and expenses. Total costs and expenses decreased $76.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily reflecting:\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nResults of Operations\nThe Co-Issuers may redeem all or part of the 2025 Senior Notes at a redemption price of 104.313% (with the redemption price declining ratably each April 15 to 100.000% on April 15, 2023), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. Debt issuance costs of $7.7 million are being amortized over the life of the 2025 Senior Notes. As of and during the year ended December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the financial covenants governing our 2025 Senior Notes.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nCash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily reflected:\nA list of each of SMLP's subsidiaries that is a guarantor, issuer or co-issuer of our registered securities subject to the reporting requirements in Release 33-10762 is filed as Exhibit 22.1 to this Annual Report.\n \u2022 a $1.9 million increase in gathering services and related fees in the DJ Basin primarily as a result of ongoing drilling and completion activity across our service area, a more favorable volume and gathering rate mix from customers and the commissioning of our new natural gas processing plant in June 2019, partially offset by natural production declines and temporary production curtailments associated with a significant reduction in crude oil prices as a result of a decrease in demand attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe following table presents certain consolidated data and volume throughput for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nVolume throughput increased in 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to new well connection in the third quarter of 2020, partially offset by natural production declines.\n \u2022 $6.3 million of cash repayments on the SMPH Term loan; and \nPiceance Basin. The Grand River system provides midstream services for the Piceance Basin reportable segment. Volume throughput for our Piceance Basin reportable segment follows.\nWe rely primarily on internally generated cash flow as well as external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt, equity and preferred equity securities, and proceeds from asset divestitures to fund our capital expenditures. We believe that our Revolving Credit Facility, together with internally generated cash flow and access to debt or equity capital markets, will be adequate to finance our business for the next twelve months without adversely impacting our liquidity.\nVolume throughput for our Barnett Shale reportable segment follows.\n \u2022 $211.0 million of net borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility; \n \u2022 Production from U.S. shale plays; \n\nSegment adjusted EBITDA is used to assess:\n* Not considered meaningful\n\nOur business has been, and we expect our future business to continue to be, affected by the following key trends:\nWe seek to maximize the profitability of our operations in part by minimizing, to the extent appropriate, expenses directly tied to operating our assets. Direct labor costs, compression costs, ad valorem taxes, repair and non-capitalized maintenance costs, integrity management costs, utilities and contract services comprise the most significant portion of our operation and maintenance expense. Other than utilities expense, these expenses are largely independent of volumes delivered through our gathering systems but may fluctuate depending on the activities performed during a specific period.\nVolume throughput increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to new wells that came online in the fourth quarter of 2019 and through the first three quarters of 2020. In addition, volume throughput was impacted by an increase in temporary production curtailments, completion activity and other operational downtime associated with customers on existing pad sites.\noutstanding but undrawn irrevocable standby letter of credit. Based on covenant limits, our available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $105 million. There were no defaults or events of default during 2020, and as of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the financial covenants in the Revolving Credit Facility. Our total leverage ratio and senior secured leverage ratio (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) was 5.1 to 1.0 and 3.2 to 1.0, respectively, relative to maximum threshold limits of 5.75 to 1.0 and 3.5 to 1.0. Given further deterioration of market conditions, decreased drilling activity, the deferral of well completions from customers, limitations on our ability to access the capital markets at a competitive cost to fund our capital expenditures and, on a limited scale, temporary production curtailments, we could have total leverage and senior secured leverage ratios that are higher than the levels prescribed in the applicable indebtedness agreements. Adverse developments in our areas of operation could materially adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the Revolving Credit Facility and the issuance of the $4.1 million letter of credit.\nVolume throughput for the Ohio Gathering system in 2020 decreased compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of natural production declines on existing wells on the system, fewer well connections, temporary production shut-ins and was partially offset by the completion of new wells.\nrevenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following describes significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 $27.4 of net proceeds from the issuance of Subsidiary Series A Preferred Units. \nBarnett Shale. The DFW Midstream system provides our midstream services for the Barnett Shale reportable segment.\n \u2022 $26.5 million for cash paid in connection with the TL Restructuring; \nWe conduct and report our operations in the midstream energy industry through eight reportable segments: Utica Shale, Ohio Gathering, Williston Basin, DJ Basin, Permian Basin, Piceance Basin, Barnett Shale, and Marcellus Shale. Each of our reportable segments provides midstream services in a specific geographic area and our reportable segments reflect the way in which we internally report the financial information used to make decisions and allocate resources in connection with our operations (see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements). Our management uses a variety of financial and operational metrics to analyze our consolidated and segment performance and we view these metrics as important factors in evaluating our profitability. These metrics include (i) throughput volume, (ii) revenues, (iii) operation and maintenance expenses, and (iv) segment adjusted EBITDA.\nTotal Revenues. Total revenues attributable to Corporate and Other was due to gathering services, natural gas, and condensate sales. The decrease of $25.0 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to the wind down of our marketing group in 2020 as well as lower natural gas activity.\nWe also have indirect exposure to changes in commodity prices in that persistently low commodity prices may cause our customers to delay and/or cancel drilling and/or completion activities or temporarily shut-in production, which would reduce the volumes of natural gas and crude oil (and associated volumes of produced water) that we gather. If certain of our customers cancel or delay drilling and/or completion activities or temporarily shut-in production, the associated MVCs, if any, ensure that we will earn a minimum amount of revenue.\nTransaction costs. Transaction costs recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 are primarily related to costs associated with our liability management initiatives.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cash paid for capital expenditures totaled $43.1 million which included $14.1 million of maintenance capital expenditures. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we contributed $99.9 million to Double E.\nPermian Basin. The Summit Permian system provides our midstream services for the Permian Basin reportable segment. Volume throughput for our Permian Basin reportable segment follows.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. As of December 31, 2020, we had net property, plant and equipment with a carrying value of approximately $1.8 billion and net amortizing intangible assets with a carrying value of approximately $200.0 million. When evidence exists that we will not be able to recover a long-lived asset's carrying value through future cash flows, we write down the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value. We test assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. With respect to property, plant and equipment and our amortizing intangible assets, the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if the carrying value exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the asset's use and eventual disposal. In this situation, we would recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the asset's fair value. We determine fair value using a combination of approaches, including a market-based approach and an income-based approach in which we discount the asset's expected future cash flows to reflect the risk associated with achieving the underlying cash flows. Any impairment determinations involve significant assumptions and judgments. Differing assumptions regarding any of these inputs could have a significant effect on the various valuations. As such, the fair value measurements utilized within these estimates are classified as non-recurring Level 3 measurements in the fair value hierarchy because they are not observable from objective sources. Due to the volatility of the inputs used, we cannot predict the likelihood of any future impairment.\n* Not considered meaningful\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\n \u2022 net income of $189.1 million plus adjustments of $40.5 million for non-cash items; and \nFinancial data for our DJ Basin reportable segment follows.\nWe examine the creditworthiness of counterparties to whom we extend credit and manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, credit approval, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and for certain transactions, we may request letters of credit, prepayments or guarantees.\n \u2022 successful drilling activity within our AMIs; \nCorporate and Other represents those results that are not specifically attributable to a reportable segment or that have not been allocated to our reportable segments, including certain general and administrative expense items, natural gas and crude oil marketing services, transaction costs, interest expense and early extinguishment of debt.\nOperation and Maintenance Expenses\nRevenues\n \u2022 Summit Permian Transmission. In connection with the Double E Project, Summit Permian Transmission contributed total assets of approximately $23.6 million for a 70% ownership interest in Double E. Concurrent with this contribution, Double E distributed $7.3 million to the Partnership. \n \u2022 Capital markets availability and cost of capital; and \nIn addition, certain of our gathering systems are directly affected by crude oil supply and demand dynamics. Crude oil prices decreased in 2020, with the average daily Cushing, Oklahoma West Texas Intermediate crude oil spot price decreasing from an average $56.99 per barrel during 2019 to an average of $39.16 per barrel during 2020, representing a 31.3% decrease, reflecting broader market concerns for global oil supply and demand dynamics. In response to the general decrease in crude oil prices, the number of active crude oil drilling rigs in the continental United States decreased from 677 in December 2019 to 267 in December 2020, according to Baker Hughes. Over the next several years, we expect that crude oil prices will support continued drilling activity and increasing production in the Williston Basin, Permian Basin and, given the current regulatory environment in Colorado, in rural parts of the DJ Basin.\n\n\nCapital Requirements\n \u2022 a volume throughput increase of 14 MMcf/d for the Permian Basin segment. \nThe following table presents certain consolidated and reportable segment financial data. For additional information on our reportable segments, see the \"Segment Overview for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\u201d section herein.\nYear ended December 31, 2020. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $5.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of higher volumes throughput described above.\n \u2022 a $18.4 million decrease in gathering services and related fees in the Williston Basin primarily reflecting a decrease in gathering services and related fees attributable to the sale of the Tioga Midstream system on March 22, 2019, whose 2019 financial results are included for the period from January 1, 2019 through March 22, 2019 as well as lower liquids volume throughput, partially offset by the completion of new wells through 2019 and 2020. \n\nFinancial data for our Utica Shale reportable segment follows.\n(1) Includes the amortization expense associated with our favorable and unfavorable gas gathering contracts as reported in other revenues.\nGathering services and related fees. Gathering services and related fees decreased $24.0 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily reflecting:\nOn March 2, 2020, the SEC issued Final Rule Release No. 33-10762, Financial Disclosures about Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities and Affiliates Whose Securities Collateralize a Registrant's Securities ( Release 33-10762\u201d), that amends the disclosure requirements related to certain registered securities that are guaranteed and those that are collateralized by the securities of an affiliate.\nRate of growth in production from U.S. shale plays. Some of our producer customers have adjusted their drilling and completion activities and schedules to manage drilling and completion costs at levels that are achievable using internally generated cash flow from their underlying operations. Historically, as part of a strategy to accelerate production growth, these producers would raise external capital to fund drilling and completion costs in excess of the cash flows generated from their underlying assets. In general, we expect our producer customers to maintain moderate completion and production activities across many of our systems relative to our previous expectations as a result of the commodity price environment and a continuation of the general trend of producers constraining drilling and completion activity to levels that can be satisfied with internally generated cash flow.\n(1) See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" herein and Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital expenditures.\n\n* Not considered meaningful\nWe evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when we believe the current fair value may be less than the carrying amount and record an impairment if we believe the decline in value is other than temporary.\nCash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily reflected:\nYear ended December 31, 2020. Segment adjusted EBITDA decreased $10.9 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily related to the decreased volume throughput described above.\n\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expense attributable to Corporate and Other increased by $16.5 million, primarily related to a $17.0 million loss contingency accrual in 2020, see note 11 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n \u2022 $48.7 million in proceeds from the issuance of our Subsidiary Series A Preferred Units and; \n \u2022 $65.3 million payment on Term Loan B; and \n \u2022 a volume throughput increase of 5 MMcf/d for the Marcellus Shale segment. \nVolumes - Liquids. Crude oil and produced water throughput volumes at the Williston segment decreased 26 Mbbl/d for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nUnder Release 33-10762, an SEC registrant may continue to omit separate financial statements of subsidiary issuers and guarantors when (1) the subsidiary issuer is consolidated with the parent company and its security is either (a) co-issued jointly and severally with the parent company's security or (b) the subsidiary issuer's security is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the parent company and (2) the parent company provides supplemental financial and non-financial disclosure about the subsidiary issuers and/or guarantors and the guarantees.\nWe classify our midstream energy infrastructure assets into two categories, our Core Focus Areas and our Legacy Areas. Further details on our Focus Areas and Legacy Areas are summarized below.\n \u2022 our ability to gather, treat and/or process production that has been released from commitments with our competitors. \n \u2022 2020 Impairments. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded $8.6 million of impairments related to certain long-lived assets, of which $5.1 million related to a January 2021 sale of compressor equipment for a total cash purchase price of $8.0 million. \n \u2022 Core Focus Areas. Core producing areas of basins in which we expect our gathering systems to experience greater long-term growth, driven by our customers' ability to generate more favorable returns and support sustained drilling and completion activity in varying commodity price environments. In the near-term, we expect to concentrate the majority of our capital expenditures in our Core Focus Areas. Our Utica Shale, Ohio Gathering, Williston Basin, DJ Basin and Permian Basin reportable segments (as described below) comprise our Core Focus Areas. \n \u2022 a $4.6 million increase in gathering services and related fees in the Utica Shale primarily due to the completion of new wells throughout 2019, and in 2020, and a more favorable volume and gathering rate mix from customers, partially offset by natural production declines from existing wells. \n\nOhio Gathering. The Ohio Gathering reportable segment includes OGC and OCC. We account for our investment in Ohio Gathering using the equity method. We recognize our proportionate share of earnings or loss in net income on a one-month lag based on the financial information available to us during the reporting period.\nThe Partnership's cash flows generated from operations are also the primary source for funding various contractual obligations. The table below summarizes the Partnership's major commitments as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\n\n \u2022 a $31.2 million decrease in long-lived asset impairments in the DJ Basin in 2019. \nWe have exposure due to nonperformance under our MVC contracts whereby a customer, who was not meeting its MVCs, does not have the wherewithal to make its MVC shortfall payments when they become due. We typically receive payment for all prior-year MVC shortfall billings in the quarter immediately following billing. Therefore, our exposure to risk of nonperformance is limited to and accumulates during the current year-to-date contracted measurement period.\nFor additional information on our long-term debt, see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.\nGain on early extinguishment of debt. The $203.1 million gain on the early extinguishment of debt is primarily related to liability management initiatives undertaken during 2020 that resulted in a $86.4 million gain from the Open Market Repurchases, a $23.3 million gain from the Debt Tender Offers, and a $93.9 million gain from our TL Restructuring. Further details of our liability management results are summarized below.\nCash flows used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily reflected:\nDepreciation and amortization. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense during 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to the assets placed into service in the Permian Basin.\n \u2022 GP Buy-In Transaction. In May 2020, the Partnership completed the GP Buy-In Transaction whereby the Partnership acquired from its then private equity sponsor, ECP, (i) Summit Investments, which indirectly owned the Partnership's General Partner, (ii) through its ownership of SMP Holdings, 3,415,646 of its common units and (iii) a deferred purchase price obligation receivable owed by the Partnership. Consideration paid to ECP included a $35.0 million cash payment and warrants to purchase up to 666,667 common units. In connection with the closing of the GP Buy-In Transaction, ECP's management resigned from the Board of Directors and fully exited its investment in the Partnership (other than retaining the aforementioned warrants). Refer to Note 1 - Organization, Business Operations and Presentation and Consolidation for details. \n \u2022 $180.0 million of net proceeds from borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility; \n \u2022 the financial performance of our assets without regard to (i) income or loss from equity method investees, (ii) the impact of the timing of MVC shortfall payments under our gathering agreements or (iii) the timing of impairments or other noncash income or expense items. \nVolume throughput in 2020 decreased compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of natural production declines, shut-ins and fewer well connection through 2020.\n \u2022 Double E Financing. In December 2019, as part of our financing for the Double E Project, we formed Permian Holdco, a newly created, unrestricted subsidiary of SMLP that indirectly owns SMLP's 70% interest in Double E. In connection with the formation of Permian Holdco, we entered into an agreement with TPG Energy Solutions Anthem, L.P. ( TPG\u201d) on December 24, 2019 to fund up to $80 million of Permian Holdco's future capital calls associated with the Double E Project. Simultaneously, on December 24, 2019, Permian Holdco issued 30,000 Subsidiary Series A Preferred Units to TPG for net proceeds of $27.4 million. \n \u2022 Natural gas, NGL and crude oil supply and demand dynamics; \n \u2022 our ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells in the areas in which we operate outside of our existing AMIs; and \n \u2022 Legacy Areas. Production basins in which we expect volume throughput on our gathering systems to experience relatively lower long-term growth compared to our Core Focus Areas, given that our customers require relatively higher commodity prices to support drilling and completion activities in these basins. Upstream production served by our gathering systems in our Legacy Areas is generally more mature, as compared to our Core Focus Areas, and the decline rates for volume throughput on our gathering systems in the Legacy Areas are typically lower as a result. We expect to continue to decrease our near-term capital expenditures in these Legacy Areas. Our Piceance Basin, Barnett Shale and Marcellus Shale reportable segments (as described below) comprise our Legacy Areas. \n* Not considered meaningful\nLiquids. Liquids volume throughput in 2020 decreased compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily associated with natural production declines, deferral of completion activities, shut-ins and temporary production curtailments associated with a significant reduction in crude oil prices as a result of a decrease in demand attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the completion of new wells throughout 2019 and 2020.\n\nOperating activities. Details of cash flows from operating activities follow.\n \u2022 $41.8 million for the purchase of common units in the GP Buy-In Transaction; \nOngoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced demand and prices for oil. We are closely monitoring the impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 on all aspects of our business, including how it has impacted and will impact our customers, employees, supply chain and distribution network. We are unable to predict the ultimate impact that COVID-19 and related factors may have on our business, future results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Given the dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and related market conditions, we cannot reasonably estimate the period of time that these events will persist or the full extent of the impact they will have on our business. The extent to which our operations may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including changes in the severity of the pandemic, countermeasures taken by governments, businesses and individuals to slow the spread of the pandemic, and the development and availability of treatments and vaccines and the extent to which these treatments and vaccines may remain effective as potential new strains of the coronavirus emerge. Furthermore, the impacts of a potential worsening of global economic conditions and the continued disruptions to and volatility in the financial markets remain unknown.", "item_7_tables": "Table 312:
