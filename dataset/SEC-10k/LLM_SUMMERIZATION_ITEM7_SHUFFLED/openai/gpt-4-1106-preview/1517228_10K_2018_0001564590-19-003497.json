This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under \"Risk Factors\" included in Part I, Item 1A or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a global provider of infrastructure solutions for communication networks. Our solutions and services for wired and wireless networks enable high-bandwidth data, video and voice applications. Our portfolio includes innovative wireless and fiber optic solutions for today's evolving digital lifestyle. Our global leadership position is built upon innovative technology, broad solution offerings, high-quality and cost-effective customer solutions and global manufacturing and distribution scale. Our talented and experienced global team helps customers increase bandwidth; maximize existing capacity; improve network response time and performance; and simplify technology migration. Our solutions are found in some of the largest venues and outdoor spaces; in buildings and data centers of all sizes and complexities; at wireless cell sites; in telecom central offices and cable headends; in fiber-to-the-X (FTTX) deployments; and in airports, trains, and tunnels. Vital networks around the world run on CommScope solutions.\nOn November 8, 2018, we announced that we have entered into an agreement to acquire ARRIS International plc (ARRIS) (the Pending Acquisition) in an all cash transaction with a total purchase price of approximately $7.4 billion, or $31.75 per outstanding ARRIS share. We expect the transaction to close during the first half of 2019. See Part I, Item 1, Business-Strategy-ARRIS Acquisition Rationale\u201d for a discussion of strategy behind the acquisition of ARRIS and see Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors-ARRIS Acquisition Risks\u201d for a discussion of risks related to the pending acquisition of ARRIS.\nTo fund the Pending Acquisition, on February 19, 2019 we issued $1.25 billion of 5.50% senior secured notes due 2024, $1.5 billion of 6.00% senior secured notes due 2026 and $1.0 billion of 8.25% senior unsecured notes due 2027 and priced the borrowing of $3.2 billion under a new senior secured term loan due 2026 with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.25%. The proceeds of the notes were placed into escrow and will be released upon consummation of the Pending Acquisition, and it is expected that the new senior secured term loan will be borrowed at closing of the Pending Acquisition. We expect to use a portion of the new senior secured term loan to pay off our existing senior secured term loan due December 2022. We also expect to enter into a new asset-based revolving credit facility in an amount of up to $1.0 billion, subject to borrowing base capacity. In addition to the new debt, we expect to fund the Pending Acquisition by issuing 1.0 million shares of series A convertible preferred stock to the Carlyle Group for $1,000 per share, or an aggregate investment of $1.0 billion.\nThe following is a summary of our results for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year:\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Net sales were essentially flat with an increase of less than 1%;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Operating income decreased 4.7%;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Non-GAAP adjusted operating income decreased 4.4%;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA decreased 4.7%;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Net income decreased 27.7%; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Diluted earnings per share decreased 26.5%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe report financial performance based on two operating segments: CommScope Connectivity Solutions (CCS) and CommScope Mobility Solutions (CMS). For an overview of our operating segments, see Part I, Item I Business - Operating Segments.\u201d\nOur future financial condition and performance will be largely dependent upon: global spending by wireless operators; global spending by business enterprises on information technology; investment by cable operators and communications companies in video and communications infrastructure; overall global business conditions; and our ability to manage costs successfully across our global operations. Our profitability is also affected by the mix and volume of sales among our various product groups and between domestic and international customers and competitive pricing pressures.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States (U.S.). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates and their underlying assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other objective sources. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revises its estimates, as appropriate, when changes in events or circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary.\nThe following critical accounting policies and estimates reflected in our financial statements are based on management's knowledge of and experience with past and current events and on management's assumptions about future events. While we have generally not experienced significant deviations from our critical estimates in the past, it is reasonably possible that these estimates may ultimately differ materially from actual results. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of all of our significant accounting policies.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe use the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their fair values on the acquisition date. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are determined based upon management's valuation and involves making significant estimates and assumptions based on facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. We use a measurement period following the acquisition date to gather information that existed as of the acquisition date that is needed to determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The measurement period ends once all information is obtained, but no later than one year from the acquisition date.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue based on the satisfaction of distinct obligations to transfer goods and services to customers. The majority of our revenue is from product sales. Revenue from product sales is recognized when control is transferred to the customer, typically upon either shipment or delivery. A minor portion of our revenue is derived from project contracts containing a combination of product and service obligations. Revenue from project contracts is recognized either at a point in time or over time using cost input methods, based on the specific terms of each contract.\nFor project contracts containing multiple distinct performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated based on the relative standalone estimated selling price of each performance obligation. The relative standalone selling price is determined using current price lists and observable pricing in separate contracts with similar customers. For performance obligations recognized over-time, judgment is required to evaluate assumptions, including the total estimated costs to determine progress towards completion of the performance obligation and to calculate the corresponding amount of revenue to recognize. If estimated total costs on any contract are greater than the net contract revenues, the entire estimated loss is recognized in the period the loss becomes known. The cumulative effects on revenue from revisions to total estimated costs are recorded in the period in which the revisions to estimates are identified and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.\nWe also recognize revenue from other customer contract types, including licensing of intellectual property, software licensing and post-contract support (PCS) which may be sold as part of a bundled product offering or as a separate contract. For bundled product arrangements, the transaction price is allocated based on the relative standalone estimated selling price of each performance obligation. Distinct intellectual property obligations, including software, are considered functional in nature and are recognized as revenue at the point in time the customer receives the rights to use and benefit from the intellectual property or are determined using a usage-based royalty. PCS obligations are typically recognized over the term of the contract.\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled, based on customer contracts. For sales to distributors, system integrators and value-added resellers (primarily for CCS segment), revenue is adjusted for variable consideration amounts, including estimated discounts, returns, rebates and distributor price protection programs. These estimates are determined based upon historical experience, contract terms, inventory levels in the distributor channel and other related factors. Adjustments to variable consideration estimates are recorded when circumstances indicate revisions may be necessary.\nWe record a contract asset for unbilled accounts receivable related to revenue that has been recognized in advance of consideration being unconditionally due from the customer, which is common for certain project contract performance obligations. Contract asset amounts are transferred to accounts receivable when our right to the consideration becomes unconditional, which varies by contract, but is generally based on achieving certain acceptance milestones.\nA contract liability for deferred revenue is recorded when consideration is received or is unconditionally due from a customer prior to transferring control of goods or services to the customer under the terms of a contract. Deferred revenue balances typically result from advance payments received from customers for product contracts or from billings in excess of revenue recognized on project or services arrangements.\nWe include shipping and handling costs billed to customers in net sales and include the costs incurred to transport product to customers as cost of sales. Shipping and handling costs incurred after control is transferred to the customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are not accounted for as separate revenue obligations.\nInventory Reserves\nWe maintain reserves to reduce the value of inventory based on the lower of cost or net realizable value, including allowances for excess and obsolete inventory. These reserves are based on management's assumptions about and analysis of relevant factors including current levels of orders and backlog, forecasted demand, market conditions and new products or innovations that diminish the value of existing inventories. If actual market conditions deteriorate from those anticipated by management, additional allowances for excess and obsolete inventory could be required and may be material to earnings.\nProduct Warranty Reserves\nWe recognize a liability for the estimated claims that may be paid under our customer assurance-type warranty agreements to remedy potential deficiencies of quality or performance of our products. The product warranties extend over periods ranging from one to twenty-five years from the date of sale, depending upon the product subject to the warranty. We record a provision for estimated future warranty claims based upon the historical relationship of warranty claims to sales and specifically identified warranty issues. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revise our estimates, as appropriate, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary. Although these estimates are based on management's knowledge of and experience with past and current events and on management's assumptions about future events, it is reasonably possible that they may ultimately differ materially from actual results, including in the case of a significant product failure.\nTax Valuation Allowances and Liabilities for Unrecognized Tax Benefits\nWe establish an income tax valuation allowance when available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider the amounts, character, source and timing of expected future deductions or carryforwards as well as sources of taxable income and tax planning strategies that may enable utilization. We maintain an existing valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal. Changes in the amount or timing of expected future deductions or taxable income may have a material impact on the level of income tax valuation allowances. If we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of a deferred tax asset in the future, an increase to an income tax valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made.\nWe recognize income tax benefits related to particular tax positions only when it is considered more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained if examined on its technical merits by tax authorities. The amount of benefit recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is evaluated to be greater than 50% likely to be realized. Considerable judgment is required to evaluate the technical merits of various positions and to evaluate the likely amount of benefit to be realized. Lapses in statutes of limitations, developments in tax laws, regulations and interpretations, and changes in assessments of the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions could have a material impact on the overall tax provision.\nWe establish deferred tax liabilities for the estimated tax cost associated with foreign earnings that we do not consider permanently reinvested (primarily foreign withholding and state income taxes). These liabilities are subject to adjustment if there is a change in the assertion of whether the foreign earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested.\nWe also establish allowances related to value-added and similar recoverable taxes when it is considered probable that those assets are not recoverable. Changes in the probability of recovery or in the estimates of the amount recoverable are recognized in the period such determination is made and may be material to earnings.\nAsset Impairment Reviews\nImpairment Reviews of Goodwill\nWe test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment annually as of October 1 and on an interim basis when events occur or circumstances indicate the carrying value may no longer be recoverable. The goodwill impairment test starts with a comparison of the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value. We estimate the fair value of a reporting unit through the use of a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation model. The significant assumptions in the DCF model are the annual revenue growth rate, the annual operating income margin and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flow projections. Among other inputs, the annual revenue growth rate and operating income margin are determined by management using historical performance trends, industry data, insight derived from customers, relevant changes in the reporting unit's underlying business and other market trends that may affect the reporting unit. The discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital as of the test date of market participants in the industry in which the reporting unit operates. The assumptions used in the DCF model are subject to significant judgment and uncertainty. Changes in projected revenue growth rates, projected operating income margins or estimated discount rates due to uncertain market conditions, loss of one or more key customers, changes in technology, or other factors, could result in one or more of our reporting units with a significant amount of goodwill failing the goodwill impairment test in the future. It is possible that future impairment reviews may indicate additional impairments of goodwill, which could be material to our results of operations and financial position. Our historical or projected revenues or cash flows may not be indicative of actual future results.\n2018 Annual Goodwill Analysis\nThe annual test of goodwill was performed for each of the reporting units with goodwill balances as of October 1, 2018. The weighted average discount rates used in the 2018 annual test were 9.5% for the CCS reporting units and 10.0% for the CMS reporting units. These discount rates were unchanged from those used in the 2017 annual goodwill impairment tests. Based on the estimated fair values generated by our DCF models, the reporting units passed the annual goodwill impairment test. The Company considered the sensitivity to changes in key assumptions for the reporting unit with the lowest level of headroom and determined that a fifty basis point change in the discount rate or long-term growth rate would result in a potential impairment. Accordingly, if performance is worse than anticipated, future impairment tests could result in impairment charges that could be material to our results of operations.\nDefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nManagement reviews definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable. This analysis differs from our goodwill impairment analysis in that an intangible or other long-lived asset impairment is only deemed to have occurred if the sum of the forecasted undiscounted future net cash flows related to the assets being evaluated is less than the carrying value of the assets. If the forecasted net cash flows are less than the carrying value, then the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. During 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of $15.0 million allocated equally to the CCS and CMS segments related to our equity investment in a privately-held company. Other than this equity investment impairment and other certain assets abandoned or disposed of as part of restructuring actions, we did not identify any other impairments of definite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived assets in 2018. Changes in the estimates of forecasted net cash flows may result in future asset impairments that could be material to our results of operations.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nComparison of results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 with the year ended December 31, 2017\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Net\nSales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Net\nSales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,568.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,560.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,688.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,767.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (79.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 450.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 472.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP adjusted operating income (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 838.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 876.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (38.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 140.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 193.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (53.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (27.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted earnings per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.26\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (26.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\" in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,568.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,560.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Domestic net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,539.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,449.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 89.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,029.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,111.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (81.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales. Net sales for 2018 were essentially flat compared to 2017. Net sales in the U.S. and the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region increased in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase in the U.S. was driven by higher sales volumes primarily as a result of government initiatives to promote the expansion of wireless networks but was partially offset by reductions in certain selling prices. Net sales in the U.S. also benefitted from incremental net sales in 2018 related to the acquisition of Cable Exchange on August 1, 2017. The increase in net sales in the EMEA region for 2018 was driven mostly by favorable foreign exchange rate changes. These increases in net sales were largely offset by decreases in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region as a result of projects in 2017 that did not recur in 2018. Net sales in the Caribbean and Latin America (CALA) region also decreased in 2018 with higher sales volumes being more than offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes. Net sales to customers located outside of the U.S. comprised 44% for 2018 compared to 46% for 2017.\nFrom a segment perspective, net sales from the CCS segment and the CMS segment in 2018 were both relatively unchanged compared to 2017. CCS segment net sales in the EMEA region and in the U.S. both increased but these were mostly offset by decreases in the APAC region. Net sales from the CMS segment increased in the U.S. but that increase was mostly offset by decreases in the APAC region. For further details by segment, see the section titled Segment Results\u201d below.\nGross profit, SG&A expense and R&D expense\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,688.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,767.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (79.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As a percent of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SG&A expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 729.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 795.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (66.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As a percent of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> R&D expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 185.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 185.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As a percent of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross profit (net sales less cost of sales). Despite higher sales volumes and favorable product and geographic mix, gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased for 2018, primarily due to reductions in certain selling prices, higher material costs and unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense for 2018 was lower than 2017 due primarily to benefits from cost reduction initiatives and lower costs related to the integration of the Broadband Network Solutions (BNS) business acquired from TE Connectivity in 2015. These decreases in costs were partially offset by higher transaction costs related to the pending acquisition of ARRIS, higher incentive compensation expense and higher bad debt expense in 2018. SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased from the prior year as a result of these overall net reductions in expense.\nResearch and development. Research and development (R&D) expense and R&D expense as a percentage of sales were virtually unchanged for 2018 compared to the prior year. R&D activities generally relate to ensuring that our products are capable of meeting the evolving technological needs of our customers, bringing new products to market and modifying existing products to better serve our customers.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets, Restructuring costs and Asset impairments\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of purchased intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 264.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 271.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (6.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring costs, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset impairments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNM - Not meaningful\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets. The amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased for 2018 compared to the prior year because certain of our intangible assets became fully amortized. This decrease was partially offset during 2018 by the amortization of intangible assets related to the Cable Exchange acquisition that occurred in August 2017.\nRestructuring costs, net. Restructuring costs, net for 2018 were related to the continuing integration of the BNS business and a voluntary retirement program in the U.S. that was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2018. Restructuring costs, net for 2017 were primarily related to the continuing integration of the BNS business. No significant additional restructuring charges are expected to be incurred to complete the previously announced BNS integration initiatives. From a cash perspective, we paid $42.1 million to settle restructuring liabilities during 2018. We expect to pay $29.9 million in 2019 and $5.2 million between 2020 and 2022 related to restructuring actions that have been initiated. Additional restructuring actions may be identified and the resulting charges and cash requirements may be material.\nAsset impairments. During 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of $15.0 million allocated equally to the CCS and CMS segments to fully impair an equity investment in a privately-held company. We did not record any asset impairment charges during 2017.\nNet interest expense, Other expense, net and Income taxes\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (235.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (252.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (44.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (34.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 366.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (30.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 90.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet interest expense. Net interest expense for 2018 decreased due to lower long-term debt balances as a result of the voluntary repayments in the fourth quarter of 2017 and in July 2018 on the senior secured term loan due 2022 (the 2022 Term Loan) as well as the May 2017 amendment to reduce the interest rate margin on the 2022 Term Loan. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in LIBOR. In connection with the repayment of the 2022 Term Loan in July 2018, we wrote off $7.4 million of debt issuance costs and original issue discount. Similarly, in 2017, we wrote off $14.1 million of debt issuance costs and original issue discount in connection with the redemption of $500.0 million of 4.375% senior secured notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes) and the repayment of $460.0 million of senior secured term loans. The redemption of the 2020 Notes and the repayment of the senior secured term loans were substantially funded by the issuance in March 2017 of $750.0 million of 5.00% senior notes due 2027 (the 2027 Notes).\nOur weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings, including the amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount, was 5.73% at December 31, 2018 and 5.45% at December 31, 2017.\nOther expense, net. In 2018, we terminated a significant U.S. defined benefit pension plan which was settled through the purchase of annuities. As a result of the settlement, we recognized a pretax charge in other expense, net primarily related to unrecognized net actuarial losses previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $34.5 million. We also amended certain of our U.S. postretirement medical plans to terminate benefits as of December 31, 2018. We recognized a pretax gain in other expense, net in 2018 of $9.7 million related to unrecognized prior service credits and unrecognized net actuarial gains previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nNet periodic benefit income of $9.1 million, excluding the amounts discussed above, was included in other expense, net for 2018 as a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. Other expense, net for 2017 was recast to include $5.6 million of net periodic benefit income as a result of the new guidance. See the discussion under Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding the adoption of this new accounting guidance.\nForeign exchange losses of $29.9 million were included in other expense, net for 2018 compared to foreign exchange losses of $8.7 million for 2017. The 2018 amount included a $14.0 million pretax loss related to foreign currency translation adjustments previously reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss that were recognized in other expense, net due to the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary.\nThe change in other expense, net for 2018 compared to the prior year was also impacted by a redemption premium of $14.8 million incurred during the first quarter of 2017 in connection with the redemption of the 2020 Notes, partially offset by $9.0 million in gains recognized during 2017 related to the sale of our investment in Hydrogenics Corporation.\nIncome tax expense. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted tax reform legislation (U.S. tax reform) that reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and included a broad range of complex provisions affecting the taxation of businesses. Generally, financial statement recognition of the new legislation would be required to be completed in the period of enactment; however, in response to the complexities of this new legislation, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 to provide companies with transitional relief. Specifically, while the initial accounting for items under the new legislation was incomplete, the guidance allowed the recognition of provisional amounts when reasonable estimates could be made or the continued application of the prior tax law if a reasonable estimate of the effect could not be made. The SEC staff provided up to one year for companies to finalize the accounting for the effects of this new legislation. During 2018, we recognized $7.8 million of tax benefit related to changes made to the provisional amounts, primarily related to our transition tax and from revaluing our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nThe effective income tax rate of 17.9% for 2018 was lower than the statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to a reduction in tax expense of $23.3 million related to the expiration of statutes of limitations on various uncertain tax positions, the $7.8 million benefit recorded for changes to the provisional amounts as indicated above and the favorable impact of $4.6 million of excess tax benefits related to equity-based compensation awards for 2018. These decreases to the effective tax rate were partially offset by an increase in tax expense due to the effect of the provision for state income taxes, the impact of earnings in foreign jurisdictions that are taxed at rates higher than the U.S., the impact of the new U.S. anti-deferral provisions and the impact of repatriation taxes.\nOur effective income tax rate of 7.6% for 2017 reflected the impact of U.S. tax reform enacted in December 2017. Our effective income tax rate was also favorably affected by changes in tax legislation in certain other jurisdictions and a reduction in tax expense related to the expiration of statutes of limitations on various uncertain tax positions. In addition, the effective tax rate was favorably affected by $14.4 million of excess tax benefits related to equity-based compensation awards for 2017.\nSegment Results\nTable 115: <table> <tr>

Net sales increased in the EMEA region primarily due to favorable foreign exchange rate changes for 2018. Net sales also increased in the U.S. for 2018, driven by incremental net sales due to the acquisition of Cable Exchange on August 1, 2017. These increases were mostly offset by reductions in certain selling prices in the U.S. as well as decreases in net sales in the APAC region and in Canada. Despite higher sales volumes, net sales in the CALA region were unchanged in 2018 due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes.\nCCS segment operating income increased during 2018 compared to the prior year while non-GAAP adjusted operating income decreased slightly. CCS segment operating income benefitted from lower integration costs and restructuring costs offset by the impairment of our equity investment in a privately-owned entity in 2018, all of which are excluded from non-GAAP adjusted operating income. Both operating income and non-GAAP adjusted operating income benefitted from higher sales volumes, favorable product and geographic mix and cost savings initiatives that were partially offset by selling price reductions, higher material costs and unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes impacting costs. See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\u201d within this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below.\nWe expect demand for our indoor network CCS products to be driven by global information technology spending, particularly for hyperscale and cloud data center networks, as the ongoing need for bandwidth and intelligence in the network continues to create demand for high-performance connectivity solutions. We expect demand for our outdoor network CCS products to be driven by global deployment of fiber-optic solutions for fiber-to-the-X applications, new services, densification, competitive dynamics in the access market, ongoing maintenance requirements of cable networks and residential construction market activity in North America. Spending patterns by service providers and data center customers can be volatile. Uncertain global economic conditions, variability in the levels of commercial and residential construction activity, consolidation among service providers, uncertain levels of information technology spending and reductions in the levels of distributor inventories may negatively affect demand for our products. The increasing demand for fiber solutions is expected to be somewhat offset by decelerating demand for copper solutions in networks. We expect modest near-term net sales growth in the CCS segment as a result of these business dynamics as well as ongoing pricing pressure.\nCommScope Mobility Solutions Segment\nCMS segment net sales were relatively unchanged during 2018 compared to 2017. The CMS segment saw higher sales volumes in the U.S. primarily as a result of government initiatives to promote the expansion of wireless networks. The increase in U.S. sales volumes was offset partially by reductions in certain selling prices. The increase in CMS segment net sales in the U.S. was largely offset by decreases in the APAC region. Foreign exchange rate changes were not significant to CMS segment net sales for 2018.\nCMS segment operating income and non-GAAP adjusted operating income decreased in 2018 primarily due to selling price reductions and unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes impacting costs, partially offset by favorable product and geographic mix and higher sales volumes. CMS segment operating income was also impacted by higher restructuring costs and the impairment of our equity investment in a privately-owned entity in 2018, which are both excluded from non-GAAP adjusted operating income. See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\u201d within this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below.\nOur sales to wireless operators are volatile. We expect longer-term demand for our CMS products to be positively affected by wireless coverage and capacity expansion in emerging markets and growth in mobile data services and network capacity requirements in developed markets. In addition, we expect demand for our CMS products to continue to be favorably affected by government initiatives to promote the expansion of wireless networks (e.g., FirstNet), new spectrum deployments (e.g., Citizen's Broadband Radio Service or CBRS) and a venue refresh cycle over the next couple of years. We also expect longer-term demand for our CMS products to be positively affected by the introduction of 5G technology. In preparation for 5G networks, we continue to invest heavily in R&D, support customer trials and participate in industry forums to help shape 5G standards. Uncertainty in the global economy or a particular region or consolidation among or other investments by wireless operators may slow the growth or cause a decline in capital spending by wireless operators and negatively impact our net sales. We expect modest near-term net sales growth in the CMS segment as a result of these business dynamics as well as ongoing pricing pressure.\nComparison of results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 with the year ended December 31, 2016\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Net\nSales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Net\nSales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,560.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,923.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (363.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,767.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,029.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (261.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 472.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 567.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (95.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP adjusted operating income (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 876.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,044.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (167.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 193.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 222.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (29.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted earnings per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.15\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\" within this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,560.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,923.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (363.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Domestic net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,449.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,634.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (185.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,111.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,288.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (177.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales.

The decrease in gross profit for 2017 compared to 2016 was mainly driven by decreases in sales volume, reductions in price, unfavorable geographic and product mix and higher material costs. This decrease was partially offset by the favorable impact of cost reduction initiatives.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. SG&A expense for 2017 was lower than 2016 due primarily to lower incentive compensation expense and benefits from cost reduction initiatives. Despite lower net sales, SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased from 2016 as a result of these lower costs.\nResearch and development. R&D expense decreased for 2017 compared to 2016 primarily as a result of lower incentive compensation expense. R&D expense as a percentage of sales remained unchanged from 2016.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets, Restructuring costs and Asset impairments\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of purchased intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 271.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 297.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (26.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring costs, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset impairments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (38.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets. The amortization of purchased intangible assets was lower for 2017 compared to 2016 primarily because certain of our intangible assets became fully amortized. This was partially offset by the amortization of intangible assets related to the Cable Exchange acquisition.\nRestructuring costs, net. The restructuring costs for 2017 and 2016 were primarily related to the continuing integration of the BNS acquisition.\nAsset impairments. We did not record any asset impairment charges during 2017. During 2016, we recorded impairment charges of $15.0 million within the CCS segment due to the revised business plan for a product line that indicated its intangible assets would not be recoverable. Also during 2016, we recorded impairment charges of $8.3 million related to certain long-lived assets acquired with the BNS business that were no longer expected to be utilized in operations within the CCS segment. In addition to these intangible asset and long-lived asset impairment charges, 2016 included a $15.3 million goodwill impairment charge in the CCS segment as a result of the impairment analysis required by the change in reportable segments.\nNet interest expense, Other expense, net and Income taxes\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (252.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (272.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (23.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (58.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (67.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet interest expense. The decrease in net interest expense for 2017 as compared to 2016 resulted primarily from decreases in our long-term debt due to our debt redemptions and repayments in 2017 and 2016. Our average long-term debt outstanding decreased by more than $400.0 million for 2017 as compared to 2016. During 2017, the reduction in interest expense was offset partially by the write-off of $14.1 million of debt issuance costs and original issue discount in connection with the redemption of $500.0 million of the 2020 Notes and the prepayment of $460.0 million of senior secured term loans. The redemption of the 2020 Notes and the prepayment of the senior secured term loans were substantially funded by the issuance of the 2027 Notes in March 2017.\nDuring 2016, we repaid $150.0 million of our senior secured term loan due in 2018 and voluntarily redeemed $536.6 million of the 6.625%/7.375% senior payment-in-kind toggle notes (the senior PIK toggle notes). In connection with the repayment and redemption, we wrote off $7.1 million of debt issuance costs and original issue discount to interest expense during 2016.\nOur weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings, including the amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount, was 5.45% at December 31, 2017 and 5.24% at December 31, 2016.\nOther expense, net. In connection with the redemption of the 2020 Notes during 2017, we paid a redemption premium of $14.8 million which was included in other expense, net. In May 2017, we amended the 2022 Term Loan to reduce the interest rate margin, and in connection with the amendment, we incurred debt modification costs of $1.1 million which were included in other expense, net for 2017. In connection with the debt redeemed or repaid during 2016, we incurred redemption premiums of $17.7 million and other fees of $1.2 million which were included in other expense, net.\nForeign exchange losses of $8.7 million were included in other expense, net for 2017 compared to losses of $9.5 million for 2016.\nDuring 2017, we sold the remainder of our investment in Hydrogenics resulting in pretax gains of $9.0 million which were recorded in other expense, net. During 2016, sales of Hydrogenics shares resulted in pretax gains of $1.2 million.\nIncome tax expense. Our effective income tax rate of 7.6% for 2017 reflected the impact of U.S. tax reform enacted in December 2017. Our effective income tax rate was also favorably affected by changes in tax legislation in certain other jurisdictions and a reduction in tax expense related to the expiration of statutes of limitations on various uncertain tax positions. The effective tax rate was also favorably affected by $14.4 million of excess tax benefits related to equity-based compensation awards for 2017.\nOur effective income tax rate of 18.2% for 2016 was lower than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to a reduction in tax expense related to the release of valuation allowances related to certain federal tax credit carryforwards and certain other deferred tax assets. The effective income tax rate was also favorably affected by the reduction of reserves for uncertain tax positions and earnings in foreign jurisdictions that we did not plan to repatriate. These foreign earnings were generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S. Offsetting these decreases in 2016 was the effect of the provision for state income taxes as well as the goodwill impairment charge for which only partial tax benefits were recorded.\nSegment Results\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

</tr>\n</table>\nCommScope Connectivity Solutions Segment\nCCS segment net sales were lower in 2017 compared to 2016 in all regions except the EMEA region. The decrease was driven by the U.S. and the APAC region as a result of a slowdown in the rollout of new projects by certain North American service providers, continued weakness in demand for our indoor network products, and certain large projects in the APAC region in 2016 that did not recur in 2017. In addition, we experienced BNS integration issues early in 2017 that negatively affected customer service levels and order rates. Incremental sales related to the Cable Exchange acquisition completed in August 2017 were not material to the CCS segment for 2017. Foreign exchange rate changes did not significantly impact segment sales for 2017 compared to 2016.\nCCS segment operating income and non-GAAP adjusted operating income decreased for 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to lower sales volumes, price reductions, unfavorable geographic and product mix and higher material costs. These decreases were partially offset by the favorable impact of cost reduction initiatives and lower incentive compensation. The decrease in CCS segment operating income was also partially offset by lower intangible asset amortization, lower impairment charges and lower integration and transaction costs during 2017 compared to 2016. The impacts of intangible asset amortization, impairment charges and integration and transaction costs are excluded from the calculation of non-GAAP adjusted operating income.\nCommScope Mobility Solutions Segment\nThe CMS segment experienced a decrease in net sales for 2017 compared to 2016 in all major regions, with the decrease being most pronounced in the U.S. and the APAC region. While CMS segment net sales benefited from increased spending by certain domestic operators in the first quarter of 2017, we saw a slowdown in their spending during the remainder of 2017. The decline in sales of our CMS products in the APAC region was primarily due to certain large projects in 2016 that did not recur during 2017. Foreign exchange rate changes did not significantly impact segment sales for 2017 compared to 2016.\nCMS segment operating income and non-GAAP adjusted operating income decreased for 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to lower sales volumes, price reductions and unfavorable geographic mix, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. The decrease in CMS segment operating income for 2017 compared to 2016 was partially offset by lower intangible amortization and restructuring costs.

To fund the Pending Acquisition, on February 19, 2019 we issued $1.25 billion of 5.50% senior secured notes due 2024, $1.5 billion of 6.00% senior secured notes due 2026 and $1.0 billion of 8.25% senior unsecured notes due 2027 and priced the borrowing of $3.2 billion under a new senior secured term loan due 2026 with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.25%. The proceeds of the notes were placed into escrow and will be released upon consummation of the Pending Acquisition, and it is expected that the new senior secured term loan will be borrowed at closing of the Pending Acquisition. We expect to use a portion of the new senior secured term loan to pay off our existing senior secured term loan due December 2022. We also expect to enter into a new asset-based revolving credit facility in an amount of up to $1.0 billion, subject to borrowing base capacity. In addition to the new debt, we expect to fund the Pending Acquisition by issuing 1.0 million shares of series A convertible preferred stock to the Carlyle Group for $1,000 per share, or an aggregate investment of $1.0 billion. On a long-term basis, our potential sources of liquidity include raising capital through additional issuances of debt and/or equity.\nIn addition to funding the pending ARRIS acquisition, the primary uses of liquidity include debt service requirements, funding working capital requirements, capital expenditures, paying restructuring and integration costs, income tax payments and funding pension benefits. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and cash flows from operations, combined with the long-term borrowings incurred for the pending ARRIS acquisition, availability under our current and future revolving credit facility and access to capital markets, will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated future cash needs. We may experience volatility in cash flows between periods due to, among other reasons, variability in the timing of vendor payments and customer receipts. We may, from time to time, borrow under our revolving credit facility or issue securities, if market conditions are favorable, to meet future cash needs or to reduce our borrowing costs.\nAlthough there are no financial maintenance covenants under the terms of our senior notes, there is a limitation, among other limitations, on certain future borrowings based on an adjusted leverage ratio or a fixed charge coverage ratio. These ratios are based on financial measures similar to adjusted EBITDA as presented in the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\u201d section below, but also give pro forma effect to certain events, including acquisitions and savings from cost reduction initiatives such as facility closures and headcount reductions. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our pro forma adjusted EBITDA, as measured pursuant to the indentures governing our notes, was $951.5 million, which included $37.9 million of savings from announced cost reduction initiatives so that the impact of the cost reduction initiatives is fully reflected in the twelve-month period used in the calculation of the ratios. In addition to limitations under these indentures, our senior secured credit facilities contain customary negative covenants. We believe we are in compliance with the covenants under our indentures and senior secured credit facilities at December 31, 2018.\nCash and cash equivalents increased slightly during 2018. We generated less cash from operations and had higher capital expenditures in 2018 compared to 2017. However, in 2017 we used cash on hand to fund our purchase of Cable Exchange for $105.2 million. In 2018, we made net voluntary repayments of $400.0 million on the 2022 Term Loan while in 2017 we made $210.0 million in voluntary repayments of debt and repurchased $175.0 million of our common stock. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 70% of our cash and cash equivalents were held outside the U.S.\nWorking capital, excluding cash and cash equivalents, decreased during 2018. The decrease was mainly due to lower accounts receivable balances due to the timing of net sales. This decrease was partially offset by lower accounts payable balances and higher inventory balances as of December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. The net reduction in total capitalization during 2018 reflected the repayment of $400.0 million on the 2022 Term Loan and foreign currency translation losses partially offset by current year earnings.\nCash Flow Overview\nComparison for the year ended December 31, 2018 with the year ended December 31, 2017\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash generated by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 494.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 586.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (92.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (64.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (166.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 101.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (409.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (413.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNM - Not meaningful\nOperating Activities\nDuring 2018, we generated $494.1 million of cash through operating activities compared to $586.3 million during 2017. The lower level of cash generation was primarily due to lower earnings, increases in cash used to build inventory and higher cash payments for interest and taxes. The decreases were offset partially by lower payments of incentive compensation compared with the prior year.\nInvesting Activities\nInvestment in property, plant and equipment during 2018 was $82.3 million compared with $68.7 million for the prior year. The investment in property, plant and equipment was primarily related to supporting improvements in manufacturing operations, including expanding production capacity and investing in information technology, including software developed for internal use.\nDuring 2018 and 2017, we sold property and equipment no longer being utilized for $12.9 million and $5.4 million, respectively.\nDuring 2018 and 2017, we received $5.1 million and paid $7.6 million, respectively, to settle net investment hedges that we entered into for the purpose of mitigating a portion of the foreign currency risk on the euro net investment in a foreign subsidiary.\nDuring 2017, we acquired Cable Exchange and paid $105.2 million, net of cash acquired, using cash on hand. Also during 2017, we received proceeds of $9.9 million related to the sale of the remainder of our investment in Hydrogenics.\nFinancing Activities\nIn July 2018, we repaid $400.0 million of the 2022 Term Loan. The payment was made using $250.0 million of cash on hand and $150.0 million borrowed under our asset-based revolving credit facility (the revolving credit facility) which was repaid during the third quarter of 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the remaining availability was $463.1 million, reflecting a borrowing base of $492.6 million reduced by $29.5 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility. During 2018, we received proceeds of $6.1 million related to the exercise of stock options. Also during 2018, employees surrendered 407,938 shares of our common stock to satisfy their tax withholding requirements on vested restricted stock units and performance share units, which reduced cash flows by $15.7 million.\nDuring 2017, we issued the 2027 Notes for $750.0 million and the proceeds, together with cash on hand, were used to (i) redeem all $500.0 million of the outstanding 2020 Notes, (ii) repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our senior secured term loans, including $111.9 million of outstanding principal on our senior secured term loan due 2018 and $138.1 million of outstanding principal on the 2022 Term Loan, and (iii) pay related fees and expenses. We paid a $14.8 million premium to redeem the 2020 Notes and paid $7.2 million in debt issuance costs related to the 2027 Notes. In addition, during 2017, we amended the 2022 Term Loan to reduce the interest rate margin by 50 basis points which resulted in the repayment of $30.4 million to certain lenders under the senior secured credit facilities and the receipt of $30.4 million in proceeds from the new lenders and existing lenders who increased their positions. We also paid $1.1 million in debt modification costs related to this amendment. Also during 2017, we voluntarily repaid $210.0 million of the 2022 Term Loan. During 2017, we paid cash of $175.0 million to repurchase stock under stock repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors in 2017. The repurchase authorization expired on July 31, 2018. In addition, we received proceeds of $9.9 million related to the exercise of stock options and employees surrendered 411,932 shares of our common stock to satisfy their tax withholding requirements on vested restricted stock units, which reduced cash flows by $15.4 million.\nComparison for the year ended December 31, 2017 with the year ended December 31, 2016\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash generated by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 586.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 640.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (53.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (166.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (54.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (111.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (413.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (708.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 294.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNM - Not meaningful\nOperating Activities\nDuring 2017, we generated $586.3 million of cash through operating activities compared to $640.2 million during 2016. The lower level of cash generation was primarily due to the prior year benefit generated from the extension of vendor payment terms as well as higher 2016 incentive compensation which was paid in 2017 and lower operating performance in 2017 compared to 2016. These declines were partially offset by higher cash flow from accounts receivable due to changes in the timing of sales and collections as well as approximately $59.2 million of customer payments received in late 2017 that were not due until 2018. In addition, we paid lower cash taxes and cash interest during 2017 than in 2016.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring 2017, we acquired Cable Exchange and paid $105.2 million, net of cash acquired, using cash on hand. We recorded a noncurrent liability for the remaining $14.5 million of payments due to the sellers. During 2016, we received adjustments to the BNS acquisition purchase price of $7.1 million and paid $1.0 million as a final payment on a previous acquisition.\nInvestment in property, plant and equipment during 2017 was $68.7 million compared with $68.3 million for the prior year. The investment in property, plant and equipment was primarily related to supporting improvements in manufacturing operations, including expanding production capacity and investing in information technology, including software developed for internal use.\nDuring 2017, we received proceeds of $9.9 million related to the sale of the remainder of our investment in Hydrogenics. During 2016, we received $1.3 million in proceeds related to the sale of a portion of that investment.\nDuring 2017, we paid $7.6 million to settle a net investment hedge that we entered into in 2017 for the purpose of mitigating a portion of the foreign currency risk on the euro net investment in a foreign subsidiary. As of December 31, 2017, we had entered into another net investment hedge intended to mitigate the same risk with an outstanding maturity of twelve months.\nDuring 2017 and 2016, we sold properties no longer being utilized for $4.5 million and $3.7 million, respectively.\nFinancing Activities\nIn March 2017, we issued the 2027 Notes for $750.0 million and the proceeds, together with cash on hand, were used to (i) redeem all $500.0 million of the outstanding 2020 Notes, (ii) repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our senior secured term loans, including the $111.9 million of outstanding principal on our senior secured term loan due 2018 and $138.1 million of outstanding principal on the 2022 Term Loan, and (iii) pay related fees and expenses.

We also paid $1.1 million in debt modification costs related to this amendment. In addition, we voluntarily repaid $210.0 million of the 2022 Term Loan during 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the remaining availability was $425.4 million, reflecting a borrowing base of $452.4 million reduced by $27.0 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility.\nDuring the first half of 2017, we paid cash of $100.0 million to repurchase stock under the stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in February 2017. We had no remaining authorization under this stock repurchase program as of December 31, 2017. In August 2017, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase plan of up to $100.0 million. We paid cash of $75.0 million to repurchase stock under this plan during 2017. We had $25.0 million of remaining authorization under this stock repurchase program as of December 31, 2017. The repurchase authorization under this plan expired on July 31, 2018.\nDuring 2017, we received proceeds of $9.9 million related to the exercise of stock options. Also during 2017, employees surrendered 411,932 shares of our common stock to satisfy their tax withholding requirements on vested restricted stock units and performance share units, which reduced cash flows by $15.4 million.\nDuring 2016, we voluntarily redeemed the remaining $536.6 million of our senior PIK toggle notes and made mandatory debt repayments of $12.5 million on the 2022 Term Loan. In connection with the debt redeemed or repaid in 2016, we paid redemption premiums of $17.7 million and other fees of $1.2 million. Also during 2016, we received proceeds of $16.8 million related to the exercise of stock options and employees surrendered 143,000 shares of our common stock to satisfy their tax withholding requirements on vested restricted stock units, which reduced cash flows by $3.9 million.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\nWe believe that presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures enhances an investor's understanding of our financial performance. We further believe that these financial measures are useful in assessing our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business. We also use certain of these financial measures for business planning purposes and in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors. We believe these financial measures are commonly used by investors to evaluate our performance and the performance of our competitors. However, our use of the terms non-GAAP adjusted operating income and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA may vary from that of others in our industry. These financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to operating income (loss), net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP as measures of operating performance, operating cash flows or liquidity.\nConsolidated\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td>

The impact on our disclosures was to remove the disclosure of the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss expected to be recognized as net periodic benefit cost in the next year and to provide explanations of significant gains and losses related to the changes in the benefit obligation for the period. The impacts were applied retrospectively to the disclosures for all periods presented. The adoption of this ASU only affected the disclosures on our defined benefit pension plans and did not affect our consolidated financial statements. See Note 10 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10- K for further discussion of our defined benefit pension plans.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we early adopted ASU No. 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which allows companies to elect reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for certain tax effects resulting from the U.S. tax legislation enacted in 2017. Our policy is to generally recognize the tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income at the currently enacted tax rate and reclassify it to net income in the same period that the related pre-tax accumulated comprehensive income reclassifications are recognized. We did not elect the permitted reclassification and therefore adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, including all subsequently issued clarifying guidance, on January 1, 2018. The core principle of the new guidance is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. We adopted the standard using the modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of applying the standard on the date of adoption recognized in retained earnings (accumulated deficit).\nRevenue recognition for our product sales remained generally consistent with historical practice. However, the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 resulted in acceleration of revenue recognition for certain project contracts containing integrated product and service obligations, primarily within the CMS segment. These multi-element contracts represented less than 2.0% of total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. For these contracts, certain performance obligations are recognized over time using cost-based input methods, which recognize revenue and cost of sales based on the relationship between actual costs incurred compared to the total estimated cost for the performance obligation. Based on contracts in effect at January 1, 2018, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment, net of tax, of $3.4 million, which reduced the accumulated deficit on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. This adjustment reflects an acceleration of $8.0 million of net sales.\nThe impact of adoption of the new revenue recognition standard on the consolidated financial statements was as follows:\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> As Reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amounts Without Adoption of\nASU No. 2014-09\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Effect of Change\nIncrease / (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,568,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,572,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,127\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,880,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,881,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,697\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 449,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 452,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,430\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (622\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 140,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 142,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,808\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table></table>\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> As Reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amounts Without Adoption of\nASU No. 2014-09\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Effect of Change\nIncrease / (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Assets:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accounts receivable, less allowance\nfor doubtful accounts\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 810,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 808,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Inventories, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 473,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 475,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,681\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Liabilities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other accrued liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 291,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 292,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,308\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stockholders' equity:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Retained earnings (accumulated deficit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (249,777\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (251,382\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe adopted ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, on January 1, 2018. This new guidance modifies how entities measure equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting) and present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities; simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment; changes presentation and disclosure requirements; and clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity's other deferred tax assets. Adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nWe adopted ASU No. 2016-16, Accounting for Income Taxes, Intra-Entity Asset Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory, on January 1, 2018. Under previous guidance, the tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers were deferred until the transferred asset was sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use. The new guidance eliminates the exception for all intra-entity sales of assets other than inventory. As a result, the tax effect of an intra-entity asset sale would be recognized when the transfer occurs. We recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $2.6 million as of January 1, 2018 that decreased the accumulated deficit on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a result of this new guidance.\nWe adopted ASU No. 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, on January 1, 2018. The new standard requires an employer to report the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the employee and requires the other components of net periodic benefit cost to be reported outside the subtotal of operating income. Of the total $19.8 million of net periodic benefit cost for year ended December 31, 2018, $15.7 million of net periodic benefit cost was recorded in other expense, net, and $4.1 million of net periodic benefit cost was recorded within operating income. We utilized the practical expedient and used the amounts disclosed in our employee benefit plans note for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 as the basis for applying the retrospective presentation requirements. We reclassified $5.6 million and $7.1 million of net periodic benefit income from operating income to other expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on the previously reported income before income taxes or net income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nWe adopted ASU No. 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, on January 1, 2018. The new guidance provides targeted improvements to the hedge accounting model intended to allow financial reporting to more closely reflect an entity's risk management activities and to simplify the application of hedge accounting. Beginning January 1, 2018, we elected to assess the effectiveness of our net investment hedges using the spot rate method. As a result, differences between the spot rate and the forward rate will be amortized to earnings on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract. See Note 7 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10- K for further details on our derivative and hedging activities and the related impacts to the financial statements.\nIssued but Not Adopted\nIn August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2018-15, Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement (CCA) that is a Service Contract, which aligns the accounting for costs incurred to implement a CCA that is a service arrangement with the guidance on capitalizing costs associated with developing or obtaining internal-use software. ASU No. 2018-15 is effective for us as of January 1, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact of the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements and when it will be adopted.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test of Goodwill Impairment, which eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under the new guidance, an entity will perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity will recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. ASU No. 2017-04 is effective for us as of January 1, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. We plan to adopt this new guidance as of January 1, 2019 and do not anticipate that adoption will materially affect the consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The new guidance replaces the current incurred loss method used for determining credit losses on financial assets, including trade receivables, with an expected credit loss method. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for us as of January 1, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact of the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which supersedes the current leasing guidance in Topic 840, Leases. Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize assets and lease liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leased assets previously classified as operating leases. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for us as of January 1, 2019. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, which allows entities a transition election to recognize the effects of applying the new leasing standard as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings (accumulated deficit) as opposed to restating comparative periods for the effects of applying the new standard. We expect to elect this transition approach. We are finalizing the necessary changes to our accounting policies, processes, internal controls and information systems that will be required to meet the new standard's reporting and disclosure requirements. The majority of our leased asset value relates to real estate with the remainder primarily related to vehicles and equipment. We estimate that adoption of the new standard will increase total assets and total liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets by $95 million to $100 million due to the addition of right-of-use assets and lease obligations for operating type leases, net of the elimination of existing prepaid rent, deferred rent and lease termination cost amounts. We do not expect the adoption of the new standard to significantly affect the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income or the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are not a party to any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, except for operating leases. There have not been any material changes to our off-balance sheet arrangements during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nEffects of Inflation and Changing Prices\nWe continually attempt to minimize the effect of inflation on earnings by controlling our operating costs and adjusting our selling prices. The principal raw materials purchased by us (copper, aluminum, steel, plastics and other polymers, bimetals and optical fiber) are subject to changes in market price as they are influenced by commodity markets and other factors. Prices for copper, fluoropolymers and certain other polymers derived from oil and natural gas have, at times, been volatile. As a result, we have adjusted our prices for certain products and may have to adjust prices again in the future. To the extent that we are unable to pass on cost increases to customers without a significant decrease in sales volume or must implement price reductions in response to a rapid decline in raw material costs, these cost changes could have a material adverse impact on the results of our operations.\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Also during 2016, we recorded impairment charges of $8.3 million related to certain long-lived assets acquired with the BNS business that were no longer expected to be utilized in operations within the CCS segment. In addition to these intangible asset and long-lived asset impairment charges, 2016 included a $15.3 million goodwill impairment charge in the CCS segment as a result of the impairment analysis required by the change in reportable segments.\nWe recognize a liability for the estimated claims that may be paid under our customer assurance-type warranty agreements to remedy potential deficiencies of quality or performance of our products. The product warranties extend over periods ranging from one to twenty-five years from the date of sale, depending upon the product subject to the warranty. We record a provision for estimated future warranty claims based upon the historical relationship of warranty claims to sales and specifically identified warranty issues. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revise our estimates, as appropriate, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary. Although these estimates are based on management's knowledge of and experience with past and current events and on management's assumptions about future events, it is reasonably possible that they may ultimately differ materially from actual results, including in the case of a significant product failure.\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Net\nSales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Net\nSales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,568.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,560.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,688.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,767.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (79.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 450.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 472.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP adjusted operating income (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 838.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 876.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (38.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 140.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 193.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (53.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (27.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted earnings per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.26\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (26.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross profit (net sales less cost of sales).

These increases were mostly offset by reductions in certain selling prices in the U.S. as well as decreases in net sales in the APAC region and in Canada.

However, the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 resulted in acceleration of revenue recognition for certain project contracts containing integrated product and service obligations, primarily within the CMS segment. These multi-element contracts represented less than 2.0% of total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. For these contracts, certain performance obligations are recognized over time using cost-based input methods, which recognize revenue and cost of sales based on the relationship between actual costs incurred compared to the total estimated cost for the performance obligation. Based on contracts in effect at January 1, 2018, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment, net of tax, of $3.4 million, which reduced the accumulated deficit on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. This adjustment reflects an acceleration of $8.0 million of net sales.\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,560.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,923.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (363.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Domestic net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,449.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,634.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (185.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,111.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,288.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (177.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNM - Not meaningful\nDuring 2017 and 2016, we sold properties no longer being utilized for $4.5 million and $3.7 million, respectively.\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash generated by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 494.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 586.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (92.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (64.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (166.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 101.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (409.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (413.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (252.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (272.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (23.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (58.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (67.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States (U.S.). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates and their underlying assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other objective sources. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revises its estimates, as appropriate, when changes in events or circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary.\n\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 458.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 454.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Working capital (1), excluding cash and cash\nequivalents and current portion of long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 729.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 766.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (37.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Availability under revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 463.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 425.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt, including current portion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,985.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,369.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (383.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total capitalization (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,742.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,017.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (274.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt, including current portion, as a\npercentage of total capitalization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlthough there are no financial maintenance covenants under the terms of our senior notes, there is a limitation, among other limitations, on certain future borrowings based on an adjusted leverage ratio or a fixed charge coverage ratio. These ratios are based on financial measures similar to adjusted EBITDA as presented in the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\u201d section below, but also give pro forma effect to certain events, including acquisitions and savings from cost reduction initiatives such as facility closures and headcount reductions. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our pro forma adjusted EBITDA, as measured pursuant to the indentures governing our notes, was $951.5 million, which included $37.9 million of savings from announced cost reduction initiatives so that the impact of the cost reduction initiatives is fully reflected in the twelve-month period used in the calculation of the ratios. In addition to limitations under these indentures, our senior secured credit facilities contain customary negative covenants.

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are determined based upon management's valuation and involves making significant estimates and assumptions based on facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. We use a measurement period following the acquisition date to gather information that existed as of the acquisition date that is needed to determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

million on the 2022 Term Loan. In connection with the debt redeemed or repaid in 2016, we paid redemption premiums of $17.7 million and other fees of $1.2 million. Also during 2016, we received proceeds of $16.8 million related to the exercise of stock options and employees surrendered 143,000 shares of our common stock to satisfy their tax withholding requirements on vested restricted stock units, which reduced cash flows by $3.9 million.\nCMS segment operating income and non-GAAP adjusted operating income decreased for 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to lower sales volumes, price reductions and unfavorable geographic mix, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. The decrease in CMS segment operating income for 2017 compared to 2016 was partially offset by lower intangible amortization and restructuring costs. Non-GAAP adjusted operating income excludes the impacts of intangible amortization and restructuring costs.\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,767.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,029.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (261.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As a percent of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SG&A expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 795.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 881.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (86.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As a percent of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> R&D expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 185.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 201.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As a percent of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following is a summary of our results for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year:\nThe effective income tax rate of 17.9% for 2018 was lower than the statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to a reduction in tax expense of $23.3 million related to the expiration of statutes of limitations on various uncertain tax positions, the $7.8 million benefit recorded for changes to the provisional amounts as indicated above and the favorable impact of $4.6 million of excess tax benefits related to equity-based compensation awards for 2018. These decreases to the effective tax rate were partially offset by an increase in tax expense due to the effect of the provision for state income taxes, the impact of earnings in foreign jurisdictions that are taxed at rates higher than the U.S., the impact of the new U.S. anti-deferral provisions and the impact of repatriation taxes.\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended

Restructuring costs, net for 2018 were related to the continuing integration of the BNS business and a voluntary retirement program in the U.S. that was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2018. Restructuring costs, net for 2017 were primarily related to the continuing integration of the BNS business. No significant additional restructuring charges are expected to be incurred to complete the previously announced BNS integration initiatives. From a cash perspective, we paid $42.1 million to settle restructuring liabilities during 2018. We expect to pay $29.9 million in 2019 and $5.2 million between 2020 and 2022 related to restructuring actions that have been initiated. Additional restructuring actions may be identified and the resulting charges and cash requirements may be material.\nNote: Components may not sum to total due to rounding\nGross profit, SG&A expense and R&D expense\nNet sales\nOur future financial condition and performance will be largely dependent upon: global spending by wireless operators; global spending by business enterprises on information technology; investment by cable operators and communications companies in video and communications infrastructure; overall global business conditions; and our ability to manage costs successfully across our global operations. Our profitability is also affected by the mix and volume of sales among our various product groups and between domestic and international customers and competitive pricing pressures.\n\nWe maintain reserves to reduce the value of inventory based on the lower of cost or net realizable value, including allowances for excess and obsolete inventory. These reserves are based on management's assumptions about and analysis of relevant factors including current levels of orders and backlog, forecasted demand, market conditions and new products or innovations that diminish the value of existing inventories. If actual market conditions deteriorate from those anticipated by management, additional allowances for excess and obsolete inventory could be required and may be material to earnings.\nAsset Impairment Reviews\nIncome tax expense. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted tax reform legislation (U.S. tax reform) that reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and included a broad range of complex provisions affecting the taxation of businesses. Generally, financial statement recognition of the new legislation would be required to be completed in the period of enactment; however, in response to the complexities of this new legislation, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 to provide companies with transitional relief. Specifically, while the initial accounting for items under the new legislation was incomplete, the guidance allowed the recognition of provisional amounts when reasonable estimates could be made or the continued application of the prior tax law if a reasonable estimate of the effect could not be made. The SEC staff provided up to one year for companies to finalize the accounting for the effects of this new legislation. During 2018, we recognized $7.8 million of tax benefit related to changes made to the provisional amounts, primarily related to our transition tax and from revaluing our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nDuring 2017, we paid $7.6 million to settle a net investment hedge that we entered into in 2017 for the purpose of mitigating a portion of the foreign currency risk on the euro net investment in a foreign subsidiary. As of December 31, 2017, we had entered into another net investment hedge intended to mitigate the same risk with an outstanding maturity of twelve months.\n \u2022 Diluted earnings per share decreased 26.5%. \nWe also recognize revenue from other customer contract types, including licensing of intellectual property, software licensing and post-contract support (PCS) which may be sold as part of a bundled product offering or as a separate contract. For bundled product arrangements, the transaction price is allocated based on the relative standalone estimated selling price of each performance obligation. Distinct intellectual property obligations, including software, are considered functional in nature and are recognized as revenue at the point in time the customer receives the rights to use and benefit from the intellectual property or are determined using a usage-based royalty. PCS obligations are typically recognized over the term of the contract.\nWe establish deferred tax liabilities for the estimated tax cost associated with foreign earnings that we do not consider permanently reinvested (primarily foreign withholding and state income taxes). These liabilities are subject to adjustment if there is a change in the assertion of whether the foreign earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested.\n \n (1) See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\u201d within this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below. \nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense for 2018 was lower than 2017 due primarily to benefits from cost reduction initiatives and lower costs related to the integration of the Broadband Network Solutions (BNS) business acquired from TE Connectivity in 2015. These decreases in costs were partially offset by higher transaction costs related to the pending acquisition of ARRIS, higher incentive compensation expense and higher bad debt expense in 2018. SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased from the prior year as a result of these overall net reductions in expense.\nOperating Activities\nDuring 2016, we repaid $150.0 million of our senior secured term loan due in 2018 and voluntarily redeemed $536.6 million of the 6.625%/7.375% senior payment-in-kind toggle notes (the senior PIK toggle notes). In connection with the repayment and redemption, we wrote off $7.1 million of debt issuance costs and original issue discount to interest expense during 2016.\nWe record a contract asset for unbilled accounts receivable related to revenue that has been recognized in advance of consideration being unconditionally due from the customer, which is common for certain project contract performance obligations. Contract asset amounts are transferred to accounts receivable when our right to the consideration becomes unconditional, which varies by contract, but is generally based on achieving certain acceptance milestones.\nComparison of results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 with the year ended December 31, 2017\nGross profit, SG&A expense and R&D expense\n\nWe believe that presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures enhances an investor's understanding of our financial performance. We further believe that these financial measures are useful in assessing our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business. We also use certain of these financial measures for business planning purposes and in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors. We believe these financial measures are commonly used by investors to evaluate our performance and the performance of our competitors. However, our use of the terms non-GAAP adjusted operating income and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA may vary from that of others in our industry. These financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to operating income (loss), net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP as measures of operating performance, operating cash flows or liquidity.\nDuring 2018, we generated $494.1 million of cash through operating activities compared to $586.3 million during 2017. The lower level of cash generation was primarily due to lower earnings, increases in cash used to build inventory and higher cash payments for interest and taxes. The decreases were offset partially by lower payments of incentive compensation compared with the prior year.\nAdopted in 2018\nNet periodic benefit income of $9.1 million, excluding the amounts discussed above, was included in other expense, net for 2018 as a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. Other expense, net for 2017 was recast to include $5.6 million of net periodic benefit income as a result of the new guidance. See the discussion under Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding the adoption of this new accounting guidance.\nNet sales. Net sales for 2017 were lower across all regions compared to the prior year except the EMEA region, with the U.S. and APAC region having the largest declines. Net sales to customers located outside of the U.S. comprised 46% of total net sales for both 2017 and 2016. Foreign exchange rate changes did not significantly impact net sales for 2017 compared to 2016.\n (a) No prepayment or redemption of any of our long-term debt balances has been assumed. Refer to Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding the terms of our long-term debt agreements. \nForeign exchange losses of $8.7 million were included in other expense, net for 2017 compared to losses of $9.5 million for 2016.\nDuring 2018 and 2017, we sold property and equipment no longer being utilized for $12.9 million and $5.4 million, respectively.\n\nOther expense, net. In connection with the redemption of the 2020 Notes during 2017, we paid a redemption premium of $14.8 million which was included in other expense, net. In May 2017, we amended the 2022 Term Loan to reduce the interest rate margin, and in connection with the amendment, we incurred debt modification costs of $1.1 million which were included in other expense, net for 2017. In connection with the debt redeemed or repaid during 2016, we incurred redemption premiums of $17.7 million and other fees of $1.2 million which were included in other expense, net.\nDuring 2017, we acquired Cable Exchange and paid $105.2 million, net of cash acquired, using cash on hand. Also during 2017, we received proceeds of $9.9 million related to the sale of the remainder of our investment in Hydrogenics.\nNet interest expense, Other expense, net and Income taxes\nCCS segment operating income and non-GAAP adjusted operating income decreased for 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to lower sales volumes, price reductions, unfavorable geographic and product mix and higher material costs. These decreases were partially offset by the favorable impact of cost reduction initiatives and lower incentive compensation. The decrease in CCS segment operating income was also partially offset by lower intangible asset amortization, lower impairment charges and lower integration and transaction costs during 2017 compared to 2016. The impacts of intangible asset amortization, impairment charges and integration and transaction costs are excluded from the calculation of non-GAAP adjusted operating income.\nIn July 2018, we repaid $400.0 million of the 2022 Term Loan. The payment was made using $250.0 million of cash on hand and $150.0 million borrowed under our asset-based revolving credit facility (the revolving credit facility) which was repaid during the third quarter of 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the remaining availability was $463.1 million, reflecting a borrowing base of $492.6 million reduced by $29.5 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility. During 2018, we received proceeds of $6.1 million related to the exercise of stock options. Also during 2018, employees surrendered 407,938 shares of our common stock to satisfy their tax withholding requirements on vested restricted stock units and performance share units, which reduced cash flows by $15.7 million.\nWe are a global provider of infrastructure solutions for communication networks.

Vital networks around the world run on CommScope solutions.\nCCS segment net sales were lower in 2017 compared to 2016 in all regions except the EMEA region. The decrease was driven by the U.S. and the APAC region as a result of a slowdown in the rollout of new projects by certain North American service providers, continued weakness in demand for our indoor network products, and certain large projects in the APAC region in 2016 that did not recur in 2017. In addition, we experienced BNS integration issues early in 2017 that negatively affected customer service levels and order rates. Incremental sales related to the Cable Exchange acquisition completed in August 2017 were not material to the CCS segment for 2017. Foreign exchange rate changes did not significantly impact segment sales for 2017 compared to 2016.\nWe adopted ASU No. 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, on January 1, 2018. The new standard requires an employer to report the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the employee and requires the other components of net periodic benefit cost to be reported outside the subtotal of operating income. Of the total $19.8 million of net periodic benefit cost for year ended December 31, 2018, $15.7 million of net periodic benefit cost was recorded in other expense, net, and $4.1 million of net periodic benefit cost was recorded within operating income. We utilized the practical expedient and used the amounts disclosed in our employee benefit plans note for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 as the basis for applying the retrospective presentation requirements. We reclassified $5.6 million and $7.1 million of net periodic benefit income from operating income to other expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on the previously reported income before income taxes or net income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nDuring 2018 and 2017, we received $5.1 million and paid $7.6 million, respectively, to settle net investment hedges that we entered into for the purpose of mitigating a portion of the foreign currency risk on the euro net investment in a foreign subsidiary.\nWe establish an income tax valuation allowance when available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider the amounts, character, source and timing of expected future deductions or carryforwards as well as sources of taxable income and tax planning strategies that may enable utilization. We maintain an existing valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal. Changes in the amount or timing of expected future deductions or taxable income may have a material impact on the level of income tax valuation allowances. If we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of a deferred tax asset in the future, an increase to an income tax valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made.\nNet sales\nWe adopted ASU No. 2016-16, Accounting for Income Taxes, Intra-Entity Asset Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory, on January 1, 2018. Under previous guidance, the tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers were deferred until the transferred asset was sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use. The new guidance eliminates the exception for all intra-entity sales of assets other than inventory. As a result, the tax effect of an intra-entity asset sale would be recognized when the transfer occurs. We recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $2.6 million as of January 1, 2018 that decreased the accumulated deficit on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a result of this new guidance.\n\nProduct Warranty Reserves\nCCS Segment\nOur effective income tax rate of 7.6% for 2017 reflected the impact of U.S. tax reform enacted in December 2017. Our effective income tax rate was also favorably affected by changes in tax legislation in certain other jurisdictions and a reduction in tax expense related to the expiration of statutes of limitations on various uncertain tax positions. In addition, the effective tax rate was favorably affected by $14.4 million of excess tax benefits related to equity-based compensation awards for 2017.\nThe following table summarizes certain key measures of our liquidity and capital resources:\n\n</table>\nTax Valuation Allowances and Liabilities for Unrecognized Tax Benefits\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n (1) See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\" within this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below. \nImpairment Reviews of Goodwill\nOur sales to wireless operators are volatile. We expect longer-term demand for our CMS products to be positively affected by wireless coverage and capacity expansion in emerging markets and growth in mobile data services and network capacity requirements in developed markets. In addition, we expect demand for our CMS products to continue to be favorably affected by government initiatives to promote the expansion of wireless networks (e.g., FirstNet), new spectrum deployments (e.g., Citizen's Broadband Radio Service or CBRS) and a venue refresh cycle over the next couple of years. We also expect longer-term demand for our CMS products to be positively affected by the introduction of 5G technology. In preparation for 5G networks, we continue to invest heavily in R&D, support customer trials and participate in industry forums to help shape 5G standards. Uncertainty in the global economy or a particular region or consolidation among or other investments by wireless operators may slow the growth or cause a decline in capital spending by wireless operators and negatively impact our net sales. We expect modest near-term net sales growth in the CMS segment as a result of these business dynamics as well as ongoing pricing pressure.\nComparison for the year ended December 31, 2017 with the year ended December 31, 2016\nInvesting Activities\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the first half of 2017, we paid cash of $100.0 million to repurchase stock under the stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in February 2017. We had no remaining authorization under this stock repurchase program as of December 31, 2017. In August 2017, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase plan of up to $100.0 million. We paid cash of $75.0 million to repurchase stock under this plan during 2017. We had $25.0 million of remaining authorization under this stock repurchase program as of December 31, 2017. The repurchase authorization under this plan expired on July 31, 2018.\nNM - Not meaningful\nThe following critical accounting policies and estimates reflected in our financial statements are based on management's knowledge of and experience with past and current events and on management's assumptions about future events. While we have generally not experienced significant deviations from our critical estimates in the past, it is reasonably possible that these estimates may ultimately differ materially from actual results. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of all of our significant accounting policies.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test of Goodwill Impairment, which eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under the new guidance, an entity will perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity will recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. ASU No. 2017-04 is effective for us as of January 1, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. We plan to adopt this new guidance as of January 1, 2019 and do not anticipate that adoption will materially affect the consolidated financial statements.\n\nSegment Results\nInvestment in property, plant and equipment during 2018 was $82.3 million compared with $68.7 million for the prior year. The investment in property, plant and equipment was primarily related to supporting improvements in manufacturing operations, including expanding production capacity and investing in information technology, including software developed for internal use.\nOperating Activities\nThe change in other expense, net for 2018 compared to the prior year was also impacted by a redemption premium of $14.8 million incurred during the first quarter of 2017 in connection with the redemption of the 2020 Notes, partially offset by $9.0 million in gains recognized during 2017 related to the sale of our investment in Hydrogenics Corporation.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\n\n</td> </tr>\nThe annual test of goodwill was performed for each of the reporting units with goodwill balances as of October 1, 2018. The weighted average discount rates used in the 2018 annual test were 9.5% for the CCS reporting units and 10.0% for the CMS reporting units. These discount rates were unchanged from those used in the 2017 annual goodwill impairment tests. Based on the estimated fair values generated by our DCF models, the reporting units passed the annual goodwill impairment test. The Company considered the sensitivity to changes in key assumptions for the reporting unit with the lowest level of headroom and determined that a fifty basis point change in the discount rate or long-term growth rate would result in a potential impairment. Accordingly, if performance is worse than anticipated, future impairment tests could result in impairment charges that could be material to our results of operations.\n (2) Total capitalization includes long-term debt, including the current portion, and stockholders' equity. \nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we early adopted ASU No. 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which allows companies to elect reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for certain tax effects resulting from the U.S. tax legislation enacted in 2017. Our policy is to generally recognize the tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income at the currently enacted tax rate and reclassify it to net income in the same period that the related pre-tax accumulated comprehensive income reclassifications are recognized. We did not elect the permitted reclassification and therefore adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome tax expense. Our effective income tax rate of 7.6% for 2017 reflected the impact of U.S. tax reform enacted in December 2017. Our effective income tax rate was also favorably affected by changes in tax legislation in certain other jurisdictions and a reduction in tax expense related to the expiration of statutes of limitations on various uncertain tax positions. The effective tax rate was also favorably affected by $14.4 million of excess tax benefits related to equity-based compensation awards for 2017.\n (a) Reflects integration costs related to the acquisition of the BNS business, transaction costs related to potential and consummated acquisitions and costs related to secondary stock offerings. \nWorking capital, excluding cash and cash equivalents, decreased during 2018. The decrease was mainly due to lower accounts receivable balances due to the timing of net sales. This decrease was partially offset by lower accounts payable balances and higher inventory balances as of December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. The net reduction in total capitalization during 2018 reflected the repayment of $400.0 million on the 2022 Term Loan and foreign currency translation losses partially offset by current year earnings.\n\n \u2022 Net income decreased 27.7%; and \nAmortization of purchased intangible assets, Restructuring costs and Asset impairments\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under \"Risk Factors\" included in Part I, Item 1A or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur principal sources of liquidity on a short-term basis are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows provided by operations and availability under credit facilities. Refer to Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding the terms of our credit agreements as of December 31, 2018. To fund the Pending Acquisition, on February 19, 2019 we issued $1.25 billion of 5.50% senior secured notes due 2024, $1.5 billion of 6.00% senior secured notes due 2026 and $1.0 billion of 8.25% senior unsecured notes due 2027 and priced the borrowing of $3.2 billion under a new senior secured term loan due 2026 with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.25%. The proceeds of the notes were placed into escrow and will be released upon consummation of the Pending Acquisition, and it is expected that the new senior secured term loan will be borrowed at closing of the Pending Acquisition. We expect to use a portion of the new senior secured term loan to pay off our existing senior secured term loan due December 2022. We also expect to enter into a new asset-based revolving credit facility in an amount of up to $1.0 billion, subject to borrowing base capacity. In addition to the new debt, we expect to fund the Pending Acquisition by issuing 1.0 million shares of series A convertible preferred stock to the Carlyle Group for $1,000 per share, or an aggregate investment of $1.0 billion. On a long-term basis, our potential sources of liquidity include raising capital through additional issuances of debt and/or equity.\nWe also establish allowances related to value-added and similar recoverable taxes when it is considered probable that those assets are not recoverable. Changes in the probability of recovery or in the estimates of the amount recoverable are recognized in the period such determination is made and may be material to earnings.\nIn August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2018-15, Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement (CCA) that is a Service Contract, which aligns the accounting for costs incurred to implement a CCA that is a service arrangement with the guidance on capitalizing costs associated with developing or obtaining internal-use software. ASU No. 2018-15 is effective for us as of January 1, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact of the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements and when it will be adopted.\nCommScope Mobility Solutions Segment\nWe continually attempt to minimize the effect of inflation on earnings by controlling our operating costs and adjusting our selling prices. The principal raw materials purchased by us (copper, aluminum, steel, plastics and other polymers, bimetals and optical fiber) are subject to changes in market price as they are influenced by commodity markets and other factors. Prices for copper, fluoropolymers and certain other polymers derived from oil and natural gas have, at times, been volatile. As a result, we have adjusted our prices for certain products and may have to adjust prices again in the future. To the extent that we are unable to pass on cost increases to customers without a significant decrease in sales volume or must implement price reductions in response to a rapid decline in raw material costs, these cost changes could have a material adverse impact on the results of our operations.\nContractual Obligations\nSelling, general and administrative expense. SG&A expense for 2017 was lower than 2016 due primarily to lower incentive compensation expense and benefits from cost reduction initiatives. Despite lower net sales, SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased from 2016 as a result of these lower costs.\nWe adopted ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, on January 1, 2018. This new guidance modifies how entities measure equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting) and present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities; simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment; changes presentation and disclosure requirements; and clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity's other deferred tax assets. Adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n (1) See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\" in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below. \n\n\nWe adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, including all subsequently issued clarifying guidance, on January 1, 2018. The core principle of the new guidance is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. We adopted the standard using the modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of applying the standard on the date of adoption recognized in retained earnings (accumulated deficit).\nForeign exchange losses of $29.9 million were included in other expense, net for 2018 compared to foreign exchange losses of $8.7 million for 2017. The 2018 amount included a $14.0 million pretax loss related to foreign currency translation adjustments previously reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss that were recognized in other expense, net due to the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary.\nCMS segment operating income and non-GAAP adjusted operating income decreased in 2018 primarily due to selling price reductions and unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes impacting costs, partially offset by favorable product and geographic mix and higher sales volumes. CMS segment operating income was also impacted by higher restructuring costs and the impairment of our equity investment in a privately-owned entity in 2018, which are both excluded from non-GAAP adjusted operating income. See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\u201d within this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below.\nCommScope Connectivity Solutions Segment\n\nIssued but Not Adopted\nDuring 2017, we generated $586.3 million of cash through operating activities compared to $640.2 million during 2016. The lower level of cash generation was primarily due to the prior year benefit generated from the extension of vendor payment terms as well as higher 2016 incentive compensation which was paid in 2017 and lower operating performance in 2017 compared to 2016. These declines were partially offset by higher cash flow from accounts receivable due to changes in the timing of sales and collections as well as approximately $59.2 million of customer payments received in late 2017 that were not due until 2018. In addition, we paid lower cash taxes and cash interest during 2017 than in 2016.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The new guidance replaces the current incurred loss method used for determining credit losses on financial assets, including trade receivables, with an expected credit loss method. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for us as of January 1, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact of the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 Operating income decreased 4.7%; \nAmortization of purchased intangible assets. The amortization of purchased intangible assets was lower for 2017 compared to 2016 primarily because certain of our intangible assets became fully amortized. This was partially offset by the amortization of intangible assets related to the Cable Exchange acquisition.\nCommScope Connectivity Solutions Segment\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe recognize income tax benefits related to particular tax positions only when it is considered more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained if examined on its technical merits by tax authorities. The amount of benefit recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is evaluated to be greater than 50% likely to be realized. Considerable judgment is required to evaluate the technical merits of various positions and to evaluate the likely amount of benefit to be realized. Lapses in statutes of limitations, developments in tax laws, regulations and interpretations, and changes in assessments of the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions could have a material impact on the overall tax provision.\nOur effective income tax rate of 18.2% for 2016 was lower than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to a reduction in tax expense related to the release of valuation allowances related to certain federal tax credit carryforwards and certain other deferred tax assets. The effective income tax rate was also favorably affected by the reduction of reserves for uncertain tax positions and earnings in foreign jurisdictions that we did not plan to repatriate. These foreign earnings were generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S. Offsetting these decreases in 2016 was the effect of the provision for state income taxes as well as the goodwill impairment charge for which only partial tax benefits were recorded.\nWe expect demand for our indoor network CCS products to be driven by global information technology spending, particularly for hyperscale and cloud data center networks, as the ongoing need for bandwidth and intelligence in the network continues to create demand for high-performance connectivity solutions. We expect demand for our outdoor network CCS products to be driven by global deployment of fiber-optic solutions for fiber-to-the-X applications, new services, densification, competitive dynamics in the access market, ongoing maintenance requirements of cable networks and residential construction market activity in North America. Spending patterns by service providers and data center customers can be volatile. Uncertain global economic conditions, variability in the levels of commercial and residential construction activity, consolidation among service providers, uncertain levels of information technology spending and reductions in the levels of distributor inventories may negatively affect demand for our products. The increasing demand for fiber solutions is expected to be somewhat offset by decelerating demand for copper solutions in networks. We expect modest near-term net sales growth in the CCS segment as a result of these business dynamics as well as ongoing pricing pressure.\nInvesting Activities\n (b) Interest on long-term debt excludes the amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount. Interest on variable rate debt is estimated based upon rates in effect as of December 31, 2018. \nOther expense, net. In 2018, we terminated a significant U.S. defined benefit pension plan which was settled through the purchase of annuities. As a result of the settlement, we recognized a pretax charge in other expense, net primarily related to unrecognized net actuarial losses previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $34.5 million. We also amended certain of our U.S. postretirement medical plans to terminate benefits as of December 31, 2018. We recognized a pretax gain in other expense, net in 2018 of $9.7 million related to unrecognized prior service credits and unrecognized net actuarial gains previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nRestructuring costs, net. The restructuring costs for 2017 and 2016 were primarily related to the continuing integration of the BNS acquisition.\nDuring 2017, we received proceeds of $9.9 million related to the exercise of stock options. Also during 2017, employees surrendered 411,932 shares of our common stock to satisfy their tax withholding requirements on vested restricted stock units and performance share units, which reduced cash flows by $15.4 million.\n (1) See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\u201d within this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below. \nCMS segment net sales were relatively unchanged during 2018 compared to 2017. The CMS segment saw higher sales volumes in the U.S. primarily as a result of government initiatives to promote the expansion of wireless networks. The increase in U.S. sales volumes was offset partially by reductions in certain selling prices. The increase in CMS segment net sales in the U.S. was largely offset by decreases in the APAC region. Foreign exchange rate changes were not significant to CMS segment net sales for 2018.\n (1) Working capital consists of current assets of $1,877.8 million less current liabilities of $690.6 million as of December 31, 2018 and current assets of $1,943.9 million less current liabilities of $723.7 million as of December 31, 2017. \n (d) Amounts reflect expected contributions related to payments under the postretirement benefit plans through 2028 and expected pension contributions of $5.0 million in 2019 (see Note 10 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). \n2018 Annual Goodwill Analysis\nCCS segment operating income increased during 2018 compared to the prior year while non-GAAP adjusted operating income decreased slightly. CCS segment operating income benefitted from lower integration costs and restructuring costs offset by the impairment of our equity investment in a privately-owned entity in 2018, all of which are excluded from non-GAAP adjusted operating income. Both operating income and non-GAAP adjusted operating income benefitted from higher sales volumes, favorable product and geographic mix and cost savings initiatives that were partially offset by selling price reductions, higher material costs and unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes impacting costs. See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\u201d within this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below.\n (f) Due to the uncertainty in predicting the timing of tax payments related to our unrecognized tax benefits, $17.3 million has been excluded from the presentation. We anticipate a reduction of up to $5.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months (see Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). \nCash Flow Overview\nNet interest expense, Other expense, net and Income taxes\nOn November 8, 2018, we announced that we have entered into an agreement to acquire ARRIS International plc (ARRIS) (the Pending Acquisition) in an all cash transaction with a total purchase price of approximately $7.4 billion, or $31.75 per outstanding ARRIS share. We expect the transaction to close during the first half of 2019. See Part I, Item 1, Business-Strategy-ARRIS Acquisition Rationale\u201d for a discussion of strategy behind the acquisition of ARRIS and see Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors-ARRIS Acquisition Risks\u201d for a discussion of risks related to the pending acquisition of ARRIS.\nFinancing Activities\nSegment Results\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets, Restructuring costs and Asset impairments\nManagement reviews definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable. This analysis differs from our goodwill impairment analysis in that an intangible or other long-lived asset impairment is only deemed to have occurred if the sum of the forecasted undiscounted future net cash flows related to the assets being evaluated is less than the carrying value of the assets. If the forecasted net cash flows are less than the carrying value, then the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. During 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of $15.0 million allocated equally to the CCS and CMS segments related to our equity investment in a privately-held company. Other than this equity investment impairment and other certain assets abandoned or disposed of as part of restructuring actions, we did not identify any other impairments of definite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived assets in 2018. Changes in the estimates of forecasted net cash flows may result in future asset impairments that could be material to our results of operations.\nWe adopted ASU No. 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, on January 1, 2018. The new guidance provides targeted improvements to the hedge accounting model intended to allow financial reporting to more closely reflect an entity's risk management activities and to simplify the application of hedge accounting. Beginning January 1, 2018, we elected to assess the effectiveness of our net investment hedges using the spot rate method. As a result, differences between the spot rate and the forward rate will be amortized to earnings on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract. See Note 7 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10- K for further details on our derivative and hedging activities and the related impacts to the financial statements.\nResearch and development. R&D expense decreased for 2017 compared to 2016 primarily as a result of lower incentive compensation expense. R&D expense as a percentage of sales remained unchanged from 2016.\n (c) Purchase obligations and other supplier agreements include payments of $21.7 million due in 2019 for minimum amounts owed under take-or-pay or requirements contracts. Amounts covered by open purchase orders are excluded as there is no contractual obligation until goods or services are received. This item also includes $11.1 million and $3.6 million of purchase price payments due in 2019 and 2020, respectively, related to the acquisition of Cable Exchange. \nITEM 7.\nDuring 2017, we received proceeds of $9.9 million related to the sale of the remainder of our investment in Hydrogenics. During 2016, we received $1.3 million in proceeds related to the sale of a portion of that investment.\n \u2022 Net sales were essentially flat with an increase of less than 1%; \nCMS Segment\nOVERVIEW\nThe CMS segment experienced a decrease in net sales for 2017 compared to 2016 in all major regions, with the decrease being most pronounced in the U.S. and the APAC region. While CMS segment net sales benefited from increased spending by certain domestic operators in the first quarter of 2017, we saw a slowdown in their spending during the remainder of 2017. The decline in sales of our CMS products in the APAC region was primarily due to certain large projects in 2016 that did not recur during 2017. Foreign exchange rate changes did not significantly impact segment sales for 2017 compared to 2016.\nWe report financial performance based on two operating segments: CommScope Connectivity Solutions (CCS) and CommScope Mobility Solutions (CMS). For an overview of our operating segments, see Part I, Item I Business - Operating Segments.\u201d\nFor project contracts containing multiple distinct performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated based on the relative standalone estimated selling price of each performance obligation. The relative standalone selling price is determined using current price lists and observable pricing in separate contracts with similar customers. For performance obligations recognized over-time, judgment is required to evaluate assumptions, including the total estimated costs to determine progress towards completion of the performance obligation and to calculate the corresponding amount of revenue to recognize. If estimated total costs on any contract are greater than the net contract revenues, the entire estimated loss is recognized in the period the loss becomes known. The cumulative effects on revenue from revisions to total estimated costs are recorded in the period in which the revisions to estimates are identified and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.\nRevenue Recognition\nNM - Not meaningful\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled, based on customer contracts. For sales to distributors, system integrators and value-added resellers (primarily for CCS segment), revenue is adjusted for variable consideration amounts, including estimated discounts, returns, rebates and distributor price protection programs. These estimates are determined based upon historical experience, contract terms, inventory levels in the distributor channel and other related factors. Adjustments to variable consideration estimates are recorded when circumstances indicate revisions may be necessary.\nWe recognize revenue based on the satisfaction of distinct obligations to transfer goods and services to customers. The majority of our revenue is from product sales. Revenue from product sales is recognized when control is transferred to the customer, typically upon either shipment or delivery. A minor portion of our revenue is derived from project contracts containing a combination of product and service obligations. Revenue from project contracts is recognized either at a point in time or over time using cost input methods, based on the specific terms of each contract.\nFrom a segment perspective, net sales from the CCS segment and the CMS segment in 2018 were both relatively unchanged compared to 2017. CCS segment net sales in the EMEA region and in the U.S. both increased but these were mostly offset by decreases in the APAC region. Net sales from the CMS segment increased in the U.S. but that increase was mostly offset by decreases in the APAC region.

Deferred revenue balances typically result from advance payments received from customers for product contracts or from billings in excess of revenue recognized on project or services arrangements.\nInvestment in property, plant and equipment during 2017 was $68.7 million compared with $68.3 million for the prior year. The investment in property, plant and equipment was primarily related to supporting improvements in manufacturing operations, including expanding production capacity and investing in information technology, including software developed for internal use.\nDefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nOur weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings, including the amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount, was 5.45% at December 31, 2017 and 5.24% at December 31, 2016.\n (e) Future restructuring payments exclude payments due under lease arrangements which are included in operating leases above. \nDuring 2017, we issued the 2027 Notes for $750.0 million and the proceeds, together with cash on hand, were used to (i) redeem all $500.0 million of the outstanding 2020 Notes, (ii) repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our senior secured term loans, including $111.9 million of outstanding principal on our senior secured term loan due 2018 and $138.1 million of outstanding principal on the 2022 Term Loan, and (iii) pay related fees and expenses. We paid a $14.8 million premium to redeem the 2020 Notes and paid $7.2 million in debt issuance costs related to the 2027 Notes. In addition, during 2017, we amended the 2022 Term Loan to reduce the interest rate margin by 50 basis points which resulted in the repayment of $30.4 million to certain lenders under the senior secured credit facilities and the receipt of $30.4 million in proceeds from the new lenders and existing lenders who increased their positions. We also paid $1.1 million in debt modification costs related to this amendment. Also during 2017, we voluntarily repaid $210.0 million of the 2022 Term Loan. During 2017, we paid cash of $175.0 million to repurchase stock under stock repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors in 2017. The repurchase authorization expired on July 31, 2018. In addition, we received proceeds of $9.9 million related to the exercise of stock options and employees surrendered 411,932 shares of our common stock to satisfy their tax withholding requirements on vested restricted stock units, which reduced cash flows by $15.4 million.\nAsset impairments. During 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of $15.0 million allocated equally to the CCS and CMS segments to fully impair an equity investment in a privately-held company. We did not record any asset impairment charges during 2017.\nWe test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment annually as of October 1 and on an interim basis when events occur or circumstances indicate the carrying value may no longer be recoverable. The goodwill impairment test starts with a comparison of the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value. We estimate the fair value of a reporting unit through the use of a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation model. The significant assumptions in the DCF model are the annual revenue growth rate, the annual operating income margin and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flow projections. Among other inputs, the annual revenue growth rate and operating income margin are determined by management using historical performance trends, industry data, insight derived from customers, relevant changes in the reporting unit's underlying business and other market trends that may affect the reporting unit. The discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital as of the test date of market participants in the industry in which the reporting unit operates. The assumptions used in the DCF model are subject to significant judgment and uncertainty. Changes in projected revenue growth rates, projected operating income margins or estimated discount rates due to uncertain market conditions, loss of one or more key customers, changes in technology, or other factors, could result in one or more of our reporting units with a significant amount of goodwill failing the goodwill impairment test in the future. It is possible that future impairment reviews may indicate additional impairments of goodwill, which could be material to our results of operations and financial position. Our historical or projected revenues or cash flows may not be indicative of actual future results.\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td>\n\nEffects of Inflation and Changing Prices\nConsolidated\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets. The amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased for 2018 compared to the prior year because certain of our intangible assets became fully amortized. This decrease was partially offset during 2018 by the amortization of intangible assets related to the Cable Exchange acquisition that occurred in August 2017.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we early adopted ASU No. 2018-14, Disclosure Framework: Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans, which adds disclosure requirements identified as relevant for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans, removes disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial, and clarifies existing guidance for certain disclosure requirements. The impact on our disclosures was to remove the disclosure of the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss expected to be recognized as net periodic benefit cost in the next year and to provide explanations of significant gains and losses related to the changes in the benefit obligation for the period. The impacts were applied retrospectively to the disclosures for all periods presented. The adoption of this ASU only affected the disclosures on our defined benefit pension plans and did not affect our consolidated financial statements. See Note 10 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10- K for further discussion of our defined benefit pension plans.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which supersedes the current leasing guidance in Topic 840, Leases. Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize assets and lease liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leased assets previously classified as operating leases. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for us as of January 1, 2019. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, which allows entities a transition election to recognize the effects of applying the new leasing standard as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings (accumulated deficit) as opposed to restating comparative periods for the effects of applying the new standard. We expect to elect this transition approach. We are finalizing the necessary changes to our accounting policies, processes, internal controls and information systems that will be required to meet the new standard's reporting and disclosure requirements. The majority of our leased asset value relates to real estate with the remainder primarily related to vehicles and equipment. We estimate that adoption of the new standard will increase total assets and total liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets by $95 million to $100 million due to the addition of right-of-use assets and lease obligations for operating type leases, net of the elimination of existing prepaid rent, deferred rent and lease termination cost amounts. We do not expect the adoption of the new standard to significantly affect the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income or the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nInventory Reserves\nDuring 2017, we acquired Cable Exchange and paid $105.2 million, net of cash acquired, using cash on hand. We recorded a noncurrent liability for the remaining $14.5 million of payments due to the sellers. During 2016, we received adjustments to the BNS acquisition purchase price of $7.1 million and paid $1.0 million as a final payment on a previous acquisition.\n\nNet sales. Net sales for 2018 were essentially flat compared to 2017. Net sales in the U.S. and the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region increased in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase in the U.S. was driven by higher sales volumes primarily as a result of government initiatives to promote the expansion of wireless networks but was partially offset by reductions in certain selling prices. Net sales in the U.S. also benefitted from incremental net sales in 2018 related to the acquisition of Cable Exchange on August 1, 2017. The increase in net sales in the EMEA region for 2018 was driven mostly by favorable foreign exchange rate changes. These increases in net sales were largely offset by decreases in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region as a result of projects in 2017 that did not recur in 2018. Net sales in the Caribbean and Latin America (CALA) region also decreased in 2018 with higher sales volumes being more than offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes. Net sales to customers located outside of the U.S. comprised 44% for 2018 compared to 46% for 2017.\nNet interest expense. Net interest expense for 2018 decreased due to lower long-term debt balances as a result of the voluntary repayments in the fourth quarter of 2017 and in July 2018 on the senior secured term loan due 2022 (the 2022 Term Loan) as well as the May 2017 amendment to reduce the interest rate margin on the 2022 Term Loan. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in LIBOR. In connection with the repayment of the 2022 Term Loan in July 2018, we wrote off $7.4 million of debt issuance costs and original issue discount. Similarly, in 2017, we wrote off $14.1 million of debt issuance costs and original issue discount in connection with the redemption of $500.0 million of 4.375% senior secured notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes) and the repayment of $460.0 million of senior secured term loans. The redemption of the 2020 Notes and the repayment of the senior secured term loans were substantially funded by the issuance in March 2017 of $750.0 million of 5.00% senior notes due 2027 (the 2027 Notes).\nDuring 2017, we amended the 2022 Term Loan to reduce the interest rate margin by 50 basis points which resulted in the repayment of $30.4 million to certain lenders under the senior secured credit facilities and the receipt of $30.4 million in proceeds from the new lenders and existing lenders who increased their positions. We also paid $1.1 million in debt modification costs related to this amendment. In addition, we voluntarily repaid $210.0 million of the 2022 Term Loan during 2017.\nWe are not a party to any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, except for operating leases. There have not been any material changes to our off-balance sheet arrangements during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nFrom a segment perspective, CCS segment net sales decreased by 5.3% and CMS segment net sales decreased by 10.6% for 2017 compared to the prior year due to lower sales in both domestic and international markets. For further details by segment, see the section titled Segment Results\u201d below.\n", "item_7_text": "\nAsset impairments. We did not record any asset impairment charges during 2017. During 2016, we recorded impairment charges of $15.0 million within the CCS segment due to the revised business plan for a product line that indicated its intangible assets would not be recoverable. Also during 2016, we recorded impairment charges of $8.3 million related to certain long-lived assets acquired with the BNS business that were no longer expected to be utilized in operations within the CCS segment. In addition to these intangible asset and long-lived asset impairment charges, 2016 included a $15.3 million goodwill impairment charge in the CCS segment as a result of the impairment analysis required by the change in reportable segments.\nWe recognize a liability for the estimated claims that may be paid under our customer assurance-type warranty agreements to remedy potential deficiencies of quality or performance of our products. The product warranties extend over periods ranging from one to twenty-five years from the date of sale, depending upon the product subject to the warranty. We record a provision for estimated future warranty claims based upon the historical relationship of warranty claims to sales and specifically identified warranty issues. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revise our estimates, as appropriate, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary. Although these estimates are based on management's knowledge of and experience with past and current events and on management's assumptions about future events, it is reasonably possible that they may ultimately differ materially from actual results, including in the case of a significant product failure.\nGross profit (net sales less cost of sales). The decrease in gross profit for 2017 compared to 2016 was mainly driven by decreases in sales volume, reductions in price, unfavorable geographic and product mix and higher material costs. This decrease was partially offset by the favorable impact of cost reduction initiatives.\n \u2022 Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA decreased 4.7%; \nTo fund the Pending Acquisition, on February 19, 2019 we issued $1.25 billion of 5.50% senior secured notes due 2024, $1.5 billion of 6.00% senior secured notes due 2026 and $1.0 billion of 8.25% senior unsecured notes due 2027 and priced the borrowing of $3.2 billion under a new senior secured term loan due 2026 with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.25%. The proceeds of the notes were placed into escrow and will be released upon consummation of the Pending Acquisition, and it is expected that the new senior secured term loan will be borrowed at closing of the Pending Acquisition. We expect to use a portion of the new senior secured term loan to pay off our existing senior secured term loan due December 2022. We also expect to enter into a new asset-based revolving credit facility in an amount of up to $1.0 billion, subject to borrowing base capacity. In addition to the new debt, we expect to fund the Pending Acquisition by issuing 1.0 million shares of series A convertible preferred stock to the Carlyle Group for $1,000 per share, or an aggregate investment of $1.0 billion.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn addition to funding the pending ARRIS acquisition, the primary uses of liquidity include debt service requirements, funding working capital requirements, capital expenditures, paying restructuring and integration costs, income tax payments and funding pension benefits. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and cash flows from operations, combined with the long-term borrowings incurred for the pending ARRIS acquisition, availability under our current and future revolving credit facility and access to capital markets, will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated future cash needs. We may experience volatility in cash flows between periods due to, among other reasons, variability in the timing of vendor payments and customer receipts. We may, from time to time, borrow under our revolving credit facility or issue securities, if market conditions are favorable, to meet future cash needs or to reduce our borrowing costs.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n \u2022 Non-GAAP adjusted operating income decreased 4.4%; \n\nNet interest expense. The decrease in net interest expense for 2017 as compared to 2016 resulted primarily from decreases in our long-term debt due to our debt redemptions and repayments in 2017 and 2016. Our average long-term debt outstanding decreased by more than $400.0 million for 2017 as compared to 2016. During 2017, the reduction in interest expense was offset partially by the write-off of $14.1 million of debt issuance costs and original issue discount in connection with the redemption of $500.0 million of the 2020 Notes and the prepayment of $460.0 million of senior secured term loans. The redemption of the 2020 Notes and the prepayment of the senior secured term loans were substantially funded by the issuance of the 2027 Notes in March 2017.\n (b) Reflects non-cash charges resulting from the application of acquisition accounting. \nDuring 2017, we sold the remainder of our investment in Hydrogenics resulting in pretax gains of $9.0 million which were recorded in other expense, net. During 2016, sales of Hydrogenics shares resulted in pretax gains of $1.2 million.\nCCS segment net sales were relatively unchanged in 2018 compared to 2017. Net sales increased in the EMEA region primarily due to favorable foreign exchange rate changes for 2018. Net sales also increased in the U.S. for 2018, driven by incremental net sales due to the acquisition of Cable Exchange on August 1, 2017. These increases were mostly offset by reductions in certain selling prices in the U.S. as well as decreases in net sales in the APAC region and in Canada. Despite higher sales volumes, net sales in the CALA region were unchanged in 2018 due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes.\nResearch and development. Research and development (R&D) expense and R&D expense as a percentage of sales were virtually unchanged for 2018 compared to the prior year. R&D activities generally relate to ensuring that our products are capable of meeting the evolving technological needs of our customers, bringing new products to market and modifying existing products to better serve our customers.\n\nRevenue recognition for our product sales remained generally consistent with historical practice. However, the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 resulted in acceleration of revenue recognition for certain project contracts containing integrated product and service obligations, primarily within the CMS segment. These multi-element contracts represented less than 2.0% of total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. For these contracts, certain performance obligations are recognized over time using cost-based input methods, which recognize revenue and cost of sales based on the relationship between actual costs incurred compared to the total estimated cost for the performance obligation. Based on contracts in effect at January 1, 2018, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment, net of tax, of $3.4 million, which reduced the accumulated deficit on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. This adjustment reflects an acceleration of $8.0 million of net sales.\nNM - Not meaningful\nDuring 2017 and 2016, we sold properties no longer being utilized for $4.5 million and $3.7 million, respectively.\n\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States (U.S.). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates and their underlying assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other objective sources. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revises its estimates, as appropriate, when changes in events or circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary.\n\nAlthough there are no financial maintenance covenants under the terms of our senior notes, there is a limitation, among other limitations, on certain future borrowings based on an adjusted leverage ratio or a fixed charge coverage ratio. These ratios are based on financial measures similar to adjusted EBITDA as presented in the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\u201d section below, but also give pro forma effect to certain events, including acquisitions and savings from cost reduction initiatives such as facility closures and headcount reductions. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our pro forma adjusted EBITDA, as measured pursuant to the indentures governing our notes, was $951.5 million, which included $37.9 million of savings from announced cost reduction initiatives so that the impact of the cost reduction initiatives is fully reflected in the twelve-month period used in the calculation of the ratios. In addition to limitations under these indentures, our senior secured credit facilities contain customary negative covenants. We believe we are in compliance with the covenants under our indentures and senior secured credit facilities at December 31, 2018.\nCommScope Mobility Solutions Segment\nCash and cash equivalents increased slightly during 2018. We generated less cash from operations and had higher capital expenditures in 2018 compared to 2017. However, in 2017 we used cash on hand to fund our purchase of Cable Exchange for $105.2 million. In 2018, we made net voluntary repayments of $400.0 million on the 2022 Term Loan while in 2017 we made $210.0 million in voluntary repayments of debt and repurchased $175.0 million of our common stock. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 70% of our cash and cash equivalents were held outside the U.S.\nOur weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings, including the amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount, was 5.73% at December 31, 2018 and 5.45% at December 31, 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe use the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their fair values on the acquisition date. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are determined based upon management's valuation and involves making significant estimates and assumptions based on facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. We use a measurement period following the acquisition date to gather information that existed as of the acquisition date that is needed to determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The measurement period ends once all information is obtained, but no later than one year from the acquisition date.\nComparison of results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 with the year ended December 31, 2016\nBusiness Combinations\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the remaining availability was $425.4 million, reflecting a borrowing base of $452.4 million reduced by $27.0 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility.\nThe impact of adoption of the new revenue recognition standard on the consolidated financial statements was as follows:\nDuring 2016, we voluntarily redeemed the remaining $536.6 million of our senior PIK toggle notes and made mandatory debt repayments of $12.5 million on the 2022 Term Loan. In connection with the debt redeemed or repaid in 2016, we paid redemption premiums of $17.7 million and other fees of $1.2 million. Also during 2016, we received proceeds of $16.8 million related to the exercise of stock options and employees surrendered 143,000 shares of our common stock to satisfy their tax withholding requirements on vested restricted stock units, which reduced cash flows by $3.9 million.\nCMS segment operating income and non-GAAP adjusted operating income decreased for 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to lower sales volumes, price reductions and unfavorable geographic mix, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. The decrease in CMS segment operating income for 2017 compared to 2016 was partially offset by lower intangible amortization and restructuring costs. Non-GAAP adjusted operating income excludes the impacts of intangible amortization and restructuring costs.\nThe following is a summary of our results for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year:\nThe effective income tax rate of 17.9% for 2018 was lower than the statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to a reduction in tax expense of $23.3 million related to the expiration of statutes of limitations on various uncertain tax positions, the $7.8 million benefit recorded for changes to the provisional amounts as indicated above and the favorable impact of $4.6 million of excess tax benefits related to equity-based compensation awards for 2018. These decreases to the effective tax rate were partially offset by an increase in tax expense due to the effect of the provision for state income taxes, the impact of earnings in foreign jurisdictions that are taxed at rates higher than the U.S., the impact of the new U.S. anti-deferral provisions and the impact of repatriation taxes.\nGross profit (net sales less cost of sales). Despite higher sales volumes and favorable product and geographic mix, gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased for 2018, primarily due to reductions in certain selling prices, higher material costs and unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes.\nIn March 2017, we issued the 2027 Notes for $750.0 million and the proceeds, together with cash on hand, were used to (i) redeem all $500.0 million of the outstanding 2020 Notes, (ii) repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our senior secured term loans, including the $111.9 million of outstanding principal on our senior secured term loan due 2018 and $138.1 million of outstanding principal on the 2022 Term Loan, and (iii) pay related fees and expenses. We paid a $14.8 million premium to redeem the 2020 Notes and paid $7.2 million in debt issuance costs related to the 2027 Notes.\nWe include shipping and handling costs billed to customers in net sales and include the costs incurred to transport product to customers as cost of sales. Shipping and handling costs incurred after control is transferred to the customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are not accounted for as separate revenue obligations.\nComparison for the year ended December 31, 2018 with the year ended December 31, 2017\nRestructuring costs, net. Restructuring costs, net for 2018 were related to the continuing integration of the BNS business and a voluntary retirement program in the U.S. that was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2018. Restructuring costs, net for 2017 were primarily related to the continuing integration of the BNS business. No significant additional restructuring charges are expected to be incurred to complete the previously announced BNS integration initiatives. From a cash perspective, we paid $42.1 million to settle restructuring liabilities during 2018. We expect to pay $29.9 million in 2019 and $5.2 million between 2020 and 2022 related to restructuring actions that have been initiated. Additional restructuring actions may be identified and the resulting charges and cash requirements may be material.\nNote: Components may not sum to total due to rounding\nGross profit, SG&A expense and R&D expense\nNet sales\nOur future financial condition and performance will be largely dependent upon: global spending by wireless operators; global spending by business enterprises on information technology; investment by cable operators and communications companies in video and communications infrastructure; overall global business conditions; and our ability to manage costs successfully across our global operations. Our profitability is also affected by the mix and volume of sales among our various product groups and between domestic and international customers and competitive pricing pressures.\n\nWe maintain reserves to reduce the value of inventory based on the lower of cost or net realizable value, including allowances for excess and obsolete inventory. These reserves are based on management's assumptions about and analysis of relevant factors including current levels of orders and backlog, forecasted demand, market conditions and new products or innovations that diminish the value of existing inventories. If actual market conditions deteriorate from those anticipated by management, additional allowances for excess and obsolete inventory could be required and may be material to earnings.\nAsset Impairment Reviews\nIncome tax expense. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted tax reform legislation (U.S. tax reform) that reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and included a broad range of complex provisions affecting the taxation of businesses. Generally, financial statement recognition of the new legislation would be required to be completed in the period of enactment; however, in response to the complexities of this new legislation, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 to provide companies with transitional relief. Specifically, while the initial accounting for items under the new legislation was incomplete, the guidance allowed the recognition of provisional amounts when reasonable estimates could be made or the continued application of the prior tax law if a reasonable estimate of the effect could not be made. The SEC staff provided up to one year for companies to finalize the accounting for the effects of this new legislation. During 2018, we recognized $7.8 million of tax benefit related to changes made to the provisional amounts, primarily related to our transition tax and from revaluing our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nDuring 2017, we paid $7.6 million to settle a net investment hedge that we entered into in 2017 for the purpose of mitigating a portion of the foreign currency risk on the euro net investment in a foreign subsidiary. As of December 31, 2017, we had entered into another net investment hedge intended to mitigate the same risk with an outstanding maturity of twelve months.\n \u2022 Diluted earnings per share decreased 26.5%. \nWe also recognize revenue from other customer contract types, including licensing of intellectual property, software licensing and post-contract support (PCS) which may be sold as part of a bundled product offering or as a separate contract. For bundled product arrangements, the transaction price is allocated based on the relative standalone estimated selling price of each performance obligation. Distinct intellectual property obligations, including software, are considered functional in nature and are recognized as revenue at the point in time the customer receives the rights to use and benefit from the intellectual property or are determined using a usage-based royalty. PCS obligations are typically recognized over the term of the contract.\nWe establish deferred tax liabilities for the estimated tax cost associated with foreign earnings that we do not consider permanently reinvested (primarily foreign withholding and state income taxes). These liabilities are subject to adjustment if there is a change in the assertion of whether the foreign earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested.\n \n (1) See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\u201d within this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below. \nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense for 2018 was lower than 2017 due primarily to benefits from cost reduction initiatives and lower costs related to the integration of the Broadband Network Solutions (BNS) business acquired from TE Connectivity in 2015. These decreases in costs were partially offset by higher transaction costs related to the pending acquisition of ARRIS, higher incentive compensation expense and higher bad debt expense in 2018. SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased from the prior year as a result of these overall net reductions in expense.\nOperating Activities\nDuring 2016, we repaid $150.0 million of our senior secured term loan due in 2018 and voluntarily redeemed $536.6 million of the 6.625%/7.375% senior payment-in-kind toggle notes (the senior PIK toggle notes). In connection with the repayment and redemption, we wrote off $7.1 million of debt issuance costs and original issue discount to interest expense during 2016.\nWe record a contract asset for unbilled accounts receivable related to revenue that has been recognized in advance of consideration being unconditionally due from the customer, which is common for certain project contract performance obligations. Contract asset amounts are transferred to accounts receivable when our right to the consideration becomes unconditional, which varies by contract, but is generally based on achieving certain acceptance milestones.\nComparison of results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 with the year ended December 31, 2017\nGross profit, SG&A expense and R&D expense\n\nWe believe that presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures enhances an investor's understanding of our financial performance. We further believe that these financial measures are useful in assessing our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business. We also use certain of these financial measures for business planning purposes and in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors. We believe these financial measures are commonly used by investors to evaluate our performance and the performance of our competitors. However, our use of the terms non-GAAP adjusted operating income and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA may vary from that of others in our industry. These financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to operating income (loss), net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP as measures of operating performance, operating cash flows or liquidity.\nDuring 2018, we generated $494.1 million of cash through operating activities compared to $586.3 million during 2017. The lower level of cash generation was primarily due to lower earnings, increases in cash used to build inventory and higher cash payments for interest and taxes. The decreases were offset partially by lower payments of incentive compensation compared with the prior year.\nAdopted in 2018\nNet periodic benefit income of $9.1 million, excluding the amounts discussed above, was included in other expense, net for 2018 as a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. Other expense, net for 2017 was recast to include $5.6 million of net periodic benefit income as a result of the new guidance. See the discussion under Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding the adoption of this new accounting guidance.\nNet sales. Net sales for 2017 were lower across all regions compared to the prior year except the EMEA region, with the U.S. and APAC region having the largest declines. Net sales to customers located outside of the U.S. comprised 46% of total net sales for both 2017 and 2016. Foreign exchange rate changes did not significantly impact net sales for 2017 compared to 2016.\n (a) No prepayment or redemption of any of our long-term debt balances has been assumed. Refer to Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding the terms of our long-term debt agreements. \nForeign exchange losses of $8.7 million were included in other expense, net for 2017 compared to losses of $9.5 million for 2016.\nDuring 2018 and 2017, we sold property and equipment no longer being utilized for $12.9 million and $5.4 million, respectively.\n\nOther expense, net. In connection with the redemption of the 2020 Notes during 2017, we paid a redemption premium of $14.8 million which was included in other expense, net. In May 2017, we amended the 2022 Term Loan to reduce the interest rate margin, and in connection with the amendment, we incurred debt modification costs of $1.1 million which were included in other expense, net for 2017. In connection with the debt redeemed or repaid during 2016, we incurred redemption premiums of $17.7 million and other fees of $1.2 million which were included in other expense, net.\nDuring 2017, we acquired Cable Exchange and paid $105.2 million, net of cash acquired, using cash on hand. Also during 2017, we received proceeds of $9.9 million related to the sale of the remainder of our investment in Hydrogenics.\nNet interest expense, Other expense, net and Income taxes\nCCS segment operating income and non-GAAP adjusted operating income decreased for 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to lower sales volumes, price reductions, unfavorable geographic and product mix and higher material costs. These decreases were partially offset by the favorable impact of cost reduction initiatives and lower incentive compensation. The decrease in CCS segment operating income was also partially offset by lower intangible asset amortization, lower impairment charges and lower integration and transaction costs during 2017 compared to 2016. The impacts of intangible asset amortization, impairment charges and integration and transaction costs are excluded from the calculation of non-GAAP adjusted operating income.\nIn July 2018, we repaid $400.0 million of the 2022 Term Loan. The payment was made using $250.0 million of cash on hand and $150.0 million borrowed under our asset-based revolving credit facility (the revolving credit facility) which was repaid during the third quarter of 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the remaining availability was $463.1 million, reflecting a borrowing base of $492.6 million reduced by $29.5 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility. During 2018, we received proceeds of $6.1 million related to the exercise of stock options. Also during 2018, employees surrendered 407,938 shares of our common stock to satisfy their tax withholding requirements on vested restricted stock units and performance share units, which reduced cash flows by $15.7 million.\nWe are a global provider of infrastructure solutions for communication networks. Our solutions and services for wired and wireless networks enable high-bandwidth data, video and voice applications. Our portfolio includes innovative wireless and fiber optic solutions for today's evolving digital lifestyle. Our global leadership position is built upon innovative technology, broad solution offerings, high-quality and cost-effective customer solutions and global manufacturing and distribution scale. Our talented and experienced global team helps customers increase bandwidth; maximize existing capacity; improve network response time and performance; and simplify technology migration. Our solutions are found in some of the largest venues and outdoor spaces; in buildings and data centers of all sizes and complexities; at wireless cell sites; in telecom central offices and cable headends; in fiber-to-the-X (FTTX) deployments; and in airports, trains, and tunnels. Vital networks around the world run on CommScope solutions.\nCCS segment net sales were lower in 2017 compared to 2016 in all regions except the EMEA region. The decrease was driven by the U.S. and the APAC region as a result of a slowdown in the rollout of new projects by certain North American service providers, continued weakness in demand for our indoor network products, and certain large projects in the APAC region in 2016 that did not recur in 2017. In addition, we experienced BNS integration issues early in 2017 that negatively affected customer service levels and order rates. Incremental sales related to the Cable Exchange acquisition completed in August 2017 were not material to the CCS segment for 2017. Foreign exchange rate changes did not significantly impact segment sales for 2017 compared to 2016.\nWe adopted ASU No. 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, on January 1, 2018. The new standard requires an employer to report the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the employee and requires the other components of net periodic benefit cost to be reported outside the subtotal of operating income. Of the total $19.8 million of net periodic benefit cost for year ended December 31, 2018, $15.7 million of net periodic benefit cost was recorded in other expense, net, and $4.1 million of net periodic benefit cost was recorded within operating income. We utilized the practical expedient and used the amounts disclosed in our employee benefit plans note for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 as the basis for applying the retrospective presentation requirements. We reclassified $5.6 million and $7.1 million of net periodic benefit income from operating income to other expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on the previously reported income before income taxes or net income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nDuring 2018 and 2017, we received $5.1 million and paid $7.6 million, respectively, to settle net investment hedges that we entered into for the purpose of mitigating a portion of the foreign currency risk on the euro net investment in a foreign subsidiary.\nWe establish an income tax valuation allowance when available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider the amounts, character, source and timing of expected future deductions or carryforwards as well as sources of taxable income and tax planning strategies that may enable utilization. We maintain an existing valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal. Changes in the amount or timing of expected future deductions or taxable income may have a material impact on the level of income tax valuation allowances. If we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of a deferred tax asset in the future, an increase to an income tax valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made.\nNet sales\nWe adopted ASU No. 2016-16, Accounting for Income Taxes, Intra-Entity Asset Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory, on January 1, 2018. Under previous guidance, the tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers were deferred until the transferred asset was sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use. The new guidance eliminates the exception for all intra-entity sales of assets other than inventory. As a result, the tax effect of an intra-entity asset sale would be recognized when the transfer occurs. We recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $2.6 million as of January 1, 2018 that decreased the accumulated deficit on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a result of this new guidance.\n\nProduct Warranty Reserves\nCCS Segment\nOur effective income tax rate of 7.6% for 2017 reflected the impact of U.S. tax reform enacted in December 2017. Our effective income tax rate was also favorably affected by changes in tax legislation in certain other jurisdictions and a reduction in tax expense related to the expiration of statutes of limitations on various uncertain tax positions. In addition, the effective tax rate was favorably affected by $14.4 million of excess tax benefits related to equity-based compensation awards for 2017.\nThe following table summarizes certain key measures of our liquidity and capital resources:\n\n</table>\nTax Valuation Allowances and Liabilities for Unrecognized Tax Benefits\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n (1) See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\" within this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below. \nImpairment Reviews of Goodwill\nOur sales to wireless operators are volatile. We expect longer-term demand for our CMS products to be positively affected by wireless coverage and capacity expansion in emerging markets and growth in mobile data services and network capacity requirements in developed markets. In addition, we expect demand for our CMS products to continue to be favorably affected by government initiatives to promote the expansion of wireless networks (e.g., FirstNet), new spectrum deployments (e.g., Citizen's Broadband Radio Service or CBRS) and a venue refresh cycle over the next couple of years. We also expect longer-term demand for our CMS products to be positively affected by the introduction of 5G technology. In preparation for 5G networks, we continue to invest heavily in R&D, support customer trials and participate in industry forums to help shape 5G standards. Uncertainty in the global economy or a particular region or consolidation among or other investments by wireless operators may slow the growth or cause a decline in capital spending by wireless operators and negatively impact our net sales. We expect modest near-term net sales growth in the CMS segment as a result of these business dynamics as well as ongoing pricing pressure.\nComparison for the year ended December 31, 2017 with the year ended December 31, 2016\nInvesting Activities\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the first half of 2017, we paid cash of $100.0 million to repurchase stock under the stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in February 2017. We had no remaining authorization under this stock repurchase program as of December 31, 2017. In August 2017, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase plan of up to $100.0 million. We paid cash of $75.0 million to repurchase stock under this plan during 2017. We had $25.0 million of remaining authorization under this stock repurchase program as of December 31, 2017. The repurchase authorization under this plan expired on July 31, 2018.\nNM - Not meaningful\nThe following critical accounting policies and estimates reflected in our financial statements are based on management's knowledge of and experience with past and current events and on management's assumptions about future events. While we have generally not experienced significant deviations from our critical estimates in the past, it is reasonably possible that these estimates may ultimately differ materially from actual results. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of all of our significant accounting policies.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test of Goodwill Impairment, which eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under the new guidance, an entity will perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity will recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. ASU No. 2017-04 is effective for us as of January 1, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. We plan to adopt this new guidance as of January 1, 2019 and do not anticipate that adoption will materially affect the consolidated financial statements.\n\nSegment Results\nInvestment in property, plant and equipment during 2018 was $82.3 million compared with $68.7 million for the prior year. The investment in property, plant and equipment was primarily related to supporting improvements in manufacturing operations, including expanding production capacity and investing in information technology, including software developed for internal use.\nOperating Activities\nThe change in other expense, net for 2018 compared to the prior year was also impacted by a redemption premium of $14.8 million incurred during the first quarter of 2017 in connection with the redemption of the 2020 Notes, partially offset by $9.0 million in gains recognized during 2017 related to the sale of our investment in Hydrogenics Corporation.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\n\n</td> </tr>\nThe annual test of goodwill was performed for each of the reporting units with goodwill balances as of October 1, 2018. The weighted average discount rates used in the 2018 annual test were 9.5% for the CCS reporting units and 10.0% for the CMS reporting units. These discount rates were unchanged from those used in the 2017 annual goodwill impairment tests. Based on the estimated fair values generated by our DCF models, the reporting units passed the annual goodwill impairment test. The Company considered the sensitivity to changes in key assumptions for the reporting unit with the lowest level of headroom and determined that a fifty basis point change in the discount rate or long-term growth rate would result in a potential impairment. Accordingly, if performance is worse than anticipated, future impairment tests could result in impairment charges that could be material to our results of operations.\n (2) Total capitalization includes long-term debt, including the current portion, and stockholders' equity. \nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we early adopted ASU No. 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which allows companies to elect reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for certain tax effects resulting from the U.S. tax legislation enacted in 2017. Our policy is to generally recognize the tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income at the currently enacted tax rate and reclassify it to net income in the same period that the related pre-tax accumulated comprehensive income reclassifications are recognized. We did not elect the permitted reclassification and therefore adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome tax expense. Our effective income tax rate of 7.6% for 2017 reflected the impact of U.S. tax reform enacted in December 2017. Our effective income tax rate was also favorably affected by changes in tax legislation in certain other jurisdictions and a reduction in tax expense related to the expiration of statutes of limitations on various uncertain tax positions. The effective tax rate was also favorably affected by $14.4 million of excess tax benefits related to equity-based compensation awards for 2017.\n (a) Reflects integration costs related to the acquisition of the BNS business, transaction costs related to potential and consummated acquisitions and costs related to secondary stock offerings. \nWorking capital, excluding cash and cash equivalents, decreased during 2018. The decrease was mainly due to lower accounts receivable balances due to the timing of net sales. This decrease was partially offset by lower accounts payable balances and higher inventory balances as of December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. The net reduction in total capitalization during 2018 reflected the repayment of $400.0 million on the 2022 Term Loan and foreign currency translation losses partially offset by current year earnings.\n\n \u2022 Net income decreased 27.7%; and \nAmortization of purchased intangible assets, Restructuring costs and Asset impairments\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under \"Risk Factors\" included in Part I, Item 1A or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur principal sources of liquidity on a short-term basis are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows provided by operations and availability under credit facilities. Refer to Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding the terms of our credit agreements as of December 31, 2018. To fund the Pending Acquisition, on February 19, 2019 we issued $1.25 billion of 5.50% senior secured notes due 2024, $1.5 billion of 6.00% senior secured notes due 2026 and $1.0 billion of 8.25% senior unsecured notes due 2027 and priced the borrowing of $3.2 billion under a new senior secured term loan due 2026 with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.25%. The proceeds of the notes were placed into escrow and will be released upon consummation of the Pending Acquisition, and it is expected that the new senior secured term loan will be borrowed at closing of the Pending Acquisition. We expect to use a portion of the new senior secured term loan to pay off our existing senior secured term loan due December 2022. We also expect to enter into a new asset-based revolving credit facility in an amount of up to $1.0 billion, subject to borrowing base capacity. In addition to the new debt, we expect to fund the Pending Acquisition by issuing 1.0 million shares of series A convertible preferred stock to the Carlyle Group for $1,000 per share, or an aggregate investment of $1.0 billion. On a long-term basis, our potential sources of liquidity include raising capital through additional issuances of debt and/or equity.\nWe also establish allowances related to value-added and similar recoverable taxes when it is considered probable that those assets are not recoverable. Changes in the probability of recovery or in the estimates of the amount recoverable are recognized in the period such determination is made and may be material to earnings.\nIn August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2018-15, Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement (CCA) that is a Service Contract, which aligns the accounting for costs incurred to implement a CCA that is a service arrangement with the guidance on capitalizing costs associated with developing or obtaining internal-use software. ASU No. 2018-15 is effective for us as of January 1, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact of the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements and when it will be adopted.\nCommScope Mobility Solutions Segment\nWe continually attempt to minimize the effect of inflation on earnings by controlling our operating costs and adjusting our selling prices. The principal raw materials purchased by us (copper, aluminum, steel, plastics and other polymers, bimetals and optical fiber) are subject to changes in market price as they are influenced by commodity markets and other factors. Prices for copper, fluoropolymers and certain other polymers derived from oil and natural gas have, at times, been volatile. As a result, we have adjusted our prices for certain products and may have to adjust prices again in the future. To the extent that we are unable to pass on cost increases to customers without a significant decrease in sales volume or must implement price reductions in response to a rapid decline in raw material costs, these cost changes could have a material adverse impact on the results of our operations.\nContractual Obligations\nSelling, general and administrative expense. SG&A expense for 2017 was lower than 2016 due primarily to lower incentive compensation expense and benefits from cost reduction initiatives. Despite lower net sales, SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased from 2016 as a result of these lower costs.\nWe adopted ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, on January 1, 2018. This new guidance modifies how entities measure equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting) and present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities; simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment; changes presentation and disclosure requirements; and clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity's other deferred tax assets. Adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n (1) See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\" in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below. \n\n\nWe adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, including all subsequently issued clarifying guidance, on January 1, 2018. The core principle of the new guidance is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. We adopted the standard using the modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of applying the standard on the date of adoption recognized in retained earnings (accumulated deficit).\nForeign exchange losses of $29.9 million were included in other expense, net for 2018 compared to foreign exchange losses of $8.7 million for 2017. The 2018 amount included a $14.0 million pretax loss related to foreign currency translation adjustments previously reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss that were recognized in other expense, net due to the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary.\nCMS segment operating income and non-GAAP adjusted operating income decreased in 2018 primarily due to selling price reductions and unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes impacting costs, partially offset by favorable product and geographic mix and higher sales volumes. CMS segment operating income was also impacted by higher restructuring costs and the impairment of our equity investment in a privately-owned entity in 2018, which are both excluded from non-GAAP adjusted operating income. See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\u201d within this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below.\nCommScope Connectivity Solutions Segment\n\nIssued but Not Adopted\nDuring 2017, we generated $586.3 million of cash through operating activities compared to $640.2 million during 2016. The lower level of cash generation was primarily due to the prior year benefit generated from the extension of vendor payment terms as well as higher 2016 incentive compensation which was paid in 2017 and lower operating performance in 2017 compared to 2016. These declines were partially offset by higher cash flow from accounts receivable due to changes in the timing of sales and collections as well as approximately $59.2 million of customer payments received in late 2017 that were not due until 2018. In addition, we paid lower cash taxes and cash interest during 2017 than in 2016.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The new guidance replaces the current incurred loss method used for determining credit losses on financial assets, including trade receivables, with an expected credit loss method. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for us as of January 1, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact of the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 Operating income decreased 4.7%; \nAmortization of purchased intangible assets. The amortization of purchased intangible assets was lower for 2017 compared to 2016 primarily because certain of our intangible assets became fully amortized. This was partially offset by the amortization of intangible assets related to the Cable Exchange acquisition.\nCommScope Connectivity Solutions Segment\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe recognize income tax benefits related to particular tax positions only when it is considered more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained if examined on its technical merits by tax authorities. The amount of benefit recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is evaluated to be greater than 50% likely to be realized. Considerable judgment is required to evaluate the technical merits of various positions and to evaluate the likely amount of benefit to be realized. Lapses in statutes of limitations, developments in tax laws, regulations and interpretations, and changes in assessments of the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions could have a material impact on the overall tax provision.\nOur effective income tax rate of 18.2% for 2016 was lower than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to a reduction in tax expense related to the release of valuation allowances related to certain federal tax credit carryforwards and certain other deferred tax assets. The effective income tax rate was also favorably affected by the reduction of reserves for uncertain tax positions and earnings in foreign jurisdictions that we did not plan to repatriate. These foreign earnings were generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S. Offsetting these decreases in 2016 was the effect of the provision for state income taxes as well as the goodwill impairment charge for which only partial tax benefits were recorded.\nWe expect demand for our indoor network CCS products to be driven by global information technology spending, particularly for hyperscale and cloud data center networks, as the ongoing need for bandwidth and intelligence in the network continues to create demand for high-performance connectivity solutions. We expect demand for our outdoor network CCS products to be driven by global deployment of fiber-optic solutions for fiber-to-the-X applications, new services, densification, competitive dynamics in the access market, ongoing maintenance requirements of cable networks and residential construction market activity in North America. Spending patterns by service providers and data center customers can be volatile. Uncertain global economic conditions, variability in the levels of commercial and residential construction activity, consolidation among service providers, uncertain levels of information technology spending and reductions in the levels of distributor inventories may negatively affect demand for our products. The increasing demand for fiber solutions is expected to be somewhat offset by decelerating demand for copper solutions in networks. We expect modest near-term net sales growth in the CCS segment as a result of these business dynamics as well as ongoing pricing pressure.\nInvesting Activities\n (b) Interest on long-term debt excludes the amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount. Interest on variable rate debt is estimated based upon rates in effect as of December 31, 2018. \nOther expense, net. In 2018, we terminated a significant U.S. defined benefit pension plan which was settled through the purchase of annuities. As a result of the settlement, we recognized a pretax charge in other expense, net primarily related to unrecognized net actuarial losses previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $34.5 million. We also amended certain of our U.S. postretirement medical plans to terminate benefits as of December 31, 2018. We recognized a pretax gain in other expense, net in 2018 of $9.7 million related to unrecognized prior service credits and unrecognized net actuarial gains previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nRestructuring costs, net. The restructuring costs for 2017 and 2016 were primarily related to the continuing integration of the BNS acquisition.\nDuring 2017, we received proceeds of $9.9 million related to the exercise of stock options. Also during 2017, employees surrendered 411,932 shares of our common stock to satisfy their tax withholding requirements on vested restricted stock units and performance share units, which reduced cash flows by $15.4 million.\n (1) See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\u201d within this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below. \nCMS segment net sales were relatively unchanged during 2018 compared to 2017. The CMS segment saw higher sales volumes in the U.S. primarily as a result of government initiatives to promote the expansion of wireless networks. The increase in U.S. sales volumes was offset partially by reductions in certain selling prices. The increase in CMS segment net sales in the U.S. was largely offset by decreases in the APAC region. Foreign exchange rate changes were not significant to CMS segment net sales for 2018.\n (1) Working capital consists of current assets of $1,877.8 million less current liabilities of $690.6 million as of December 31, 2018 and current assets of $1,943.9 million less current liabilities of $723.7 million as of December 31, 2017. \n (d) Amounts reflect expected contributions related to payments under the postretirement benefit plans through 2028 and expected pension contributions of $5.0 million in 2019 (see Note 10 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). \n2018 Annual Goodwill Analysis\nCCS segment operating income increased during 2018 compared to the prior year while non-GAAP adjusted operating income decreased slightly. CCS segment operating income benefitted from lower integration costs and restructuring costs offset by the impairment of our equity investment in a privately-owned entity in 2018, all of which are excluded from non-GAAP adjusted operating income. Both operating income and non-GAAP adjusted operating income benefitted from higher sales volumes, favorable product and geographic mix and cost savings initiatives that were partially offset by selling price reductions, higher material costs and unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes impacting costs. See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\u201d within this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below.\n (f) Due to the uncertainty in predicting the timing of tax payments related to our unrecognized tax benefits, $17.3 million has been excluded from the presentation. We anticipate a reduction of up to $5.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months (see Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). \nCash Flow Overview\nNet interest expense, Other expense, net and Income taxes\nOn November 8, 2018, we announced that we have entered into an agreement to acquire ARRIS International plc (ARRIS) (the Pending Acquisition) in an all cash transaction with a total purchase price of approximately $7.4 billion, or $31.75 per outstanding ARRIS share. We expect the transaction to close during the first half of 2019. See Part I, Item 1, Business-Strategy-ARRIS Acquisition Rationale\u201d for a discussion of strategy behind the acquisition of ARRIS and see Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors-ARRIS Acquisition Risks\u201d for a discussion of risks related to the pending acquisition of ARRIS.\nFinancing Activities\nSegment Results\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets, Restructuring costs and Asset impairments\nManagement reviews definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable. This analysis differs from our goodwill impairment analysis in that an intangible or other long-lived asset impairment is only deemed to have occurred if the sum of the forecasted undiscounted future net cash flows related to the assets being evaluated is less than the carrying value of the assets. If the forecasted net cash flows are less than the carrying value, then the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. During 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of $15.0 million allocated equally to the CCS and CMS segments related to our equity investment in a privately-held company. Other than this equity investment impairment and other certain assets abandoned or disposed of as part of restructuring actions, we did not identify any other impairments of definite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived assets in 2018. Changes in the estimates of forecasted net cash flows may result in future asset impairments that could be material to our results of operations.\nWe adopted ASU No. 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, on January 1, 2018. The new guidance provides targeted improvements to the hedge accounting model intended to allow financial reporting to more closely reflect an entity's risk management activities and to simplify the application of hedge accounting. Beginning January 1, 2018, we elected to assess the effectiveness of our net investment hedges using the spot rate method. As a result, differences between the spot rate and the forward rate will be amortized to earnings on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract. See Note 7 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10- K for further details on our derivative and hedging activities and the related impacts to the financial statements.\nResearch and development. R&D expense decreased for 2017 compared to 2016 primarily as a result of lower incentive compensation expense. R&D expense as a percentage of sales remained unchanged from 2016.\n (c) Purchase obligations and other supplier agreements include payments of $21.7 million due in 2019 for minimum amounts owed under take-or-pay or requirements contracts. Amounts covered by open purchase orders are excluded as there is no contractual obligation until goods or services are received. This item also includes $11.1 million and $3.6 million of purchase price payments due in 2019 and 2020, respectively, related to the acquisition of Cable Exchange. \nITEM 7.\nDuring 2017, we received proceeds of $9.9 million related to the sale of the remainder of our investment in Hydrogenics. During 2016, we received $1.3 million in proceeds related to the sale of a portion of that investment.\n \u2022 Net sales were essentially flat with an increase of less than 1%; \nCMS Segment\nOVERVIEW\nThe CMS segment experienced a decrease in net sales for 2017 compared to 2016 in all major regions, with the decrease being most pronounced in the U.S. and the APAC region. While CMS segment net sales benefited from increased spending by certain domestic operators in the first quarter of 2017, we saw a slowdown in their spending during the remainder of 2017. The decline in sales of our CMS products in the APAC region was primarily due to certain large projects in 2016 that did not recur during 2017. Foreign exchange rate changes did not significantly impact segment sales for 2017 compared to 2016.\nWe report financial performance based on two operating segments: CommScope Connectivity Solutions (CCS) and CommScope Mobility Solutions (CMS). For an overview of our operating segments, see Part I, Item I Business - Operating Segments.\u201d\nFor project contracts containing multiple distinct performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated based on the relative standalone estimated selling price of each performance obligation. The relative standalone selling price is determined using current price lists and observable pricing in separate contracts with similar customers. For performance obligations recognized over-time, judgment is required to evaluate assumptions, including the total estimated costs to determine progress towards completion of the performance obligation and to calculate the corresponding amount of revenue to recognize. If estimated total costs on any contract are greater than the net contract revenues, the entire estimated loss is recognized in the period the loss becomes known. The cumulative effects on revenue from revisions to total estimated costs are recorded in the period in which the revisions to estimates are identified and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.\nRevenue Recognition\nNM - Not meaningful\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled, based on customer contracts. For sales to distributors, system integrators and value-added resellers (primarily for CCS segment), revenue is adjusted for variable consideration amounts, including estimated discounts, returns, rebates and distributor price protection programs. These estimates are determined based upon historical experience, contract terms, inventory levels in the distributor channel and other related factors. Adjustments to variable consideration estimates are recorded when circumstances indicate revisions may be necessary.\nWe recognize revenue based on the satisfaction of distinct obligations to transfer goods and services to customers. The majority of our revenue is from product sales. Revenue from product sales is recognized when control is transferred to the customer, typically upon either shipment or delivery. A minor portion of our revenue is derived from project contracts containing a combination of product and service obligations. Revenue from project contracts is recognized either at a point in time or over time using cost input methods, based on the specific terms of each contract.\nFrom a segment perspective, net sales from the CCS segment and the CMS segment in 2018 were both relatively unchanged compared to 2017. CCS segment net sales in the EMEA region and in the U.S. both increased but these were mostly offset by decreases in the APAC region. Net sales from the CMS segment increased in the U.S. but that increase was mostly offset by decreases in the APAC region. For further details by segment, see the section titled Segment Results\u201d below.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\nA contract liability for deferred revenue is recorded when consideration is received or is unconditionally due from a customer prior to transferring control of goods or services to the customer under the terms of a contract. Deferred revenue balances typically result from advance payments received from customers for product contracts or from billings in excess of revenue recognized on project or services arrangements.\nInvestment in property, plant and equipment during 2017 was $68.7 million compared with $68.3 million for the prior year. The investment in property, plant and equipment was primarily related to supporting improvements in manufacturing operations, including expanding production capacity and investing in information technology, including software developed for internal use.\nDefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nOur weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings, including the amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount, was 5.45% at December 31, 2017 and 5.24% at December 31, 2016.\n (e) Future restructuring payments exclude payments due under lease arrangements which are included in operating leases above. \nDuring 2017, we issued the 2027 Notes for $750.0 million and the proceeds, together with cash on hand, were used to (i) redeem all $500.0 million of the outstanding 2020 Notes, (ii) repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our senior secured term loans, including $111.9 million of outstanding principal on our senior secured term loan due 2018 and $138.1 million of outstanding principal on the 2022 Term Loan, and (iii) pay related fees and expenses. We paid a $14.8 million premium to redeem the 2020 Notes and paid $7.2 million in debt issuance costs related to the 2027 Notes. In addition, during 2017, we amended the 2022 Term Loan to reduce the interest rate margin by 50 basis points which resulted in the repayment of $30.4 million to certain lenders under the senior secured credit facilities and the receipt of $30.4 million in proceeds from the new lenders and existing lenders who increased their positions. We also paid $1.1 million in debt modification costs related to this amendment. Also during 2017, we voluntarily repaid $210.0 million of the 2022 Term Loan. During 2017, we paid cash of $175.0 million to repurchase stock under stock repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors in 2017. The repurchase authorization expired on July 31, 2018. In addition, we received proceeds of $9.9 million related to the exercise of stock options and employees surrendered 411,932 shares of our common stock to satisfy their tax withholding requirements on vested restricted stock units, which reduced cash flows by $15.4 million.\nAsset impairments. During 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of $15.0 million allocated equally to the CCS and CMS segments to fully impair an equity investment in a privately-held company. We did not record any asset impairment charges during 2017.\nWe test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment annually as of October 1 and on an interim basis when events occur or circumstances indicate the carrying value may no longer be recoverable. The goodwill impairment test starts with a comparison of the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value. We estimate the fair value of a reporting unit through the use of a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation model. The significant assumptions in the DCF model are the annual revenue growth rate, the annual operating income margin and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flow projections. Among other inputs, the annual revenue growth rate and operating income margin are determined by management using historical performance trends, industry data, insight derived from customers, relevant changes in the reporting unit's underlying business and other market trends that may affect the reporting unit. The discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital as of the test date of market participants in the industry in which the reporting unit operates. The assumptions used in the DCF model are subject to significant judgment and uncertainty. Changes in projected revenue growth rates, projected operating income margins or estimated discount rates due to uncertain market conditions, loss of one or more key customers, changes in technology, or other factors, could result in one or more of our reporting units with a significant amount of goodwill failing the goodwill impairment test in the future. It is possible that future impairment reviews may indicate additional impairments of goodwill, which could be material to our results of operations and financial position. Our historical or projected revenues or cash flows may not be indicative of actual future results.\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td>\n\nEffects of Inflation and Changing Prices\nConsolidated\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets. The amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased for 2018 compared to the prior year because certain of our intangible assets became fully amortized. This decrease was partially offset during 2018 by the amortization of intangible assets related to the Cable Exchange acquisition that occurred in August 2017.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we early adopted ASU No. 2018-14, Disclosure Framework: Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans, which adds disclosure requirements identified as relevant for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans, removes disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial, and clarifies existing guidance for certain disclosure requirements. The impact on our disclosures was to remove the disclosure of the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss expected to be recognized as net periodic benefit cost in the next year and to provide explanations of significant gains and losses related to the changes in the benefit obligation for the period. The impacts were applied retrospectively to the disclosures for all periods presented. The adoption of this ASU only affected the disclosures on our defined benefit pension plans and did not affect our consolidated financial statements. See Note 10 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10- K for further discussion of our defined benefit pension plans.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which supersedes the current leasing guidance in Topic 840, Leases. Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize assets and lease liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leased assets previously classified as operating leases. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for us as of January 1, 2019. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, which allows entities a transition election to recognize the effects of applying the new leasing standard as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings (accumulated deficit) as opposed to restating comparative periods for the effects of applying the new standard. We expect to elect this transition approach. We are finalizing the necessary changes to our accounting policies, processes, internal controls and information systems that will be required to meet the new standard's reporting and disclosure requirements. The majority of our leased asset value relates to real estate with the remainder primarily related to vehicles and equipment. We estimate that adoption of the new standard will increase total assets and total liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets by $95 million to $100 million due to the addition of right-of-use assets and lease obligations for operating type leases, net of the elimination of existing prepaid rent, deferred rent and lease termination cost amounts. We do not expect the adoption of the new standard to significantly affect the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income or the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nInventory Reserves\nDuring 2017, we acquired Cable Exchange and paid $105.2 million, net of cash acquired, using cash on hand. We recorded a noncurrent liability for the remaining $14.5 million of payments due to the sellers. During 2016, we received adjustments to the BNS acquisition purchase price of $7.1 million and paid $1.0 million as a final payment on a previous acquisition.\n\nNet sales. Net sales for 2018 were essentially flat compared to 2017. Net sales in the U.S. and the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region increased in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase in the U.S. was driven by higher sales volumes primarily as a result of government initiatives to promote the expansion of wireless networks but was partially offset by reductions in certain selling prices. Net sales in the U.S. also benefitted from incremental net sales in 2018 related to the acquisition of Cable Exchange on August 1, 2017. The increase in net sales in the EMEA region for 2018 was driven mostly by favorable foreign exchange rate changes. These increases in net sales were largely offset by decreases in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region as a result of projects in 2017 that did not recur in 2018. Net sales in the Caribbean and Latin America (CALA) region also decreased in 2018 with higher sales volumes being more than offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes. Net sales to customers located outside of the U.S. comprised 44% for 2018 compared to 46% for 2017.\nNet interest expense. Net interest expense for 2018 decreased due to lower long-term debt balances as a result of the voluntary repayments in the fourth quarter of 2017 and in July 2018 on the senior secured term loan due 2022 (the 2022 Term Loan) as well as the May 2017 amendment to reduce the interest rate margin on the 2022 Term Loan. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in LIBOR. In connection with the repayment of the 2022 Term Loan in July 2018, we wrote off $7.4 million of debt issuance costs and original issue discount. Similarly, in 2017, we wrote off $14.1 million of debt issuance costs and original issue discount in connection with the redemption of $500.0 million of 4.375% senior secured notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes) and the repayment of $460.0 million of senior secured term loans. The redemption of the 2020 Notes and the repayment of the senior secured term loans were substantially funded by the issuance in March 2017 of $750.0 million of 5.00% senior notes due 2027 (the 2027 Notes).\nDuring 2017, we amended the 2022 Term Loan to reduce the interest rate margin by 50 basis points which resulted in the repayment of $30.4 million to certain lenders under the senior secured credit facilities and the receipt of $30.4 million in proceeds from the new lenders and existing lenders who increased their positions. We also paid $1.1 million in debt modification costs related to this amendment. In addition, we voluntarily repaid $210.0 million of the 2022 Term Loan during 2017.\nWe are not a party to any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, except for operating leases. There have not been any material changes to our off-balance sheet arrangements during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nFrom a segment perspective, CCS segment net sales decreased by 5.3% and CMS segment net sales decreased by 10.6% for 2017 compared to the prior year due to lower sales in both domestic and international markets. For further details by segment, see the section titled Segment Results\u201d below.\n", "item_7_tables": "Table 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td>

"The report provides a comprehensive financial analysis for a company with the fiscal year ending December 31. It includes detailed information on net sales by segment, operating income, adjustments, and various financial metrics. Notably:\n\n- Consolidated net sales slightly increased by 0.2% to $4,568.5 million from $4,560.6 million in the previous year.\n- CCS segment sales remained stable, showing a marginal 0.1% increase from $2,809.8 million to $2,812.7 million.\n- CMS segment sales saw a slight 0.3% increase from $1,750.8 million to $1,755.8 million.\n- Consolidated operating income decreased by 4.7%, from $472.0 million to $450.0 million.\n- Non-GAAP adjusted operating income also decreased by 4.4% from $876.7 million to $838.0 million.\n\nThe report discusses asset impairments, indicating that there were no recorded charges in 2017, unlike in 2016 when impairment charges were recorded across several sectors within the CCS segment.\n\nProduct warranties are noted, which can vary from one to twenty-five years, depending on the product. The company makes provisions for future warranty claims based on historical data and identified issues, but acknowledges that actual results could materially differ from estimates.\n\nThe report also covers the impact of the adoption of new accounting standards, including those on revenue recognition and pension cost reporting. Adoption adjustments resulting from revenue recognition standards are mentioned, with a net effect that decreased the accumulated deficit by $3.4 million.\n\nGross profit declined due to decreased sales volume, price reductions, and higher material costs which were not fully offset by cost reduction initiatives.\n\nLastly, the report includes a financial outlook that highlights the company's sources of liquidity, including cash flows, borrowing capacity, and access to capital markets, to meet anticipated future cash needs. It also mentions the potential volatility in cash flows and the possibility of new borrowings or issuing securities subject to market conditions."}
